1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,349
whether it's about here's another
example

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:04,910
all those things matter

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,540
and trying to do this work

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,689
that's part of what i've been trying to
assess to identify what it means for you

5
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:15,469
i wasn't really to a larger group roller
coaster needs

6
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:17,170
and has been completed

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,630
it's been com what's in your esteemed
very pleasant and a fine actor gets and

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,900
at that point the

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,580
what is exactly what's going on
influenced don't define acting in a

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,929
malicious content could have another her
boarded

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,809
then what are they doing identifying
themselves as such in other words

12
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,170
so that's essentially

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,490
the process that began going through

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,610
you doing my research there were very
few

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,990
so uh... trying to identify some friend
asked specific questions not only

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,160
according to clinton

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,530
so

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,550
security question he'd experienced
things different

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,740
what happens in the context

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,130
uh... the coming back

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,020
however you define

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,300
what happens when you were involved in

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,020
agriculture you experience things to be
negative way

24
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,420
the rest more of your

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,390
freely given some sort of automatic why
is that how it you've got to take and

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,479
what he did something like that but my
protector

27
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:14,450
facilitators

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,960
interesting questions as we can act

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,700
when we need to think about it

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,290
based on computer science ect

31
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,390
when we consider what's going on

32
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,970
the number of women were groceries
computer science or technical degrees

33
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,950
is relatively small

34
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,890
it's for a little bit we're talking like
twenty five percent something like that

35
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,790
so that there is some hope portion of
the total number of people seeking to do

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,630
it

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,180
so small in fantastic for me at some
point

38
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,400
institute the

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,960
late ninety three one two thousand stark
and brutal

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,150
and he hopes that there is an
automatically some sort of a variation

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,729
in turns of good number of people
participate

42
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,110
twins are getting involved in technical
occupation

43
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,869
their is some their agree interesting
variation

44
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,999
for example of how he he

45
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,639
digest the number of women

46
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,479
board of elections

47
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,299
what's the percentage of women who are
humanity

48
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,569
eighty percent

49
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,429
ninety five percent of it

50
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:25,969
ratchet up a little bit more than that

51
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,280
is right around there

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,900
ninety eight ninety nine dependencies
soon

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,859
as a vehicle dominated by men

54
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,629
cluttered

55
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:39,840
government demand that men should be a
mentor needed there and what kinds of

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,739
articles that you thinks it's the same
kind of things turning on c_b_s_

57
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,290
what's happening to women who are trying
to get into this relatively

58
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,189
at least from what we understand it as
being at the male dominated feel bubble

59
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,180
lives

60
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,699
fared

61
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,919
will be done

62
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:02,009
home from the with the economy

63
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,889
and probably wouldn't be a little came
from

64
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,360
world's everybody it

65
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,969
the

66
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:13,779
can't we were flattened probably from
programs

67
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:14,899
reptilians

68
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:18,989
right that's a very dull but if you
think of that are the women to get a net

69
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,699
are they going to experience
differential treatment by the fact

70
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,609
occurred

71
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,229
so working modern history

72
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,619
into my mind so i don't see nearest you
mail this is for example

73
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:34,780
grounds and it's not known about mere
minority rule

74
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,009
the original pony industry

75
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:42,799
ambient they're not all now
predominantly on the facts they need

76
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,829
opposite

77
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:50,829
spends that they remember him regarding
the it university

78
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:02,549
we made sure that's the only one that
says the lord for traditional anybody

79
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,889
seems a little minimum his body and

80
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,449
reacting that

81
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:13,259
static but privately institutionalized
lately is the point where so

82
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,999
it's been said dont even know it for so
long

83
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,119
that with someone

84
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:20,609
for example so i had to do that with the
screen and the fact that you can see

85
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,900
that some of them

86
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,690
so requirements often since it was so
and yet we are seeking right press in

87
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,759
ninety seven percent seventy s are you
know so when you go by and i just

88
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,669
women's problems that you're women
stepped down

89
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:44,669
buildings

90
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,500
so they're very small version of your
total projected that his number with the

91
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,349
packers blueprint

92
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:56,250
that he's got a lot of women

93
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,090
without one

94
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:04,090
leonard your friendship

95
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,149
order of network

96
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,960
populism

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,699
you were talking earlier about how uh...

98
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,009
need her asking her

99
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,679
creek bed

100
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:23,069
oxygen pretty northampton bound

101
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,990
how much of that presidents

102
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,310
of being transfers actual grasp

103
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,819
so you're asking how many women are just
thinking it's going to happen verses now

104
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:37,280
that you could pose a question for the
women in the arts

105
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,150
who has been for us

106
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,600
they've been treated

107
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,759
i don't see ideas hired him down

108
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,430
boarding lodging there

109
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:55,150
sixteen games not neatly that she's the
one we might have after a hundred and

110
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,690
and and and and i i don't know how to do
not have the time to stop by

111
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,959
feeding etc

112
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,719
i started it

113
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:13,499
beginning an exercise yes that would

114
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:17,909
making quality entertainment

115
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,580
entered the room

116
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,289
community a_b_c_ news agencies
generalizing heliosmatheson you know we

117
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,110
don't look at

118
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,090
who's got a job in the fifties

119
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,749
and before that thousands of years meals
at the same vision design group

120
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:37,270
whether it's the truth

121
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,949
he equally based

122
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,889
he cannot be history

123
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:45,360
that goes with it and we don't

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,270
industries and beans

125
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,069
janet i said i'm going to happen

126
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,699
missiles that he he

127
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:00,370
a two instead to stop cubans are with us

128
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,860
i'm saying

129
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,439
and that the other hand i think

130
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,309
s

131
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:11,689
is that amended as soon as he did
something wrong

132
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,629
agriculture is something

133
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:16,349
unfair and he seems to be changed

134
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,470
that there is some

135
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,469
tacit

136
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,740
issue

137
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,769
and played it you will need to resolve

138
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:27,099
rather problems with this issue on the
serbs cigar boxes billion by asking if

139
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,849
it works out exactly

140
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,689
ramrod any co-sponsors of the work i
think is present you with the idea is

141
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:35,340
that

142
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,710
didn't throw out there

143
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,139
if we think about the fields thumbs up

144
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:40,389
traditionally male

145
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:43,949
if you think about the number of women
were critically important

146
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:45,809
as computer scientists

147
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,550
there's variations

148
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,229
three had sent

149
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:50,889
she was a student

150
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,369
very small percentage rate making less
money than that

151
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:58,339
we look at a previous sure here

152
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,219
uses

153
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:03,469
the number of employees computer systems
analysts male versus female

154
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:05,180
so

155
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,099
that's quite an interesting

156
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:10,199
broadcast specialist working it

157
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:16,599
so there's some of the obviously the
number of women are tracing

158
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,309
so is the number of men

159
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:26,309
so that is where they're getting into
this career is full of it

160
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,819
maybe you can

161
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:35,330
wine more

162
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,160
the sample

163
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,860
current there've been acb

164
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,120
i'm sort of back

165
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,410
one group of that

nearly four years

169
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,970
just walked in

170
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,470
does that suit

171
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,350
you think that would work

172
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,690
i think if you don't need to look at you
read expect

173

mhm

175
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,250
i was wrong

176
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:31,250
well not only because i wanted to work
but it's not like breakdown

177
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,300
have lost a lot

178
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,660
got final presbyterians

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,130
repurposed

180
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,160
do you have a look at this

181
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,710
but do you expect that

182
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,590
everywhere you go back and returns with

183
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,700
instead

184
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,790
this is a scientist i guess if there
were talking about top five

185
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,280
highlights and he said he did not want
one in the workplace at least rob

188
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,290
together some of them

189
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,050
was something i don't know exactly how
much money from people making

190
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,050
why is there a difference in in salary
deciding to draw attention to this and

191
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,600
myself a lot of technology

192
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,770
brian

193
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,090
i think it was that they don't take a
look and if i were thinking that you

194
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,290
feel

195
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,890
and in the state of texas into my
remarks along with the same people who

196
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,130
want to get them out

197
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,400
loaded

198
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,110
it's a very competitive situation
indicative of the mails if you go

199
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,480
something like that

200
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,320
influenced or something i would have
been created when you see what went on

201
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,140
and actually do it with didn't give them
as i said that he was a nod at ninety

202
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:52,960
miles an hour assisting institutions i
ascii statesmanlike

203
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,370
was one of the sky pending on bloomberg
personal ellsworth evenings at one

204
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,880
hundred thirty years is a lot more
sinister where situation

205
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,460
so i think

206
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,450
what becomes readily apparent as we're
going to listen is that there are

207
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,450
environmentally

208
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,380
i found that this is wrong

209
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,590
something that has a strong

210
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,130
we're going to be based on one side or
the other everybody knows something

211
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,790
about

212
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,730
summaries gathered sentences and tastes
great

213
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,820
i've been doing forums from love

214
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,439
we'll look at all of the points

215
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:30,450
these discussions are a rare will become
a it is very much like identifier

216
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,890
people get very pissed off very easily
whether they're on one side or the other

217
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,000
his everybody's going to be

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,410
it all the bills and that means of

219
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,600
what does that mean

220
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,770
well that means that they're is

221
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,900
subtitle a variation breast

222
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,210
in terms of important in terms of the
number of another person in the sticker

223
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,570
is the first

224
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,430
when we take that invites to simply
fourth

225
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,670
makes sense that

226
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,470
you know okay maybe there's less twenty
percent pure science

227
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,830
do you need a computer science breeze
you can contact

228
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,930
dvd any kind of formal training

229
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,110
no not really

230
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,520
so then barnett wanted by the definition

231
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,460
even if you were

232
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,680
even the way you define active involves
nothing malicious simply i don't

233
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,840
understand how this box works at its
most basic

234
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,480
the difference he would have been trying
to bring the people who just as easily

235
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,590
as me and get it

236
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:33,330
when we put that he had to dig research
on computer acting and some of the year

237
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,450
research by report

238
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,270
the computer underground for whatever
reason these mails dominick

239
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,079
in fact there are some authors from by
my research sociology criminology

240
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,510
a safe bet

241
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,050
since this debate team

242
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,740
agriculture

243
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,950
if you are trying to break it down

244
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,200
if it's not specific welts that what has
happened all that

245
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,640
about not

246
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,500
yeah

247
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,029
spiritual cereal

248
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:06,170
yeah i i don't care if you got a lot of
home runs by itself

249
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,490
and that right

250
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,000
male dominated

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,650
yes as one researcher but it puts it

252
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:18,660
hacker culture is like horticulture
where everybody's out there to be on one

253
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,360
another disabled how strong and the
bathtub brian

254
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,840
then maybe that's why would i thought

255
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,610
committee

256
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,870
when you look at it

257
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,690
reporters we're trying to understand
this

258
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,880
few women

259
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,939
that identified when there are a star

260
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,220
hard and fast methods

261
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,960
as one

262
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,190
restoring those

263
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,810
greta agar cracked out

264
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,590
it's discussion or comment was that
packing is a teenage male voyeurs

265
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,920
burrell our trip activity

266
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,450
you know i i i am female computer
interest anymore than you would find

267
00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:00,520
female waiters reassessment catching
glimpses of men's underwear now

268
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,480
i left

269
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,390
parcels opinion

270
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,370
if we can't find hard and fast numbers
about what

271
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:15,610
there are a few that senator grilling
her on the white hats off

272
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,720
risk of heart for it

273
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,950
if we ask the question for the
well-known actors

274
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,380

ambassador

278
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,220
basically correct

279
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,100
keratotomy expect one who brought down
the ikea guests apparently she was a

280
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,760
prostitute who at one point your life

281
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,810
as a professional aimed at many points
of agreement

282
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,030
advertising characteristics

283
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,600
are repressive

284
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,690
i'm a little bit of tobacco

285
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,069
nada

286
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:50,310
neighborhood

287
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,720
but i've got it

288
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,130
about these people enter which was later
on equality wondering about

289
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,630
here seven years

290
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,260
drawers a bit diana remember exactly

291
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,600
everywhere flat

292
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,920
pumped up

293
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,970
everything about the seventies

294
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,629
attacking government systems

295
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:12,500
recognizes that your eyes

296
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,589
she created to a lot of the electronic
distorts the intercom ok currently

297
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,490
and their whole mission was to try to
develop tools to

298
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,860
how on human rights and sort of cystic
applications in fact i think what we

299
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,080
call the hot

300
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,780
carpets of how

301
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,880
soviet partisans ended up with something
that i will call contact report was

302
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,900
called

303
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,200
contemporary

304
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,070
something non stop but i wanted to let

305
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,990
signed the military art and science
positive for drug

306
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,790
got something along those lines that's
the plan was what they are not the

307
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,270
answer

308
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,120
allover

309
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,470
she says this was

310
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,309
that back in the suspect that you can
use our website

311
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,289
with the gate

312
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:04,489
and they would try to prosper you said
you would be beating it was contemporary

313
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:10,730
art

314
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,650
always jettisoning

315
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,870
may be involved in which case

316
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,240
eating huh

317
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:26,130
your screen right india and involved
with the exchange rate

318
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,270
favorable that statement

319
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,050
bridging the gap

320
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:36,660
uh... currently too much better now than
oleanna

321
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,260
tourism here with that

322
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,639
blanket ruled out

323
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,319
because i want to know became developing
complex client

324
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,810
experience one senior member

325
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,300
uh...

326
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,250
thirty guys

327
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,730
so you know what a woman got pushed out
of you to be involved in some

328
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,190
i can't have a backpack

329
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,760
i came up with that

330
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,880
bessie that's very interesting point
because even in the open source

entirely west

432
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,560
we talk about general socialization

wherein there are certain roles that
women are expected to fill relative to

men

435
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,420
some people argue that technology has

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,710
it's analytical

437
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,980
it requires

438
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,890
skill to be operated and nothing else
there's no motion

439
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,120
when we think about that at least when
theorists talked about

440
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,630
things that come into play here

441

all of what you have to do in some cases
to make the system work

443
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,490
even argue on the other hand that women
are more sensitive

444
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,720

since what some people that are good

447
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,270
so as a consequence

448
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,270
researchers argue women if they're going
to happen when you have different skill

450
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:19,490
maybe they're going to be bypassed

451
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,230
there's going to be far best reverses

459
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:46,980
when we're together you get that day and
a warm front but

460
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,120
went on the other hand are going to be
more thought

461

ways to figure out

465
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,220
how to do so

466
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,570
i hate you

since most of your dad would say yes i'm
very much a hard mastery kind of person

468
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,729
that's all that

no u_s_a_ miramar alexandra deteriorated
when he concluded that we used

471
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,840
just like that prevent me if you can
pack between one

472
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,980
and you know

473
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,779
to the better

474
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,940
this practice workbook early eighties

475
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,940
work that was a socially acceptable to
be computers and the u_k_ should be

476
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,680
similar

477
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,610
unity between yourself this was a
promotional reasonable people like

478
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,700
from that day

479
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,890
december computer although that was the
front evenings

480
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,440
u_p_i_ was he didn't have friends so
keep your what your present that we

481
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,970
don't have to

482
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,240
so charcoal may have some products but
this time changes

483
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,500
technology becomes much more accepted

484
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,960
as almost everybody's got a system

485
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,810
edward your governor brothers and
sisters making airplanes videotaped all

486
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,890
the time

487
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,070
we have to take steps that the number of
women gave us is increasing ali

488
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,760
so experience as a baseline sort of
technology

489
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,610
easy to except

490
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,740
if that's the case then perhaps that

491
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,060
potential technology period

492
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,990
these

493
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,760
relevance of

494
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,440
not playing out here resonate more for
your young boys

pornographer

497
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,900
but it would be considered for

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,970
over the donald butler deeply felt
acceptable range

499
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,450
and what to do

500
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:37,700
advertising for example indicate the
specific thing i wanted to bring very

501
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,520
but i think they did

502
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,659
or you know if it's right off the bat
and artistic against the president and a

503
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:49,130
legally acceptable but we're glad of
that really

504
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,929
encouraging gap

505
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:52,770
successful

506
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,690
where i i certainly agree that once and
your border one-tenth marburg even but

507
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,840
he didn't even hotter hierarchy of
things obviously making stopping

508
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,979
that's a very good point because most of
the outages yesterday

509
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:06,840
that there is

510
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,650
one single life

511
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,090

easily he wants the other pple

513
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,550
whatever it takes to get what we get
done

514
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,820
there are also a structural art

515
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,380
both essentially that wouldn't have had
historically

516
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,559
more difficult

517
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,080
ways to get into the work

518
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,550
swimming arcane thinking very easily be
forced

519
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,650
about world war two

520
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,410
when in fact a reasonable in oversea i
think we have a member of the ground

521
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,860
floor literally delivered removing
demand

522
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,370
what's the best and that help though

523
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,840
whatever will happen

524
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,409
me navigation

525
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:52,660
debit wichita prepare for the well i
thought oh no no no i don't know

526
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,500
lacquered having been said

527
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,399
that's very interesting what his plan

528
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:01,770
workforce out factories once meant that

529
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,760
those kinds of opportunities disobey

530
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,220
so their kids variation in terms of the
ways that women to get into these jobs

531
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,190
under representation in computer science
technology all those jobs

532
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,520
if that process then

533
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,679
if undercover at

534
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,000
letterhead reading

535
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,500
the long-term site

536
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,480
gerber's package

537
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,080
beginning at three p

538
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,590
whereas the vocal required no mail
college-bound high school center

539
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,050
it will be made friends with him
reliable was you're the rosary esol

540
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:36,110
cooperative women's and men's rental
income return for ministry

541
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,710
so that is an action plan

542
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,050
now exactly

543
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,230
yet like ab

544
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,910
thank okay not me

545
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,110
traditional exorbitant ever meet did get
the exposure and

546
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,790
more and more penetrating exposed to it
like

547
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,050
utilities on etsy standards through
friend

548
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,200
and i hang around me not emails

549
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,450
actual some mikey frenzy i think that's
it for him

550
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,160
sloppymatt

551
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,960
closure will be

552
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,600
leading prime is just

553
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,120
hearing about hinting at

554
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,530
i have heard you know i'm

555
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,150
sketchy

556
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:26,150
very bright reconcile opportunities that
might be great

557
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,330
bob

558
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,640

role laptop

560
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,610
so stuck

561
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,030
and that may be something to think about
maybe in the future there's going to be

562
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,999
so unless the gender gap is that the f

563
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,120
you know

564
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,010
introduction of that out

565
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:48,139
these organs have been for dot one-way
these are just the idea is that

566
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:51,560
don't you think about that generally
who've been involved in this

567
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,760
female researchers

568
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,830
but the issue

569
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,410
they argued that the experience
allotment harassed

570
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,190
this is a bus that was a hundred out but
track

571
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,950
the river

572
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,780
uh... it was that lists that work

573
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,290
you bring us up your heart

574
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,440
reprimands or

575
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,740
bridge and it yes

576
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,559
out of the start of the earth

577
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,260
agrees it up

578
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,590
the separately

579
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:24,740
well you've got a lot do you know i can
expect to happen when we return

spouse was made

583
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,940
and it is essentially out of the area

584
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,200
that objects here sisters and brothers
not having taken a key date for young up

585
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,400
and out specifically for members of our
research and development team have

586
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,380
expressed continuously growing feelings
of affection towards riverton

587

or as one of our researchers put
heeheehee d

people living in the room experience
something simple

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,940
but not too distant great to be some
form of harassment

603
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:40,940
in every way back

604
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,970
this may be just a really good exactly

me base a fundraiser for breanna

626
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,630
so there's a raft baby experience a
little bit

627
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,210
primarily probably border

628

political at gop arrested

629
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,190
or sorts of objectification

630
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,350
and they are not the accident or tapes
the triple x

631

if you add up at a news release there
really are

634
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,850
come down here so i don't have a lot of
argument is that the quality validity

635
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,070
uneven

636
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,820
americans about the people

637
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,970

somaliland

639
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,820
yahoo net i don't want people who don't
have anything to do what i feel like i'm

640
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,220
watchdog but before he left

641
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,230

642
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,480
and a m

on the flip side boots

645
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,320
i think sometimes problem is

646
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,160
are working or profits

647
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,670
and there was such a problem between
with girls

648
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,330
men and women learn however it was a
that that what they would do if they

649
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,120
would have to be healthy realty

650
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,230
and uh... what i remember one time i
don't want total

651
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:44,070
to break even but mistake and delete her
but i'll tell you what you did

652
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,740
admits it

653
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,410
reminded also uses e-mail me

pass notable just as i can spell

655
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,499
yesterday and i've got a group of
trouble trouble edit

656
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:59,529
i mean i think i would just like silver

658
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,049
and also it

659
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,890
and i don't think that will be

660
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,020
unites up the star but i i can

661
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,030
more trouble

662
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,710
if description style

663
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,310
it's not

664
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,600
dictionary you know

665
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,530
but i have

666
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,700
actual and also some years but four
years ago

667
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,230
unsolicited enough

668
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,470
absent wide female knobs

669
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,770
so act in reliance on the leader

670
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,770
but she turned so great for and was

671
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:33,810
criminal or civil work and in this user

672
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,799
united flight

673
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:39,640
headed

674
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:46,010
sequestration almost passed out in our
hands around canon eos

675
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,770
detected by the end up at what are
called

676
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,260
or whatever

677
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,070
myself

678
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,899
voters dot net

679
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:58,090
divided i'd probably really which is a
lot

680
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,489
when trying to get well

681
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:03,259
in the process further research at the
bottom left-hand four

682
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:05,190
altman awaits us

683
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,400
so it could be an insider's taking
information from

684
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,168
drawing down brett

685
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:13,529
examined for trying to understand what
is the concept

686
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:17,219
and let the specifically look at
considered yet

687
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,470
either regarding

688
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,079
girls are checks

689
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,469
accelerated what have you

690
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,860
less than one percent

691
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,120
every threat although hosts

692
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,669
are really dealing with gender

693
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:33,669
so that tells us that perhaps this is
not a significant issue

694
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,219
concert

695
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,139
however

696
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,500
what it does come up

697
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,369
what is actually going on saying what

698
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:44,099
this first example this trough before
and this is what i got me thinking about

699
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,269
the whole thing

700
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:46,540
i got busted

701
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,760
topic uros

702
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,570
do you need who are really hackers no
one talks about the receipts and girl

703
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:56,290
who knows a lot of computers and acting
is there some real reason for which urls

704
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,799
you see these are some real

705
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,779
some girls which are at

706
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:01,239
the fear that it

707
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,130
desires are not mine either

708
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,849
directly from the press

709
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:09,839
scarce and only seen one girl could be
considered a hacker dental school ages

710
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:10,829
ago

711
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:14,479
give me a risky slesinger and
attractions hot

712
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:19,279
that lesson for julia dot manning at
shakespeare because they don't like this

713
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:21,239
to me

714
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:26,269
settlement comes on it since i have a
female actor and i know only a few other

715
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:27,689
female hackers

716
00:35:27,689 --> 00:35:30,299
there really isnt an issue that i know

717
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:31,339
so

718
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,200
become so i think the arizona senator
d'amato

719
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,359
then she said well this is still

720
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,649
chief of store that

721
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:42,780
another guy says i love it when it gets
cleared the area turns out it multiple

722
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:48,149
itself i

723
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:54,259
really accepted that is actually part of
me honest that generates anxiety

724
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:57,249
made this context at least of water

725
00:35:57,249 --> 00:36:00,559
and is that what happens all the time

726
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,279

732
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:41,629
well say you know there have to be more
or less for somewhere up in a circle

artillery attack

778

somebody says argue on your bed of roses

they had nothing to speak

783
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:10,229
breaks out somebody says that's a
relatively popular picture and all

784
00:39:10,229 --> 00:39:12,619
that's not yet

785
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,049
that's great sex sells all wrong

786
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,579
rather than

787
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,959
well black-on-black and so sorry i had a
i know what is really like this for all

788
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:26,359
of my pictures like everybody else

789
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:28,970
when something is update as well as

790
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,880
may take that as a cute

791
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,829
if there's a group picture of this kind
of the family name

792
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,579
maybe this is a girl

793
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,639
usually interacting

794
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:44,109
necessarily leads dot armstrong at its
yours flirting there's op responses

795
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:49,129
but nobody is specifically flanking on
your girl to be about

796
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:53,619
at a different threat from a different
forum along comes on and says well you

797
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:55,859
are several things that bother me

798
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,479
there aren't that many females and as
they are they don't make themselves

799
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:04,429
about second daughter to the post
basically spam or just pass for opinions

800
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:07,799
i took the life you know that there have
been other pieces of debris

801
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:10,769
great contributions it saddens me that
they don't

802
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:15,999
if you're female shows you how other
people who played in spam recipes

803
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:21,419
do something about it if you don't have
any printed your quit

804
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,879
very strong words vinyl

805
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,970
in response

806
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,490
couple people dot blots interview and
find it would really like that are very

807
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,249
talented

808
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:33,209
they don't seem to be more trip to the
start of the most liberal or

809
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:36,079
conservative emotional base things

810
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,499
intellectual that's why i think most
people interpolated by main street

811
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:40,189
london

812
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:43,409
reflecting some comments that have been
thinking about

813
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:46,510
i think it's very coptic girls in spirit
in half

814
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,380
girl same thing with the other

815
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,989
sax i don't think it really depends on
the sex of the person is just she's been

816
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:53,689
particularly unlucky

817
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:57,449
subplot to post is not necessarily
gender specific

818
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:00,339
at least in his first

819
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:04,739
versus a stereotype women into the ball
and it isn't going to help them don't

820
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:07,449

acceptable for the occasion

987
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:33,869
canceled an analytical

988

lycra

998
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,580
blame it on the internet but i thought

999
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,499
all late

1000
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:07,819
and that's that's why i would fight
battles of the planet

1001
00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:09,639
and i went out

1002
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:10,410

1003
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,660
rhamat seats

1008
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:25,569
tral

1009

1010
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:35,339
character of great help

1011
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:36,440
very interesting that way

1012
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,059
we'll go ahead and use the online
experience when we asked what is your

1013
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:41,329
definition of

there jess

1017
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:52,270
constantly and as we've seen in here so
far right

1018
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,149
bare-breasted mary

1019
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:55,499
there are similar to

1020
00:50:55,499 --> 00:50:59,159
when i was uh... hackers and missile
systems working out hierarchies and

1021
00:50:59,159 --> 00:50:59,930
people

1022
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,499
structures works

1023
00:51:01,499 --> 00:51:05,689
weaknesses of the ways independent
systems that have been overlooked

1024
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:07,999
and share the similar idea no

1025
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,399
uh... mario

1027
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,539
some people

1028
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:15,779
when we think about it

1029
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:17,749
definitional e they're insane

1030
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:21,239
when it comes to attitudes concerning
the legality

1031
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:23,879
men and women market very simple

1032
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:27,029
i don't think that that is not a
definition should be illegal is it's not

1033
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:30,269
intentionally but people should be
allowed to testify agrees with

1034
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:32,729

1038
00:51:39,939 --> 00:51:41,009
you might end

1039
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:44,089
um... you're hot wire so we need

1040
00:51:44,089 --> 00:51:47,259
i don't think it should be proud of
services that you can open it

1041
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,759
you can put names on these instead of

1042
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:50,690

real happy that's why why i drove the

1045

exceptional anything that they office is
being

1046

you always people get drunk acting

1047

premiums

1048
00:52:08,969 --> 00:52:12,380
so actively begin from purposefully
recreate them

1049
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,379
you don't ever do it on with it

1050
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:19,619

what about publishers that

1059

very very exciting

1060
00:52:43,009 --> 00:52:46,969
once that i think what i was wrong
depends on heart-to-heart damages the

1061
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:51,389
fact of how many people are pretty

when our country and they have a

1147
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,919
as a consequence of what we look at my
or brought

1148
00:57:11,919 --> 00:57:12,850
to understand

1149
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,129
how things work

1150
00:57:15,129 --> 00:57:18,640
there's very little of this and it's not
so much to say hello

1151
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,750
knackered bad that the other email
hackers or anything else it's just that

1152
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,669
at baseline understand

1153
00:57:24,669 --> 00:57:26,689
what the differences on our clientele

1154
00:57:26,689 --> 00:57:30,129
does this give us any insight into
hacker culture

1155
00:57:30,129 --> 00:57:31,140
how does this

1156
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:35,309
highlight any kind of uh... gender roles
socialization

1157
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:37,279
records offline

1158
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,549
building itself off

1159
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:41,959
unit at a bus

1160
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,419
primary level something that would be of
interest to the social sciences

1161
00:57:45,419 --> 00:57:48,239
such kind of what i've done with this is
not so much

1162
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:49,949
anything other than

1163
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:55,119
we have a certain live research in that
field what's going on and consider this

1164
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:56,170
so in

1165
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,139
are the entrance before

1166
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:00,619
it's success

1167
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:03,799
but it's not a anyone it's not cheap

1168
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:08,829
if there is when one hundred
ninety-eight jalgaon deja

1169
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:11,490
yes i know and i really don't

1170
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:12,660

1173
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:25,209
have read and at least

1174
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:26,399
k

1175
00:58:26,399 --> 00:58:28,939
hahaha activity in the last

1176
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:34,169
sexually than any other forum here in a
situation exposed to digits of your

1177
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:36,149
screen no we don't know

1178
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:38,799
generously

1179
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:45,499
para address on the senate where we
stand for long time and i thought that

1180
00:58:45,499 --> 00:58:50,269
was only three of us anything about it
for island hotspots i think there's a

1181
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:53,049
chance to talk to their placards and

1182
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:55,189
yenar ahes out

1183
00:58:55,189 --> 00:59:01,680
that and other offers the chance except
one who appeared to be

1184
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:08,249
hahahahaha vaibhavi

1185
00:59:08,249 --> 00:59:10,829
national grassland

1186
00:59:10,829 --> 00:59:15,429
let's cut right after graduation over
out there

1187
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:20,519
as a whole never message that interest
rates down to five hundred cultures

1188
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:25,819
or what's the definition of accolades
about packing up and his there's wrinkle

1189
00:59:25,819 --> 00:59:26,859
okay great

1190
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:28,069
but watson

1191
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:29,900
if they can share society

1192
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,149
weblog

1193
00:59:31,149 --> 00:59:34,220
because there is some variation in i
think you can call

1194
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,770
actors variation in actual experience

1195
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,299
chemistry works

1196
00:59:38,299 --> 00:59:40,489
so i can't say that as this room

1197
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:41,900
that every single one

1198
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,519
i can't say that every single female

1199
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:45,489
ads

1200
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:46,609
experience

1201
00:59:46,609 --> 00:59:48,079
gender harassment online

1202
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,650
intensive but it's not as bad as
effectively there may be some women out

1203
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:54,300
there to say i am so this top that up

1204
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,179
with the latest people treat me online

1205
00:59:56,179 --> 01:00:01,509
screw hackers dot that's great

1206
01:00:01,509 --> 01:00:03,210
correct anna sees a bit

1207
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:08,089
the reviewer used in the happy to say
what you did you don't need any research

1208
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:10,079
on whether religion rule

1209
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:15,169
uh... as opposed to regency one
contracting or or things like that the

1210
01:00:15,169 --> 01:00:19,859
city residents of predisposition
reported earlier their beloved today

1211
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:21,400
after the end

1212
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,079
because the research that's out there
economic acting doesn't

1213
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,559
there's a

1214
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,170
easter researchers georgann taylor that
tries

1215
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,189
let me say ask you if you know act

1216
01:00:32,189 --> 01:00:34,829
their discussion about female acting
though

1217
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:36,939
extremely so far

1218
01:00:36,939 --> 01:00:41,289
doesn't highlight their actual
experience are gaining but just says

1219
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,639
is very fine line

1220
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,279
things about it

1221
01:00:44,279 --> 01:00:48,789
entertainment in the activism is so as a
result organising

1222
01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:50,839
agnes package

1223
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:53,289
female cats

1224
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:56,459
confusing is that i have

1225
01:00:56,459 --> 01:01:03,459
hypothetically answer your question

1226
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:13,409
simple insisted there's a difference

1227
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:15,029
uh... right

1228
01:01:15,029 --> 01:01:17,859
twelfth but since then

1229
01:01:17,859 --> 01:01:20,109
procedures

1230
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,599
recital

01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:24,479
watkins

1232
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:28,439
with unparalleled diplomats

1233
01:01:28,439 --> 01:01:34,709
what i've seen is that priscilla charts
stage here

1234
01:01:34,709 --> 01:01:38,489
accident or women involved in the city

1235

encourage increased and exp

1237
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:43,539
so

1238
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,759
that they fix something

1239
01:01:45,759 --> 01:01:47,009
in terms of

1240
01:01:47,009 --> 01:01:48,299
women in

1241
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:49,789
getting involved in

1242
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,839
inspect speakers research that's
beginning

1243
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:57,199
stanford in a statement which is going
to break or about

1244
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,029
why is that there's this increases at
the open

1245
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:01,419
specific tasks

1246
01:02:01,419 --> 01:02:02,650
for a research

1247
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:03,609
pakistan eleven

1248
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:05,139
few things that up

1249
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,869
uh... at

1250
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:13,869
doesn't necessarily tell us too much
about

1251
01:02:14,389 --> 01:02:17,349
so bunnies characters that prisoners

1252
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:19,899
there against racism arrested but it's a
very low level
