we're using

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:06,150
then he said that he will be jails
sample mix-up at for a lot to me that's

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,080
worked

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,080
submittal understanding he has more

5
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,749
stands firm for inspiration recognition
in science and technology

00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:24,560
was founded by jean came in that

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,519
doubts and let you listen and be
informed and simple

8
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,859
really traditionally diabetic probably
have one

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,810
batman patented enough treatments

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,430
unfortunately all seniors only at that
time

krikalev huh

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,050
uh... so he can do this backing

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,420
nineteen

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,480
uh...

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,620
is stalled out when the students used
here

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,020
in some relief on program if you don't
know about it

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,070
explains that

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,180
u_s_ first working

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,179
then i_c_a_o_

20
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,670
you know as the first robotics
competition to something i'm involved in

21
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,189
the first lady lead which is for
elementary school kids pink blossoms

22

handout

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,590
in the first

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,299
challenge

25
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,200
which is the baskets at radio shack
which apparently did not so many more

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
simmons talking about the which is true

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,700
throughout but

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,070
they're on sale at radio shack been
achieved

29
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,850
if you can go by what they are also it's
pretty much the same thing i'm doing but

30
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,159
smaller

31
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,740
their over seventy thousand students
will line the mormons program if not

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,399
more

33
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,330
implantable you get back into the air

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,200
is the same conclusion

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,900
rosso nancy powerful plug

36
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,960
indictment at some point

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,700
buchanan

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,820
so whose starts the robotics season in
gambling is a season

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,510
people for starters

40
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,330
we have to

41
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,020
obviously there's no option

42
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,290
several other

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,819
plus the ten thousand dollars

44
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,810
the table spinning it out for what we
can put into the park spoilers

45
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,550
it's about three thousand five hundred
but that's leads electronics and the two

46
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,439
parts that go into the problem

47
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,159
would badass offer we get from companies
like organist

48
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,109
things like that

49
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:22,269
yet for the copy protection in the right

50
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,729
unless they actually just ten licenses
for inflicting or just me which

51
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,340
sponsored software

52
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,800
and they're interested in working here
but when living in the last three

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,779
anything

54
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:36,870
you went to the muscle ideal for more
important stand for

55
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,159
interests offer word

56
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,299
don't hurt by it

57
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:44,419
that sort of thing

58
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:47,249
a misconception that he will get it
might bring this thing out does that

59
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,150
sound we

60
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,699
it's really hard quickly looked like it
is iffy but he is

61
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,760
instrument

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,709
it's expensive

63
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,409
we have to teach new team members

64
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,099
uh... science math as well as it was
still in school science and products

65
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,089
which has been delayed

66
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,569
on its report

67
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,609
three strategy occurs

68
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:09,889
no it's actually a bungee his from all
across the nation states northgate

69
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,419

period for women

73
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,739
there's about three hundred isn't
reading classes about six percent school

74
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,889
there it's an interesting place to go to
school were installed

75
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,190
we stay on campus

76
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,090
at least first interesting bigger things
that happen

77
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,319
we are chaperone something wrong

78
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,229
so we have to teach only team members to
come in

79
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:39,819
harrowing wilson drivers vote

80
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,069
which clearly was not happy with it
that's not an excuse to find out

81
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,049
we had this one yet

82
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:48,179
who's one downgraded

83
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,889
prodi's first uh... this deadline

84
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,519
gay men are in one of the envelope so
bad but you know how to use two legs

85
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,399
anything he had been going seeking a
senior partner

86
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,049
ryan

87
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,559
yes you do this

88
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:07,129
teaching seminar in virginia the twenty
first

89
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,689
after teaching seminar

90
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:11,229
we actually

91
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:13,789
variously you can go to these different
sections

92
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,449
and was sessions scat

93
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:20,979
into the campaign learned part of and
generally the basics how to make it

94
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,629
box from it

95
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,709
spheres

96
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,190
just basic stuff

97
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,990
i came back because their own rights
computer

98
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,330
four months ryan was chatting with her
and engineer responses to the point of

99
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,029
view

100
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:41,449
and my job detained by the second year
by the time you got around to you

101
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,270
you need your

102
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,169
we'd all go awry entered the god of cat
no what are we gonna do with how you

103
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,020
will be a good week

104
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,099
distance m_i_t_

105
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,460
that says the thinking and nothing
making

106
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,469
let's forget nothing

107
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:55,960
there's a guerrillas past year

108
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,100
speaking girls and

109
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,849
this team

110
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:03,990
has been around for six years finally
only males captains ever

111
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,139
uh... so

112
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,710
that says something for the science
that's cool

113
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,150
calls moments from

114
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,870
my girlfriend actually step this past
year genetically

115
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,870
so no legal

116
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,120
set out for pre-season adoptive families
got the future

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,679
we usually get off of that they will be
avoided

118
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,469
so everywhere january

119
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,979
begins two parts we go to virginia

120
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,550
his virginia's local pickup wasteful

121
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,520
and rival bidder when its fuel parts
which is used for existing workers at

122
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,039
the pictures

123
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,599
their alleged cures thinking clearly
shows a sphere they should be given

124
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,099
ranting about students

125
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,519
engineering and it will all students
through global engineering unit bolivar

126
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,519
online industry much is the worst peter
world

127
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,319
soap they're like

128
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,529
here's a kid

129
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,559
is being planned you've got six weeks
for the walls

130
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,999
and the rules related legal document

131
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,120
rain is in their life

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,210
it's the worst for what you have to

133
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,860
eating is not able to sleep so there's
no doubt that

134
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,839
which and that's hardly

135
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,019
six weeks

136
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:21,569
high school students inductive

137
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,190
exactly

138
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,700
so we can use that in any structural and
he's vicarage

139
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,219
alliance matrimony

140
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,580
six weeks

141
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,599
as always offering reception

142
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:36,710
bentsen's

143
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:43,710
especially or something like this

144
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:45,600
and that's actually done it

145
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,259
injury studio pac's

146
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,799
which we also get a copy of the departs

147
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:50,669
activity like

148
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:55,349
performance up for companies that
neither ever really defect

149
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,910
simple yet it's actually a six-week all
her something chocolate with the state

150
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,450
this year the eighty nine cell it's six
weeks stop when did you know it produces

151
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,300
landmine issue that i mean this
companies had anything to do with him

152
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,330
condemning morrison

153
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,590
six weeks to do this we have all sorts
of problems during this had sworn here

154
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,889
we'd bring into this

155
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,449
called the motors

156
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,650
on the bond and you know you would think
six weeks not clinton's

157
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,529
sober is probably motors robot

158
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,460
where we go to transmissions together do
you suppose

159
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,489
dewalt manual eighty

160
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,169
boxes rollover

161
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,229
and

162
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:39,069
eighty

163
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,969
so his two brothers were power to you

164
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:45,339
in to deal with that is that my stroller

165
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,899
which is also used to part of your
account

166
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,080

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,880
it seems that with you

516
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,660

a change in the

519
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,039
because i walk into the case you'll see
one of these things

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,600
all these in his words yet we have all

oh along on faces

523
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:18,070
and that's the

524
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,660
present as opposed to having the
teenagers who are supposed to be working

525
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,040
without a clear understanding

526
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,470
reichstag work

527
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,100
yours on your part that i have about
eight active

528
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,210
you know you direction below the

529
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,080
your allowed to use

530
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,090
what parts advocate because those are
machine

531
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,750
unless it's a mother and you customize
to me

532
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,190
in the case of the

533
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,209
bob stroller us talking about earlier

534
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:48,310
any backtracked n suite four hundred
yards

535
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,159
went back to our were having matter word

536
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,299
so my questions and it's actually are
certain targets very or u_s_

537
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:58,070
but not necessarily awhile to get this
book

538
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,950
wildest blockbuster

539
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,060
uh... we actually disassembled and
planes in houston issue for them because

540
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,789
we

541
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:11,790
witnesses on this as a matter of allied

542
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,200
hahaha cited by ira how anyway

543
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,440
whatsoever

544
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,820
so you think

545
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,800
we take a look horrible guilt
understanding students were coming into

546
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,659
play with them

547
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:26,650
this is an exception because it's really
impressive about things like

548
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,260
saree said a lot of those

549
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:34,740
but if it were overbooking articles and
sort of using the same design refusal

550
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,430
era and all they're doing is
intellectually and that's that's really

551
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,320
good thing

552
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,670
uh... to use the same designs but the
game is very similar to yours

553
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,450
that you can police never ever see
disinclined to see changes on it is not

554
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,260
a lot of quietly

555
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,500
but it's not the same weeks what date
you really do need to keep things

556
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,840
thought to be interesting spans come in

557
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,820

00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,709
we use these chain gangs to keep these
things

821
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:14,539
the chain actually figured out where
procter gamble about that

822
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:21,539
on on the side there's no going back up
for a long years change in terms of

823
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:31,909
you know

824
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,819
hummingbird sonicview jock itch cream
and the reason the terrorists said it is

825
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:42,539
because they're going to run out between
a group of co-written back wheels and i

826
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:45,190
think once i was actually a m aids will
work

827
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:49,510
and that is because it gives us that to
release but i think it's my guess is

828
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,309
wind up on four wheels

829
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,239
meaning we stand attraction amazing
stuff

830
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,739
some teams use these things called on
the wheels which actually will point php

00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:47,049
this process

938
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:49,429
something like that yes indeed i don't
know what

939
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:56,429
pleading presage an article about that's
what we've been through

yes that's actually the question if you
are very mostly uniting bearing roads

941
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,489

never actually touches this chesi

944
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:14,179
it's actually just for starters baffling

945
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:17,769
so it goes directly to that and then
it's relies on those some of the reason

946
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:24,769
we didn't do that if we don't want that
baffling estimate for us

947
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:31,199
uh... they do but it was killed

948
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,299

because the city actually had others

956
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,359

competition

1147
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,220
it was really cool is that

1148
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,360
during that brief story page permaplans
greasy ideas the new over

1149
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,999
your competition

1150
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:15,489
polish wheat don't understand that what
we're doing what bro let's not make a

1151
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:20,739
non-citizens who feel that you see
designs that you don't continue to work

1152
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:23,270
with these other teams get to work for
us so

1153
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:25,319
it's really good

1154
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:28,179

1156
00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:31,069
with her

1157
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:32,860
their wallet is we couldn't

1158
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:36,039
wrote this year because we're too busy
posturing this piece of shit

1159
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:39,809
which evolves gives you don't get your
own but still piece should give you an

1160
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:40,579
example

1161
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:41,579
this horrible

1162
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:45,169
cost us our second compositions were
working on it and part time for the

1163
00:58:45,169 --> 00:58:46,140
recovery

1164
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,749
six weeks tight deadline

1165
00:58:50,749 --> 00:58:53,729
because of that we didn't have the
orphanage first and second compositions

1166
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:54,909
eh...

1167
00:58:54,909 --> 00:58:57,879
do it we should have this done but
personal vision

1168
00:58:57,879 --> 00:59:00,380
but still we had that problem to me that
this transmission

1169
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,349
working or middle we got work they did
not great but it works

1170
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:08,289
we won't allow this to be really low
classpath quickstep

1171
00:59:08,289 --> 00:59:11,079
both last night

1172
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:15,829
wind amazing human-like

1173
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:20,909
had been cancelled

1174
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:24,219
mostly from my belief is that we have
responded and i think this type of

1175
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:27,279
cancers adhesives predicted for tonight

1176
00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:29,969
among the elite are

1177
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:33,339
he has suggested that since there are
many when on enormous at nine hundred

1178
00:59:33,339 --> 00:59:36,199
two seven zero zero six

1179
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:41,009
here is that something that's not we're
only about one since the last three on

1180
00:59:41,009 --> 00:59:46,579
ads recently

1181
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:49,589
treaties because of that poem

1182
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:52,799
well obviously can't do it now because
that you're going to be removed

1183
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:57,200
uh... it's a dog shifter probably

1184
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,309
there was there was nothing on the link
their so that's actually what we have a

1185
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:05,339
nice

1186
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:06,390
that's going to do that

1187
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:07,700
piece of the whole thing

1188
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,930
no that schematic that's kind of
pneumatic walk which is actually

1189
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:13,619
supported by a darn block

1190
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,970
the door unlocked actually has a tap it

1191
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,209
uh... i don't remember the exact

1192
01:00:19,209 --> 01:00:21,359
uh... i've sent

1193
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,199
uh... some words half-brother

1194
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:24,039
the uh...

1195
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:25,520
hasn't guys actually have

1196
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,179
brands on sale we tap that no one wanted

1197
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:33,519
and recently did that was because
disguised himself asked three thousand

1198
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:34,920
when you're not sure if you have

1199
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,520
and wasted contestants

1200
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,490
putting it in

1201
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:38,969
and it wouldn't be here

1202
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:42,399
so would put the store and bought their
support that actually retrieval
