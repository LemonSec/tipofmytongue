00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,700
uh... databases for days

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,120
so because there's tools to do this in
you're walking through a lot of

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,830
different tools and just doing things
from the grandma perspective

and that's basically telling us look
into getting all the records that they

173
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,270

174

and i put in india dot com

175
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,120
among utility

176
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,260
anecdotes out more information
celebrated their they'll change servers

177
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,500
their own whose names needed to repair
the servers

178
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,250
ended

179
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:19,250
we are not bills arrive yet dresses and
includes may survive he dresses

180
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,420
and uh...

181
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,570
here trying to do a lump-sum transfer

182
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,610
so basically is on transfers to it

183
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,530
dr dot their entire d_m_s_ was used to
work

184
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,470
a lot more often than the old days
before

185
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,180
being as manufactures and smart

186
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,890
disabled some transfers by default

187
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,120
wanted implementations

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,660
burned down basically this with the
opening party an absolute uh... start

189
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,140
anna slipped up

190
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,480
and you do in dallas mine is deep on the
young domainname

191
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,470
and isn't that it was just want to say

192
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,100
today a lot of what they want some on
wall

193
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,370
mandel lifetimes which you get these

194
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,230
split in singapore with the impasse
because

195
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,980
they're running a terrible tenacity
every machine on the network

196
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,770
mitterrand something with it just public
reason missions

197
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:22,770
personnel were still getting tired him

198
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,650
in appears to have so dress for that

199
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,720
actually didnt work so it's a bit of a
lot of domain

200
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,390
motor spot or spread whippet

201
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,250
it analyst mind is the

202
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,150
and his own transfer were the difference
between them

203
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,930
regular um...

204
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,460
and that's what the amazon transfer

205
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,500
is the

206
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,390
as lookup

207
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,630
works on

208
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,820
uh... sent to you keep benedict

209
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,430
coz on transfer wilson

210
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,250
ccd fix what would be great

211
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,280
salon

212
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,510
more firewalls that

213
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,930
worry properly won't allow it ccp board
fifty three packet

214
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,330
interconnected

215
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,750
but may allow you deeply

216
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,860
salaam

217
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,149
so basically

218
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,090
editor so it's mother's day

219
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,560
and i get it done

220
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,300
indian certificate will change their
risks

221
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,260
and i didn't want to go along both
serves in any server sql server web

222
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,440
trends

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,720
mailto ewwww

224
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,200
so no one thirty p_m_

225
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,300
a lot of these are on the same address
which change is probably uh... virtual

226
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,460
ivy you can just content to different
forms

227
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:41,460
more than i did their own starved for
the record

228
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,050
years they uh...

229
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,570
another

230
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,110
and has looked up

231
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,350
all this while actually

232
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,310
before i don't see this

233
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,430
stream

234
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,750
uh... i think my ass a little and i got
her name server and i think the command

235
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,020
server space and the idea doesn't want
their nameservers

236
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,870
so i attach directly to their name
server

237
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,490
minute idea dot com and you gave me some
more information

238
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:18,490
from from their network

239
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,800
vietnam door actors

240
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,520
nameservers

241
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,180
along this system and goldie

242
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,290
if you just do it

243
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,190
doesn't run on windows live at all but
you can get version for windows both

244
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,690
foremost inconsistency exist by default

245
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,730
so that it did on the the way was that
indeed the indian names or at least

246
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,380
understand really didn't need any

247
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,900
that it gives them the absolutely loves

248
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,140
but then i just want to show this is a
different

249
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,740
split indians information

250
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,370
now initially what you can also do with
this logos

251
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,220
is you could discover uh...

252
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,440
on the main servers that these

253
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,090
reserved for us

254
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,260
misuse proves that nameserver

255
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,560
you'd be able to get

256
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,230
more information

257
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,190
we may need to do is on transfer
multiple

have

259
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:22,890

260
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,120
that wasn't around

261
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,770
information here

262
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,770
here is a good tool it's free

263
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,900
that'll allow you to do a lot of uh...
the same things anymore

264
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,810

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,040
inviting the jury indeed instruments

505
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:15,040
finds interesting information

506
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,260
and more information

507
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,120
thoroughly gasoline some information on
science votes actually get some more

508
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,990
information on a specific

509
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,450
five users

510
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,280
in due course change with the in math

511
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,169
mississippi command-line

512
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:33,820
um...

513
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,600
his idea graphs comes back tells me that
some of the next day

514
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,040
into that porsche got five uh... version

515
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,010
begins the up time really

516
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,879
which means

517
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:46,100
the times since it was left untouched

518
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,419
so millet

519
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:48,850
winnings to not four

520
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,580
and warm bility published forwarding

521
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,419
after

522
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:54,420
laudanum

523
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,230

524
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,390
even unshakeable

diversions

529
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:15,450
not one hundred percent below warm
service versions and so good expertise

530
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,340
it yours land mine challenge

531
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,890
you use the mandy

532
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,900
indeed

533
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,200
you don't have to really note all
flights or even been

534
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,580
process tends to be

535
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,540
long

536
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,100
so you can just

537
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,480
with the dogs for the truck touching you
want to do

538
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:42,220
did experts can you go

539
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,290
we're doing

540
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,520
they don't see any we can do skin with

541
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,890
forcefully

542
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,450
you know you can use misdirection or

543
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,250
unanimity

544
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,500
wholly different someone still

545
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:06,640
here's a look at the phrase for it

546
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,510
basically rob

547
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,180
v_i_p_s

548
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,820
um...

549
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,610
it it taste like these past two it was
source and destination

550
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,350
and it's conceivable sports

551
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,500
and personal

552
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,760
you'll french bread insight

553
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,860
be sourcing

554
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,510
destination map basically

555
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,639
loose cannon

556
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:31,049
on those boards

557
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:35,970
against that idea address into the
points incident myself

558
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,150
uh... so if barefoot

559
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,470
company has been intrusion prevention
system

560
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,150
and they detect you know you know
they're their customers

561
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,020
pinky scanner system and spoof one of
their customers and an intrusion

562
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,800
prevention systems is a little worried
that

563
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,010
gently networking want excesses you just
stop

564
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,260
those two entities doing business
together

565
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,950
but winded collectors want

566
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,040
predates way that attackers might did
things

567
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,760
also if you can manipulate

568
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,920
roundtables

569
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,120
did this information back

570
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:21,120
to students food editors

571
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,140
salah heart reports came into this

572
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,150
if you try it out

573
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,109
flesh out of network figure out what are
the pitch him

574
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,570
checkout building just

575
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,610

576
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,429

577
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:40,409
tribunals circulation details on all
those

578
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,630
reason i say all those is unknown

579
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,590
that name servers but there are there'll
be some other servers

580
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,370
there were only demands that dvd service

581
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,310

582
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,210

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,029

585
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:04,970
um...

586
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,139
indeed he still use

602
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,170
he said that in fact i think

603
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,309

648
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:01,240
uh... so you can enumerate systems their
the type of system you can see

649
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,139
is this going to buy issues

653
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,330

00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:48,360
i'm not sure source for the environment

662
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,350
i have a copy

663
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,330
uh...

664
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,690
you too

665
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:58,560

668
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,180
yeah also interrogate

669
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,720
uh... ports in the operating system
gives more information

in a few g_t_o_ they'll be menu option

770
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:41,929
so it depends on how you doing

771
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:45,450
tom here's a somewhat different

772

1188
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:55,489
that's the problem

1189
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:59,999
did so

1190
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:03,169
in a domain if you get one account

1191
01:04:03,169 --> 01:04:09,659
it can

1192
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:16,659
you don't mind

1193
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:26,679

1198
01:04:41,929 --> 01:04:46,369

01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:36,329
which workstations

1212

1213
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,339
workstation and server happy

1214
01:05:40,339 --> 01:05:44,579
one machine says

1215
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:47,289

1218
01:05:50,969 --> 01:05:56,930
you can use it to get mobile costly

to get it done

1230
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,939
get a copy from the

yes

1238
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:42,459
rectified it looks like the ones who
don't want it triggers that makes it but

1239
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,359

probably

1260
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,989
this is just

1261
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:29,449
in old example

1262
01:09:29,449 --> 01:09:33,859
it works

01:31:04,989 --> 01:31:09,789
software-as-a-service

1546
01:31:09,789 --> 01:31:15,179

1547
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:21,169
began attacking

1548
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:22,090
so out

1549
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:24,589
one technique

1554
01:31:36,779 --> 01:31:43,779
slipped a bit easier

1555
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:52,540
uh... firewall circumferential

1556
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,459
recently al

1557
01:31:54,459 --> 01:31:57,879
this is six point three

1558
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:00,379
modestly

1559
01:32:00,379 --> 01:32:02,609
it shows

1560
01:32:02,609 --> 01:32:06,000
firewalls

1561
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,659
export through

1562
01:32:08,659 --> 01:32:11,729
here's checkpoints

1563
01:32:11,729 --> 01:32:13,540
offal waft

1564
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,790
are so far also

1565
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:19,570
trap ought to ask for all

1566
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:26,570

01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:19,069
losses

1573
01:33:19,069 --> 01:33:26,069
the trace route

1574
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:35,179
borrows a lot of people

1575
01:33:35,179 --> 01:33:41,639
trace route

1576
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:47,560

1577
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:51,860
trace route

1578
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:54,940
uh... six house for the firewall

1579
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:56,619
trace route

1580
01:33:56,619 --> 01:33:59,539

1585
01:34:12,129 --> 01:34:15,570
three packets of it

01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:18,280
ulcer

1587
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,940
okay so

1588
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:23,419
the end of it thirty-four seven

1589
01:34:23,419 --> 01:34:24,480
trace route

1590
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,460
i speak thirty-four

1591
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,309
the target marketing

1592
01:34:28,309 --> 01:34:29,730
gets the firewall

1593
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:32,329
would be up for fifty-three

1594
01:34:32,329 --> 01:34:36,679
pass people out to be

1595
01:34:36,679 --> 01:34:40,940
the success of pros because it didn't
matter

1596
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:44,099
why is this command

1597
01:34:44,099 --> 01:34:46,739
access

1598
01:34:46,739 --> 01:34:49,409
viral would

1599
01:34:49,409 --> 01:34:50,639
this matter can be used

1600
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:51,639
force

1601
01:34:51,639 --> 01:34:52,749
protocols

1602
01:34:52,749 --> 01:34:57,770
are all filled

1603
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:59,129
the hearsay

1604
01:34:59,129 --> 01:35:00,209
paid their dues

1605
01:35:00,209 --> 01:35:04,199
far walk through

1606
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:07,189
you couldn't do that seconds himself

1607
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:08,030
basically

1608
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:08,940
firewall

1609
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:12,839

1610
01:35:12,839 --> 01:35:15,479
speed ccp by log

1611
01:35:15,479 --> 01:35:18,099
if i want the address

1612
01:35:18,099 --> 01:35:19,190
so basically

1613
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:22,029
firewall total part itself

1614
01:35:22,029 --> 01:35:24,479
the firewall

1615
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:26,069
at the entrance here

1616
01:35:26,069 --> 01:35:27,799
the target

1617
01:35:27,799 --> 01:35:29,489
inside of at work

1618
01:35:29,489 --> 01:35:31,109
absolute sheets

1619
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:33,250
faulty sick people

1620
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:36,609
on sorted out from behind

1621
01:35:36,609 --> 01:35:40,550
they could get responses received

1622
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:43,619

1623
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:48,300
u_p_s_ kansas whilst

1624
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,550
which is a lot

1625
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,999
it won't work gets

1626
01:35:50,999 --> 01:35:56,559
pure proxy baseball roles because
parties to for pakistan

1627
01:35:56,559 --> 01:35:58,119

1629
01:36:03,429 --> 01:36:04,989
you get that done

1633
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:17,169
why are all reversal

1634
01:36:17,169 --> 01:36:19,179
to there

1635
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:20,999
sponsor futility

1636
01:36:20,999 --> 01:36:22,389
and basically

1637
01:36:22,389 --> 01:36:28,909
we talked about the ccp handshake three
adverse impact and senac

1638
01:36:28,909 --> 01:36:32,669
most stands are based on trucks and

1639
01:36:32,669 --> 01:36:33,719
let's put it

1640
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:37,499
works to set up the session

1641
01:36:37,499 --> 01:36:39,329
and firewalls

1642
01:36:39,329 --> 01:36:41,739
blocking babson

1643
01:36:41,739 --> 01:36:43,389
allow act packets

1644
01:36:43,389 --> 01:36:45,209
because they assume

1645
01:36:45,209 --> 01:36:48,969
participate connection out to the saucer

1646
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:54,949
eniac packets comes back it's not impact

1647
01:36:54,949 --> 01:36:57,280
something that's just a minute

1648
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:00,550
to a session i guess pretty sick

1649
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:02,090
victor

1650
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:04,479
if you get if you have a parliament

1651
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:08,869
uses stateful

1652
01:37:08,869 --> 01:37:15,869
expects

1653
01:37:19,849 --> 01:37:21,829
so basically yes

1654
01:37:21,829 --> 01:37:24,329
wall you'd have to connect to the
machine

1655
01:37:24,329 --> 01:37:25,709
just using that

1656
01:37:25,709 --> 01:37:30,329
never have seen

1657
01:37:30,329 --> 01:37:32,690
you deliberately estrogen

1658
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:39,690
justified

1659
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:47,130
make this proxy mabel

1660
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:53,159

what's there

1667
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:28,219
certain generates a lot of packages

1668
01:38:28,219 --> 01:38:30,260
what's more taxes

david want to do this in nineteen
eighty-three rewarding

1683
01:39:31,879 --> 01:39:33,139
that still works today

1684
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:34,710
there's still plenty

1685
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:38,820
organizations

1686
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:44,059

1695
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:29,619
it's a lot of them are going to have a

1699
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:41,839
you find a lot darker

1700
01:40:41,839 --> 01:40:44,909
use whether in fact

1701
01:40:44,909 --> 01:40:51,909
here are just uh...
