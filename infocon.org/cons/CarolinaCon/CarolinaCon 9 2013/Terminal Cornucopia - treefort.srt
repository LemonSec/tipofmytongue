1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,640
right

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,980
so is a mentioned

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,010
my cornucopia by

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,010
what

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,660
how's that

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,890
the better okay I'll

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,590
if you're going to get a hold on me this
is how I'm on the Twitter

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,900
and with that added okay

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:48,460
and boy do I love me some America just
remember that

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,230
these moments I'm this research started

11
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,290
a couple years ago um well before that
it was if you wanna start from the very

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:56,980
beginning

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,920
i'd growing up and I guess my growing up
I mean

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,860
like the time I was born into like just
now I would

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,660
a be at Lowes or Home Depot or like in
the fabric store with my mom

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,440
and i win I would look around and think
if I had

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,729
in this place like zombies whatever like

18
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:21,369
what I do like way what I like stuff how
to defend its

19
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:25,509
were would be my you know my very self
attacks

20
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,880
things like that really like that's
kinda been a mindset mine

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,299
I'm his was born in El America

22
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,820
I'm so this research specifically start
next two years ago I was coming back

23
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,360
biggest Def Con million

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,049
and I was just thinking like really
interesting stuff here in this airport

25
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,150
probably make weapons and other stuff

26
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,540
just thinking couple years later

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,860
and a lot of airport later I'll I'm here

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,549
now so Mike this is a simple it's

29
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:03,619
items that are readily available for
purchase in an airport terminal can be

30
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,390
used to build

31
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:10,759
potentially dangerous weapon so how
would I go about proving this thesis

32
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,350
alright so I'm for 1b

33
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,200
we wanted to find a clear sky and I am
not a big fan of women things go

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,850
because it you know with it doesn't
really mean real-world Brett

35
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,220
generally but when you like an airport

36
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,950
you can't really look at like well

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,040
what can I get and it becomes a
completely different different question

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,690
much more difficult question forces and
I'm here now

39
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,320
with mister so I want to use only with
your

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,840
resource inside an airport terminal
after the security screening

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,600
and I didn't say I'm I'm I can walk in
with the

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,299
a travel approved multiple which

43
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,959
and its remake

44
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,560
what you could do Springer so

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,270
yes so what adisq what am I not gonna
talk about

46
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,290
here we're not gonna look at the
psychology of hostile takeovers

47
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,740
mostly because like with the human
element like

48
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,080
you can have someone with limited
resources but you know above-average

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,060
intelligence

50
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,370
very effective really is gonna look at
the stuff that you can

51
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,000
have occurred we're not gonna look at
smuggling and prohibited I'm because

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,390
thats

53
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,970
completely different question I mean if
you can get things and

54
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,330
mean make a questionably bill so we're
not going to consider found object

55
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,200
what I mean by found objects seen these
around

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,820
in an airport I'm pretty sure neither
honey pot

57
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,260
because they leave around I like

58
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,230
like in my mind I'm seeing screen with a
vengeance

59
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,970
sweaty guys standing around it like grab
the comet grab this free bottle

60
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,430
one take you want to but I mean
seriously

61
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,360
a lot of interesting things here like
I'm pretty sure that comment something

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,730
really

63
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,860
a trash bag things like that so

64
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,989
there's a great dream engine

65
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,390
there's a black bag for like banging
yourself once you take great bring

66
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:31,390
here many I was actually hoping love you
tell me with that

67
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,820
I have no I thought I sign into the
little

68
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:46,820
thing and nothing happened I don't have
any drinks okay

69
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,130
this is a human excised by spring

70
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,420
and it comes with the chain built-in so

71
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,570
here is that I

72
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,860
warlike now

73
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,920
okay sir i think is an airport people
watching

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,340
things you that's all notice right they
would be like

75
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,950
crap as a Jan right thing missing but
every single store in that place is

76
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,700
going to be stuck behind the counter

77
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,880
and a lot of people America

78
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,720
um the berliners these things now you
know if you if you open this door

79
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,110
an alarm to go off and people come out
and see but

80
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,130
you sit around long enough and i sat
around long

81
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,650
the occasionally they will buy these
medical

82
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,000
carts right stricter little

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,490
got these loosely on the back

84
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,230
walking you could probably snack that

85
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,950
okay what else we're not gonna talk
about aircraft

86
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,850
her abilities like United toilet twice
what was

87
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,910
Dixie like a cruise ship just stop
somewhere

88
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,630
and like Christmas is cancelled good job

89
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:08,630
talk about the effectiveness specific
government

90
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,090
because I wanna see that's the kind I
think minor child

91
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,860
and minor child wants the bill weapons

92
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,930
okay so to make weapons have to know
generally what we're going to do it

93
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,199
and I think basic because these these
are really basic so

94
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,240
water basic attack an airplane okay so
you want to injure people

95
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,270
sometimes the death so there's that

96
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,759
cause panic and I don't just mean like

97
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,590
you know for the heck people do this in
reality in

98
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,009
called probing you do the

99
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,259
the like I think

100
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:50,430
and musicians from for

101
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,820
country sort they were on an airplane
like

102
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,910
that fasten seatbelt sign they all stood
up for the walk

103
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,229
they definitely a half hour

104
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,520
and so people search freaking out I mean
if you can only imagine

105
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,520
so they did that to see like what people
like ours in the bathroom so

106
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:14,970
something else you wanna do is identify
and disarm the Marshall

107
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,259
funny

108
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:23,440
yeah I

109
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,080
against the glass to recover the Holy
Grail so most people are trying to you

110
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,979
get in the cockpit

111
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:34,979
they're trying to damage here but those
two are really tough break because

112
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,300
post-9/11

113
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,310
people okay so

114
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,800
I wanna make weapons and stuff right um

115
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,000
I I wanted to do a little research into
makeshift weapon so I

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,430
I started looking around necessities
invention small

117
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,180
and so I looked into prison right so
like that's one place for you

118
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,070
have limited resources and hurt people
and

119
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,969
this is actually a

120
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:07,740
was made in prison real used

121
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,849
ground masthead and

122
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:15,370
this was actually used in a successful K
and it was fired

123
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,750
during the in the last

124
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,400
they were messing around but isn't the
major occurring across

125
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,969
filament actually the

126
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:31,740
power the match knuckle duster

127
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,940
it's made from looks like having

128
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,510
me for the rain

129
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,440
right so because getting this before

130
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,089
use but you can obviously

131
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:51,839
also to pry double

132
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,350
sex

133
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,580
very it also used

134
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,860
mass met so I'd

135
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,360
like weapon

136
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,220
the hash

137
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,329
but I I thought it was interesting and
some people were lovers not fighters

138
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,699
here's a whip with

139
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:24,699
a counter sink in reasonably a crucifix
you

140
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,759
which looks more like a prop from a
movie but

141
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,839
um spring right that's like ninety-eight
percent

142
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:39,040
presence notable exceptions shit like

143
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,519
basic math work this out so you take

144
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:49,180
anything harder than skin

145
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,790
and you raise that to appoint and UN d

146
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,190
him you gotta share

147
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,370
so if here think I'm still waiting to
hear back from the

148
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:09,370
nobel peace prize committee happens so I
looked in the fall

149
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,750
the post-apocalyptic world because they
have a lot of makeshift weaponry there

150
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,880
this cat yes

151
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,970
he's carrying missile

152
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,810
how to love to

153
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,600
hugh missile a look at these guys

154
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,010
it done their fair share weaponry over
the years

155
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,600
so top I look into this

156
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,579
got a very nice structure

157
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:46,660
they talk a lot about cell the
fundamentals so

158
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,070
what other people that like real-world
right

159
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,410
Europe got back issue yes

160
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,170
okay she bop

161
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,540
I think he's GPAT used

162
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,140
traditional use process tried use or
something

163
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,649
so this is this is pretty clever right

164
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,350
his way so this guy

165
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,220
he decided having these it wasn't quite
quite close

166
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,810
his crotch so he put it and

167
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,000
he also failed with these things so

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,450
this guy well and the cutter

169
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,550
and looks like a bird now alright so

170
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,350
what XO

171
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,220
what makes a weapon like let's talk
about just the little bits

172
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,730
because if your gonna make weapons you
can sold

173
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,620
Malay for more than one is a melee you
want something with good way

174
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,110
good balance I link is definitely a plus

175
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,830
to get up someone's real durability is
wonderful

176
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,830
if he's got an edge to it this point
right you get those

177
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,470
so examples be like a club staff and the
award

178
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,860
ace Chuck sore neck there

179
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,950
the pros to

180
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,510
melee weapons other simple builder girl

181
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,330
like failed their

182
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:28,330
with northern

183
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,600
was very low time so the car

184
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,279
that every time

185
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,589
you must be in close proximity you're
tired right

186
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:48,350
and again effective want me weapons

187
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,220
in the bigger and really hard to attack

188
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,790
surprise so you tended airplane with the
giant bat

189
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,949
walking toward you and if you don't you
probably shouldn't work there

190
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,690
so what ranged weapon so what we need is
in some kinda

191
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,949
energy source right so that could be
like

192
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:12,029
traction spear could

193
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,910
expansion yes like aspirin stick

194
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,170
like

195
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,180
lever tradition electricity

196
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,880
so I'm what you need is a channel
projectile name

197
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,170
someone yourself a projectile

198
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,990
and something into your so example would
be like a spear

199
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,149
playing slingshot limbo a blog on

200
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:42,089
Boehner or crossbow contribute your

201
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:49,089
which we can

202
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,100
Bros right

203
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,010
the tax are less overall motion probably
be in your seat still

204
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,380
better

205
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,269
control think because people or here the
next right and also that range

206
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,500
he said

207
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,610
anymore part lot more difficult to
construct time

208
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,000
and up

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,310
so flexible flexible

210
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,440
links strong durable material

211
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,950
and bonus points for spikes for sure so

212
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,079
think tional graduated for

213
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,670
so this season

214
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,050
they are terrified the conferees

215
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,209
nearly impossible is airplane and you're
going to take

216
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:45,300
and your India these are all these are a
big problem

217
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,730
so it i cant

218
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,060
reaction that causes very rapid
energetic expansion right

219
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,480
and in some cases you need a container
that would rather not

220
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,820
have its rapidly contracting materials

221
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,880
X painter I'm your sins

222
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,290
so expansion

223
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:13,320
reaction tree something that so

224
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,510
I'm otherwise you might have height just

225
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:23,019
because the prince free rosaria

226
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,339
right so i'm used

227
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,820
version if it smaller damage on a grand
scale

228
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,490
condor extremely difficult the side

229
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,930
source if you do manage to find one I
think pretty difficult

230
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,720
night just based on history there less
flammable materials which

231
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,079
available require a lot more oxygen
reliever

232
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,180
an issue other things

233
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,680
or electricity so thing like teaser

234
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,120
regions diversions are

235
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,180
the region's like in prison people often
make

236
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,199
station attack

237
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,220
are many kinds overcast or otherwise
plane

238
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,709
that's bad news also fire the

239
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,930
I thought about drinks

240
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,660
also so what's next

241
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,100
let's identify the material to do this

242
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,110
which hit

243
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,649
Gloria JFK national

244
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:38,690
are you right around the corner his
international America

245
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,029
and so I process doing a sinister

246
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:49,029
tons and tons stores their times and
thunderstorms but like

247
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,680
if you distill it down is only just a
couple Heights right so you got like

248
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,440
overpriced

249
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,709
store which I so in here you might find

250
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:03,430
drinks plastic candy

251
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,610
the counter medication powder

252
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:12,510
their disposable razors lost and

253
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,540
letters magazine bunches right power
adapters

254
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,220
Malik things here and there this years
are interesting because you get little

255
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,780
die-cast airplanes things like that and
you might like

256

duty-free which is

257
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,500

rollers this

282
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,960
overpriced sports like I'd

283
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,540
higher bills golf balls novelty helmets

284
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,960
many basketball so

285
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,870
really interesting this really varies
depending on your

286
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,300
location here the most

287
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,379
like this

288
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,200
him stuff

289
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,200
giant crystal pointy things have to

290
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,780
rocks giant rocks free

291
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,400
Hannah Montana frisbee side rock hang

292
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,630
which that's a half

293
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,140
very sad man you by surprise

294
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,260
like medals over here

295
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,670
glass Boyle mister

296
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,410
ever so here's mecca

297
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,300
this is where you

298
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,320
fine

299
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,170
okay the following list are all things
that I'd

300
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,700
sir interesting

301
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,840
like die-cast airplane taking the money
will file

302
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,260
down here Axe body spray baby powder

303
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,450
unfortunately this is not cornstarch be
baby

304
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:07,230
the tell based Co

305
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,400
and disposable cameras disposable razors

306
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,640
external USB battery in

307
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,640
diameter last here you

308
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:34,460
that just happened

309
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,609
so at all full other basically really
hard

310
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:41,099
here think Lysol spray

311
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,710
shot buyer

312
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,710
alright so that's right to build

313
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,599
so before the bill I want you guys to
keep in mind

314
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,809
like all these are like first Mar

315
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:58,989
0.1 right so

316
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:03,049
this is me sitting down thinking like
I'd like to build and then trying

317
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:06,539
one-time so that said

318
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,629
like effectiveness in these particular
is

319
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,029
at a certain level but all these can be
scaled

320
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:17,950
very very easily using things

321
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,749
same thing overall I would say

322
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:26,759
I probably looked at maybe twenty
percent

323
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:32,859
or Spain we're going to do this

324
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:37,460
family bathrooms are nice locks got

325
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,979
cover toys power water make

326
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:47,979
you know workbench nice well

327
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,779
get into the bill okay so

328
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,080
one I a double wall tumbler 0

329
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,249
quick and so these are the exact things
that I you

330
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,309
right but can be house while

331
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,599
have so double wall tumbler

332
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:08,509
here air bike used

333
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:11,749
different litres

334
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:15,469
and want to thank you dual

335
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:18,940
right and so up

336
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,139
we gotta a little ride Sherman to
appoint and

337
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:27,320
a bit of a cop companies are visible
you're going couple

338
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,200
and really look at isadore the only
reason I included this

339
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,919
in testing like like this week someone's
neck

340
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,019
free pretty her

341
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,389
like I don't know if you wanna

342
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:47,070
thank really you much this right

343
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,649
so on a test there's no idea

344
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:59,649
definitely a

345
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:07,119
a

346
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:13,649
hell apso

347
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:17,440
so that happen yep so build number two
in that

348
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,019
that I think you scale naturally by just
making parts bigger

349
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:24,279
have your and having a good set along
helps

350
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,080
drug problem um

351
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,119
to build number two I magazine

352
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,179
leading Liberty fridge magnet

353
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,519
very pointy braided leather belts
actually ended up

354
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,169
on unraveling take

355
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:52,169
you it's the charts at liberty

356
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,580
so are so I rolled up these magazines I
use

357
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,460
scotch tape lot state things as possible

358
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,580
Iran a strand a couple friends leather
leather

359
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,670
the middle and I obviously a residents
LaShawn

360
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:21,670
all the ladies as well not at all

361
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,350
what's happening right now art

362
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:40,350
so area

363
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,309
okay did anyone see where

364
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:56,309
wrong we need an engineer

365
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,780
I really was like

366
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,780
back Tollywood on that clip from like
the Internet thousand years ago

367
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,690
Chuck back space your best friend

368
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,110
still drunk in school okay

369
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,120
ISO

370
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,410
so it first you don't succeed so I'll

371
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,860
melon frame much harder target like
which is

372
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,179
arguably more humans

373
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:35,510
smaller so it kinda weird and

374
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,090
issue there was I didn't use real
leather belt I bought like them

375
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,559
and the expensive side just

376
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,120
just a little tougher than install so
round two

377
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,120
I use a lot of strength

378
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,210
oh hey i'd

379
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:12,210
trucks delivering we're

380
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,660
and do their be all the help

381
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,670
so pretty hard are

382
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:29,680
so OK

383
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,460
a good byproduct other said the ladies I
I really wish they were middle but they

384
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,350
weren't there like them composite your

385
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,050
hit right on but it's like an added
bonus like

386
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:45,910
break all in whatever you hit is creepy
they're all over the floor and their

387
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,330
looks like

388
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,970
bill number three

389
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,570
I a hair dryer compression sock

390
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,930
brillo actually shafting

391
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,100
umbrellas real quick are like the

392
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,200
I there too to airports what

393
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,070
buffalo or native Americans used every
part I mean it's like

394
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,080
i cud

395
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,360
got a pendulum and it's like

396
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,350
it's like a small portable full
mechanical pieces that fit together well

397
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,490
right so are integrated leather belts

398
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:29,490
condoms

399
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:37,470
and they gave me Planned Parenthood this
is planned Parenthood

400
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,170
this is a sling bow know if you guys are
familiar with the term sling

401
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,660
like child between

402
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,050
like a the mix between so

403
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,060
small basically

404
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,750
used his friends will too everything
together and also to

405
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,770
LaShawn II

406
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,990
kinda rated tried hi we work at times
together

407
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,470
it's like herding cats

408
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,670
and then trying to put condoms

409
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:22,670
you

410
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,100
for %uh some early Sat so right back

411
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,260
and I use the strip compression hosiery

412
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,120
the option but I i won fiberglass did
not hear

413
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,100
and I love you guys ever like mister
terrible

414
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,640
with gnarly you know up billions

415
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,100
splinters likes you look at a long
enough and it's tough getting your skin

416
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:56,100
and you can get it out isn't visible

417
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:02,809
all

418
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:03,400
so OK

419
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,290
a quick with that like I use three
columns on each side

420
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,760
like when you use this thing I'm
probably ramp that maybe 45 right

421
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,090
and I could become a lot lot more
powerful also use

422
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:21,800
better so build number five a robot
Robert Young

423
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,920
ship

424
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,030
in exile in magazines ambrose are using
the spoke to them

425
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,130
stay dental floss double

426
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,790
number luggage handle what they give you

427
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:42,150
occurs

428
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,160
which is internet for crossbow in and in
case

429
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,880
as wondering what the luggage handle
doing yes that would be your class

430
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,880
stock the

431
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:06,520
right dude

432
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,049
basically what we've got is

433
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:13,190
ribs the umbrella kind of to the tennis
thing

434
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,440
amusing string which lacks great

435
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,710
like want to roll it stays together row

436
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,950
waxy row ban

437
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,970
particular I'm using the the river well
as the projectiles well

438
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,710
ideally have your something middle but
this work just fine

439
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,730
a man of course tying it all together
with the

440
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,090
the trick for me

441
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,410
essentially a piece of metal out

442
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,380
luggage handle age that just can't

443
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,380
and as you rotate trigger

444
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,380
releases the ring which releases a rare

445
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:58,380
strike

446
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,640
art again like

447
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,450
horse killings I will probably use five
or six the

448
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,060
a lot harder it's your bill 6

449
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,270
AXA magazines sketched a loss

450
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:25,270
the Constitution shy loves

451
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,600
heights

452
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,010
this is a metal sure

453
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,260
they had mislabeled on a shelf is
actually just and metal spike

454
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:43,050
for hurting people that's why

455
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,710
though when you put all that together
see

456
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,760
you end up with America

457
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,760
and that is in fact the spec

458
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,620
at a lot heavier than it should be so
how to build this

459
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:11,950
old magazines

460
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,700
if you reinforce that with a lot of cast
a

461
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,679
and braided leather belts and a lot of

462
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:23,779
loss which works surprisingly well

463
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:30,779
I wanna watch that again

464
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:45,220
you know it's funny

465
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:50,159
because first think the first thing I
tried the first family

466
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,159
his work II assumptions obviously

467
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,970
I was a little surprised help how

468
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,480
bill number seven actually from one

469
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,870
at liners little liars

470
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:10,780
yes they sell yes you can buy home

471
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,320
a parrot ar.drone my case I had
different little

472
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,609
thing stay

473
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:22,819
and that got me this and

474
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:29,819
here

475
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:37,659
laMere this is it getting cuddly with
the transmitter

476
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,429
basically this is I'm using the will

477
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:45,679
I've got that hooked up directly to the
Brussels Motor

478
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,109
and that is resting on the

479
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:52,789
from a disposable lighter Springs so

480
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:55,999
basically what you get is really really

481
00:34:55,999 --> 00:35:02,999
changes later it works pretty well

482
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,830
K

483
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,900
at the flight was basically

484
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,570
gone at this point like third

485
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:37,150
their usual sparked but it was pretty
quickly

486
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:41,360
turns out him important note from

487
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,400
last film I was using receiver and
transmitter that

488
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,640
communicate side one

489
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,990
celebrex that you control

490
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:58,990
your smartphone

491
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,230
its ad hoc yes so

492

boxes looks like about 500 pages

497
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,380
benign whole which is I

498

given so

527
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,460
number one an attack cockpit

528
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,780

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:10,930
for long periods of time ally relay

533
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,150
you wait for the

534
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:21,150
the pilot commands politics other

535
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,940
ranged weapon from incapacity

536
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,420
them just after the opening or creating
just a few seconds

537
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,770
her panic and usually when

538
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,720
when this happened and I'm seen this
happen i'd

539
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,750
in training um

540
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,450
what'll kinda your area a beverage cart

so can't

542
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:54,010
anyways with a given time

543
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,220
you could or so processes here is like

544
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,760
keep them from being able to shop or
right person

545
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,710
way is preoccupied with a row are

546
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,920
so number two

547
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,560
was a seat from the plane such a bagful

548
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,100
serial mister paper along with one other

549
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,370
him playing detonators a place that bad

550
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,650
overhead and

551
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,760
upon triggering it your smartphone it
would catch fire

552
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,830
course and would write back

553
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,630
that fire and all the while you Curia

554
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,620
and you'd

555
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,000
find the plan airplane on the other side
of that you know what that is

556
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,350
it says here in case of emergency

557
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,770
it's like the sauce there so

558
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,220
probably have really heavy

559
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:00,450
supports intention up

560
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,700
3 after bakal cereals

561
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,780
along with later places it tomorrow

562
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,290
what oxygen masks

563
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:14,400
deployed and option makes things really
well so

564
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,660
attacker cut the oxygen line place is a
secondary donator

565
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,720
in the oral cavity from with the past

566
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,380
go somewhere else half

567
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,490
as my contact information doing it on
time
