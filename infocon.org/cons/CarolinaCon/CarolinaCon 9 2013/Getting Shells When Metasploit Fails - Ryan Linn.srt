1
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:47,590
okay is a better okay

2
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,440
so and Ryan

3
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,640
just about me really talking about Tom
what happens

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,339
when hollow we try to use Metasploit and
then things don't go well

5
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:01,960
so arm miss weitz open doesn't or by

6
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,979
arm AV is getting better stuff so

7
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,690
gonna are figure out how to deuce maybe
bypass in some other way I see it sells

8
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,289
when they dispose just not doing so arm

9
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:18,720
why do is mess wit are 24 from investing
it's got a lot of models with it

10
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,149
arm trooper result it's a lot of things
including

11
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,259
getting pieces of data memory very
easily are many companies are aware of

12
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:26,670
this

13
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,950
and even Metasploit is generally

14
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,819
are mostly a white hat or it turns out
that or APT one uses it to

15
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:38,600
so I guess of I guess maybe that's
important to pick up

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,229
arm but we still on Shell's and since
pt1 a successful we should be to

17
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,890
arm so what we do and arm hopefully if
you're interested in that

18
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,970
your in the right place to find out so

19
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,300
we're gonna talk for a minute about what
Metasploit emitter are

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,649
and then we're going to talk about
including people its review vision

21
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:01,099
arm how many people here views one yet
see

22
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:04,520
or SMB when the ANC okay

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,149
good so arm couple people and this is
like one other tools to use all the time

24
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,290
so talk about that with about the same
going eighty are Mexican Grill is a

25
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,769
memory

26
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,780
and also just game sells their single
server arm

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,730
so this is pretty much all gonna be
hands on the house and some stuff is

28
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,080
going to work on some stuff isn't

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,700
so arm I'm ok kinda shows or

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,739
the traditional like how you progress
through levels of frustration and we

31
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:31,780
finally say screw it

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,129
him just start the doing the things that
are most effective

33
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:40,200
and pass them along promises you sort of
have to do this for

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,560
each individual test that you go on
Center IP's changes you go from

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,970
just a test so you can just build winter

36
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,460
arm so for those that are familiar

37
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,650
which if you don't know by then and like
this

38
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,680
conference you're probably in trouble
but the summits was a pen testing us

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,819
with a free market and the reason that

40
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:05,120
is a framework as something for
everybody so sys admins lots of tools in

41
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,040
there to help them

42
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,800
find out whether or not then honorable
there's of eggs or east of which does

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,510
everything from scanning animation

44
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,970
there's also at many things in there so
arm for instance if you wanna

45
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,120
setup I'm TFTP client stuff like that

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,300
there's all that sort of stuff in sorry
exploit is obviously

47
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,970
home thanks and then post models hope
you get it off the system sorry thing

48
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,500
from

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,140
dumping memory processes dumping ashes a
list of

50
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,500
arm interpreters special itself

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,670
arm it used to just be when does the

52
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,319
so report it for some other platforms
was cool about it is it

53
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,650
uses the low injection and so arm

54
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,209
a lot of cases when you're using the
trooper there's no actual files

55
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,459
land on the system so you don't have to
worry about cleaning stuff up

56
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,530
and so we're actually gonna look at this
arm sir Michael's and Esther is never to

57
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,520
leave anything behind

58
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,819
so I'm gonna talk was in different ways
to do that

59
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,170
arm also it allows for again

60
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,520
traffic routing stuff like that so if
you wanna ever from one hour to the next

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,220
and if you did anything with the CTF

62
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,540
you know some other stuff will be
hopeful for for things like getting to

63
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,080
the scanner

64
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,760
so the main things that

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,410
we're going to bother him as a pillow
arm

66
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,180
which generates payloads my seven code
which encodes them

67
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,310
an f-bomb you saw mass of

68
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,389
you know the m7 code is one of the
things that you mention

69
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,449
also you px is a a packer are it tracks
down binaries

70
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,069
and it turns out that work sometimes
that's and Africa by AV

71
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,220
if so arm you px is getting picked up
more places now

72
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,259
but one of the things that I do with my
tools if they get picked up by

73
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,849
AB first I will you be expected and then
they won't so

74
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:54,569
arm work some that their the second so

75
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,870
I'm also going to talk about using
shares arm and one of the nice things

76
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,599
about that

77
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,430
is you don't have to worry about
actually a budding bromance

78
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,520
so arm one of the things I've been doing
a lot more often is generating scripts

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,100
to go from box to box to

80
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,600
to get rid of them and so this way you
can generate a script instead of having

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,139
to worry about

82
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,000
uploader I think avoiding things you can
reference your own share

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,949
and just run commands against box after
box reference and files that are on your

84
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:21,520
share

85
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,169
you can even if you feel brave make it
right all so that you can log everything

86
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,030
back there

87
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,130
and you never actually have to really
pay that much attention what's going on

88
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,480
om so it's also easy

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,160
play sex or bust of so this successfully
sent

90
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,660
any place in an hour arm so Bruno

91
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,150
that just a second so the the first
thing I'm wanted to talk about

92
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,240
was arm

93
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,260
for small getting access to systems so

94
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,699
com

95
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,750
so for a lot of the test that I'm

96
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,510
been going on lately used to be a couple
years ago that anytime you landed on a

97
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,770
network you're guaranteed to see him as
a way to 67 yr

98
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,010
maybe even some stuff back 2003 arm that
was lying around

99
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,190
and more more networks now that they've
been through more pain to us

100
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,350
arm are having addition all

101
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,030
arm resources put into things like in
trouble body scanning

102
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,290
sourcing more more areas were
configuration weaknesses

103
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,479
are the primary impact than and stuff
exploits

104
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,820
so one other things I wanted to shake
this first is responder

105
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,930
which has become part of the for arsenal
that we use for a lot of our intro and

106
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,820
to us

107
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,780
and the goals responder is leveraging
arm two different protocols

108
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,479
the wonders uses to help resolve names

109
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,220
and these are on by the fall and most
environments and one is some

110
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,930
no buyers name resolution and so
basically what happens is if you

111
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,340
search for host name that doesn't exist
on a first checked

112
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,259
DNS and DNS although I don't know about
that and so then

113
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,000
will go back and look at your local
network and sent out a broadcast and say

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,530
hey

115
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,180
but I got this and it turns out that
anybody on your network an answer that

116
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,470
whether it's theirs or not so we sort of
like

117
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,380
were very friendly and if somebody uses
I'm looking for something that doesn't

118
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,139
exist

119
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,500
well I K I hope you're ok with that come
see what I got so

120
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,780
arm we we do this for both annette BIOS

121
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,229
and for on your protocol which is the
link

122
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,449
local multi casting in resolution arm

123
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,900
which basically arms and adult even
broader audience

124
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,479
so basically responders going to is
we're gonna set it up

125
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,970
and for anybody that put on at this
request up to the network

126
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,210
written answer it and then because we're
on the same local network

127
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,430
as as the our target is

128
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,759
ven the go ahead and send us there

129
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,900
and so on B-two hashes which weekend
then crack to turn back and knees while

130
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,979
passwords

131
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:57,060
so the way this normally works and and
test as we start of

132
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,360
we one responder we get hash week racket
and I'll use that to log into a resource

133
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,620
so com gonna city into responded rectory

134
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,780
so responders on get up on and so

135
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,449
users responder you can just get on it
and it works great by the fall

136
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:20,449
and and backtrack so we look at our IP
address

137
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:28,840
and whispers fire IP address

138
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,610
and so is as everything's running so
this is gonna run

139
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,990
SMB server a sequel server a web server
and so basically is people are searching

140
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,079
for things using

141
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,589
everything from arm FTP to

142
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,069
try to find wondershare when they look
for something on the network and they

143
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:44,949
come to us

144
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:48,310
we try to have something that can answer
them and that they can type credentials

145
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,730
into

146
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,470
so arm are some pretty conversational

147
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:02,470
thanks probably not

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
no it's not thank you

149
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:26,529
Sivak August sorry about that

150
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,839
so om now in should be good will get
better when this box

151
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,839
and

152
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,440
love the love

153
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,449
so now try to connect to something that

154
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:59,449
doesn't exist so

155
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,180
try to make the Loar says permission
denied

156
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,350
back to hear we can see that there's now

157
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,230
ash so this is not the user

158
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:17,230
so we'll look into the right user

159
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:27,010
up with the backup free later

160
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,709
let's try this one this month

161
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:41,709
hopefully nevermind there should be no
password so I think we're good

162
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:49,120
let's try that again re:

163
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,949
so for missus night again okay

164
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:56,649
says better demo one user so week up
your password

165
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:03,480
and then we can use

166
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,480
John

167
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,970
and so the super secure password is 1 so
now

168
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,790
without actually having to compromise
machine a password for

169
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,050
so nixon we want to do is

170
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,190
arm how many people use the PS exec om

171
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,529
much or the Metasploit okay says no one
that I use all the time

172
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:36,529
so okay

173
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,360
I terms of the people crappy divers

174
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,410
you don't really have to try real hard
arm

175
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,470
like so usually from a time when I start
this up there's a combination all

176
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,819
so arm a couple things go on one is
people run scripts

177
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,619
services on machines and then never
update them so they're still looking for

178
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,129
that server that existed back

179
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:01,639
like 92 and so course hopefully is not
on the north anymore

180
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,679
arm but sometimes they are arm and so

181
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,259
when they try to go to to that box it
doesn't exist so it'll send up the

182
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:12,329
broadcast in law answer it arm also but
all

183
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:15,699
the servers so they've switched from its
mandate McAfee

184
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,929
and so now the prices are actually going
up looking for

185
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:23,019
AV updates are mostly and actually see a
bunch of those

186
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:28,119
and so we pretend to be the AB server
and and I'll just give us their houses

187
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:31,509
own bull

188
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:34,600
that would obviously be a great next
level recommend that to the gaza

189
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,759
responders to just pass the AB
signatures for those things that are

190
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,269
searching

191
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,499
of that be a great AB bypass

192
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:46,779
so I did

193
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:52,350
our own but I can try to weep so

194
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,410
that's the bad part so

195
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,100
a really for the most part people people
will come to you

196
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,189
and from the time that I run this on the
network it takes anywhere from

197
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:08,670
like under a second to maybe five
minutes for people to start making typos

198
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,529
and so what are the times I bring this
up on doing other stuff

199
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,889
I tend to first thing when I do when I'm
star and does this all start listening

200
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:16,749
on the local network

201
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:20,309
just to see what broadcast protocols for
their and what sort of stuff is there if

202
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:20,869
I see

203
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:24,399
at least a couple arm no bias packets

204
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,929
go by a startup respond right away and
then one doing for scans or other stuff

205
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,059
this will be running in the background
like pink red sand one actually

206
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:36,019
ready to start packing stuff it's there
so

207
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,730
arm PS exact arm

208
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,809
takes basically remote host the demand

209
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,299
username and password so come back over
here

210
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:51,199
demo one demo one and this will tell you
where I got it from

211
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,220
someone into 168 192 150

212
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,220
out yes or no figure

213
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,340
it's all the demos alive um so there's
going to be a mess up so you can enjoy

214
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,200
them with me

215
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,540
home so then from here we won a
specifier matter for payload

216
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,540
and we specify

217
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,529
r.i.p for a host

218
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:37,029
and exploit and so this is gonna fail
okay

219
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,430
so username password was successful by

220
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,459
that is for sock so obviously we

221
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:46,509
were in trouble here so we know this

222
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,860
arm so we can try to do a couple things
om whether things that war

223
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,959
work on some systems is turning off a V
so PS exact is still usually pretty

224
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,970
reliable for this sort of stuff so let's
let's take a look

225
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,970
using this for PS exact so for us to be
win

226
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:10,730
yet see on backtrack we can copy the
pastor this

227
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,319
and we specifier user as demo 1

228
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:18,040
and then the percent sign the password
om

229
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:24,649
and for here we want to the system and
uninstall and so the reason we do system

230
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,649
and uninstall

231
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:29,350
system obviously want all the privileges
if we can since this is gonna be running

232
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,749
as a service it's better off that we
just go ahead ask away through that

233
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:36,079
but we also wanted to uninstall when we
leave

234
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,779
and the reason we want to uninstall when
we leave is because

235
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,990
arm our goal is again not leave anything
around so

236
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,180
and so here we go back

237
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,559
and do think those three

238
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,149
and meant

239
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:59,089
see so now we have a Comanchero so now
we can do

240
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,370
other stuff so one of the things that
spent a lot of time with his

241
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,790
when this man show so there's a much
different way so the process is one

242
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,639
is a Sikh weary to look the services
that are running

243
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,670
so we want to look to see here what type

244
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:19,439
he is in use so we can use find

245
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,949
and so is using Microsoft and I'm our
service so

246
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,779
we can do seek weary and we can go back
up

247
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,100
we can find the an hour service under

248
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,660
its so

249
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:42,089
okay we can try to kill this we can see
how that goes there's no backspace

250
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:47,790
so your have really bad typer

251
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,800
so OK those for fail so

252
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,360
we can also look at the task list and
see if we can find

253
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,589
arm a task that we can kill so

254
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,860
let's go ahead and to you W my see

255
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,730
process list and %uh we might see
process list will give us for path to

256
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,500
the processes

257
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,619
so we wanted to look for say Microsoft
stuff be easy to do

258
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:17,620
we can take so

259
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,549
we can see microsoft windows enterprise
here

260
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:29,549
mom so let's try

261
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,210
okay

262
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,179
so there's a fine process that we just
used we also see arguments that are

263
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:45,870
passed to it

264
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,620
so we can see here that we have

265
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,090
a Microsoft Security Essentials process

266
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,429
so we'll go ahead and look at that alcee

267
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:00,760
kill it so

268
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:07,500
you do

269
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,200
so that works was try again and then if
that doesn't work we'll try another one

270
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,250
okay

271
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,280
so that wasn't the one so you come back
and we can look for other processes

272
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,580
and so this is sometimes effective and
sometimes not but for a lot of

273
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,580
devices for a census indec as long as
there's no two pieces to it pretty easy

274
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,240
to kill

275
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,460
AVG also pretty easy to kill I'm usually
when you see stuff we're going to the

276
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,100
operating system with more prosper

277
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:42,100
up products together the harder so

278
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,630
balance the nine that is actual scanning
engine and so

279
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,020
that didn't work so let's look at some
other options for things that we can do

280
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,800
so

281
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,330
arm we can try to mom

282
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,830
in code stuff which will one coat stuff
and they're going to use

283
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,680
a encryptor to critical heparin and

284
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,960
what this will do is actually uses a
random key

285
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,990
and we'll use that rain and key to
encrypt it

286
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,870
and actually brute force is that he won
it once so does a couple things

287
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,250
om if you remember from from Matt stop
one of the things we talked about it

288
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,090
adding a loop

289
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,610
to slow stuff down increases a vision by

290
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,540
doing the decryption at all so as to
more time so it doesn't actually see

291
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,670
that stuff my om but

292
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,170
again this is something else that right
now is not being picked up

293
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,090
but it may be picked up in the future so
we right now this is effective

294
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,000
we'll see how effective it is and a
couple months so

295
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
what's work on going ahead and in
creating about

296
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,830
so we want to use them as a filler and

297
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:03,060
create a Windows interpreter reverse TCP

298
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,160
we need a sitter almost to our IP
address

299
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,280
enero por

300
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,590
to a good apart which

301
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,430
always 8675 on because that's the number
twenty calls on

302
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,930
om answering to make this role

303
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,430
and we're gonna pass this to myself good
s-type

304
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,480
XE and redirect this to

305
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,650
myself see so

306
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,140
second time code basically this uses the

307
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,280
Chicago I awesome that was talking about
the sky and eyes

308
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,460
om the default coder so we're trying
coating it will see

309
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,760
sometimes this will end up being enough
to have a TV sometimes it doesn't so

310
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,430
we're going to do is we're gonna move

311
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,450
the myself to put on my stuff and hard
up dub

312
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,360
and that way I can either have a web
server or also set up summer

313
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,650
om export the same directory

314
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,990
and so that way when I files there if I
need to fashion via the web

315
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,990
I confession web work on it on the S&P I
can do that as well

316
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,020
but basically I come down here and the
some work on file

317
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,170
and I copy the the printer arm

318
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,870
convict so here you see

319
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,440
the the printers and so basically
created something that would just about

320
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,300
exactly like it

321
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,420
so up passes for a dub dub its Prospal

322
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,800
read-only and guest okay so will start
up summer

323
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,040
and then we can come back to your cell

324
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,600
and next we need to do is start

325
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,600
a a listener and modestly so

326
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,409
and so now it's that are almost there up
for on a set a couple other things

327
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:14,399
we want to set arm the exam session

328
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,240
false and that means that this will keep
running in the background as more

329
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,120
sessions command

330
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,000
basically we can have as many ominous
voice lessons as we want them again

331
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,110
and so than me exposed SJ

332
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,080
to start in the background so now we
have a listener for stuff to come back

333
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,419
in

334
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:38,419
so we come back here and

335
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:54,380
so try to run as an access is denied so

336
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,010
arm from here we have a couple other
things we could do

337
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,870
we can use other templates but whether
things that has been

338
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,570
iPhone pretty effective is using the
high rental to encrypt it

339
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,140
so om weekend do wine

340
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Iberian be

341
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:35,360
risk

342
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:54,690
this

343
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,659
let's go back into the

344
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:08,659
directory

345
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,020
this better

346
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,990
so now we have handcrafted on much over

347
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:33,990
buyer so we come back in here

348
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,270
so we see that he completed here we go
back to Metasploit

349
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,790
seasoning stage

350
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,370
answer now interpreter session so we
were able to

351
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,820
evade the by going through hands

352
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,780
I'm pretty not and turns out it's pretty
successful so

353
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,870
when the things that we want to do for
love these is arm

354
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,150
actually once they looted migrate out so

355
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,500
another we can set is that it migrate
when it's finished

356
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:14,500
so

357
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,560
so when txt like I said arm we can do
this will pass the house

358
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,570
as well so another way that we use this

359
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,780
is once you actually gonna box and you
do have some we will get through

360
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,730
will grab the administrator password and
how many people have use Medusa before

361
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,010
okay some induces an awesome tool
basically

362
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,570
which you do is you can give it a hash
it will try that hash against

363
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,590
large numbers a boxes so once we
compromise one box will take the local

364
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,620
administrator password

365
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,700
well companies we use the same
administrator password on every

366
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,130
workstation so use may do so will go
through all figure out which machines

367
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,880
that'll work on

368
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,290
will go back and we'll use when ANC and
will launch our

369
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,060
ominously alone against all those boxes
so officials will come in

370
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,840
then from there we can do things like
mom said on Iran's

371
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,070
and and Metasploit to run a series of
different

372
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,120
a series of different scripts on them so
we can do things like automatically

373
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,800
impasses

374
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,490
armed and that sort of stuff directly
from their already talked about that

375
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,920
so its key pillars in memory sows
sometimes

376
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,150
we just had problems with this just is
to art

377
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,140
so when the things that we can do is we
can use promotional code exec

378
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,730
which will let us run the stuff directly
from memory so the Metaswitch shoko

379
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,560
isn't actually ever on disk so to do
that we're going to use arm

380
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,640
talk a shocker exact which will be
called a CE

381
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,040
30 tonight XE and so the only thing or
maybe catch us in this case is if you

382
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,630
have

383
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,300
a network a/v component if you have a
network a/v component om

384
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,410
as mentioned his talk with the things
that you can do

385
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,780
as an able stage in current which will
stop that

386
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,780
so let's take a look at that one

387
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:12,179
so I already have a seat at 32 don't yet
see here and so

388
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,769
what we're gonna do is we're going to
use

389
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,799
as a pillow payload and

390
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,340
we're going to do for CCP again

391
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,509
we miss our for

392
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:30,100
back to you is 675 are a host

393
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:36,830
to

394
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,750
dear all we're gonna go ahead and use
the same

395
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,350
my second quarter and we're going to use
the offer mixed in Qatar for this

396
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,670
so what this is going to do is basically
give us

397
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,400
%uh alphanumeric string and so the often
cutter is useful for a couple different

398
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,010
places

399
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,120
one is if you doing FTP exploits
obviously

400
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,230
there's a knowles new ones all that sort
of stuff

401
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,710
is really important and FTP cuz it you
know it's things like

402
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,630
are and man and so alpha characters

403
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:12,630
or a lot streets

404
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,950
so the a fun is really useful for the
sort of things

405
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,840
but also if you need p.m. shoko from
want men to another

406
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,530
it also makes it easy for that so here
we have a sitter so good that we can use

407
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:48,530
so copy this to make here

408
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:02,909
and here we have server session back so

409
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,010
by executing through memory we can get
past maybe

410
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,770
oh so also for reference the target that
we're working on

411
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,270
is 127 box that I accidentally updated
this morning

412
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,260
arm with a Security Essentials there was
also acted

413
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,140
did it this morning so on this is today
is AB signatures in today's packages

414
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,890
that were

415
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,549
home with so in case you're curious
about

416
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:30,080
how what practical is actually is arm

417
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,640
so as a right now arm Microsoft Security
Essentials is actually also one of the

418
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,429
tougher ones

419
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:39,179
to get mine a lot of situations they're
really good job picking stuff up

420
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,520
so a lot of the stuff Justin coding
matter

421
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,380
will be sufficient and some of them you
actually have to go through and easily

422
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:46,980
strikes

423
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,500
so many other things on into to talk
about

424
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,960
was getting chills through SQL so

425
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,539
coming people who mess around with mom
the

426
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:01,159
I XP can show and

427
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,809
MSSQL okay so there's a couple

428
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:07,830
so I'll one is awesome

429
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:13,000
arm they thought that one of the things
you really need in a database was the

430
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,650
ability to execute commands

431
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,289
so this is been for for ever they have
thought that this is a good plan and

432
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,559
it's still there I guess

433
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,820
his you don't want your dumb stuff to
still be like

434
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,169
that not be backward compatible arm so

435
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:31,309
on to make sure that everybody can still
be done stuff XP command shell is

436
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:36,010
is still and om my the latest Microsoft
the course and so this is going to be

437
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,809
the latest

438
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:40,900
sickle Server Express an XP peak man
show let you

439
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,669
shall commence now by the fall is
disabled but luckily through

440
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:48,740
OMSI construction week can re enable it
so

441
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,780
like for

442
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,700
for external to us this is especially
handy unless you actually delete the

443
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,409
deal

444
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:00,010
just turning it off is insufficient so
true love the external

445
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,580
us that we do when we find sequence
action it's easy enough just to turn it

446
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,169
back on

447
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:08,110
and then we can do you things like down
my binary answer run commands on

448
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,600
the web servers behalf which is also why

449
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,070
you are on the civil service behalf
which is also why you never want to run

450
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,000
your Siebel Server

451
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,100
is system which they've gotten better
about that but some people like no

452
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,850
that's

453
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,169
we should fix that that's different from
the last version so you're copying and

454
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:26,350
pasting your configs from other like
broken crap

455
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,210
make sure that you update them so that
they're using stronger permissions then

456
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,809
old stuff was using so winnie is this
text cute

457
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,950
are pulitzer XP command shell and are we
can also use this

458
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,820
arm to determine the same see commands
so one of the things that

459
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,830
that you may want to do is pull yourself
up a list of your favorite

460
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,669
a AB's that you can disable and then
basically you can

461
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:53,309
those monies commands arm and ball and
try to get with a review this way

462
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:57,280
so arm since

463
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,450
this is sort of talking about a little
bit about modestly arm

464
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,289
one %uh the things a mess with as an it
is a a sequel client so

465
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:08,809
we're going to assume that we have
gotten somebody to give us a password

466
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:09,600
the responder

467
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,919
for sequel and so we now have a password
to the database

468
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,250
I said this would also work over
sequence action so

469
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,280
this work on it a number of different
ways so

470
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,169
when he is the Ox admin a sequel

471
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:28,750
arm SQL command and so

472
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,750
we are going to set are

473
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:39,720
our hosts you and was figure out

474
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,720
what port that is on box

475
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,040
so the amount that a one of the things
that one is also nice about

476
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,290
is telling you for sickle servers that
are started what Porter on

477
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:04,210
so the dash a command for and map
doesn't show you all the ports on a box

478
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,890
it only shows you the most common ports
someone other things to take no

479
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,370
is just because you can't see that
there's a sequel for open

480
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,850
pay attention to your the scripts that
run as part of a nap

481
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,620
arm the indices will often tell you
where the sequel servers

482
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:26,620
even if you you want to wear

483
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,409
so that all things like but

484
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:40,409
I'm energy

485
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,530
okay

486
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,690
so in case you also didn't know it
there's a history File

487
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:04,080
in your diet himself or directory so we
can just copy all the stuff over

488
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,419
and use it here with the one difference
be-

489
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:12,980
that

490
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,649
so here and that's not the right address

491
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,850
so we have our our house at your
password set

492
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:28,850
are I essay we wanted to see whether or
not this works

493
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,779
fail

494
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:41,779
year

495
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,520
so that again okay so now we have that

496
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,500
so with the things that I've also done
is how many people here views resource

497
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,070
files

498
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,440
for this way so resource files are also
very handy

499
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,540
so I created to once call disable its
peak Mansell

500
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:06,050
which basically is this it you want
enable

501
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:12,670
XP man self so

502
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,540
of the things that we have to do we have
to run as be configured should be its

503
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,130
options

504
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,390
run reconfigure enable its peak Mansell
reconfigure

505
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,420
and then at the end I can think to make
sure it works

506
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,080
so back in Metasploit summary directory

507
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,950
and you and it will speak Mansell

508
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:41,339
you know run through man at the end
agency

509
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,130
IP address tough so those affected were
able to turn on their

510
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:49,560
and so then from here I have to do is
that the SQL statement

511
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:56,560
to you

512
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,440
0 yeah does other one arm back spaces
are the backslashes

513
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,900
are escape characters and so we need to
make sure that we have enough for them

514
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,700
to do the right thing so you actually
double up on them here for

515
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,180
everything you do and

516
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:30,180
apparently still not enough

517
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,140
yet probably

518
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,330
our live demos awesome

519
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,320
so still not there

520
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,320
0 that's why

521
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:09,440
but with first time

522
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,230
nothing to see here

523
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,319
so anyway take better than me

524
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:25,530
that's the key here so now

525
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,700
we should see stayed sending and so now
we were able to run

526
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,700
are UNC path over sequel so

527
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,119
arm all the time I've been seeing people
starting to move it towards

528
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,799
arm disabling SMB because they're tired
and Busters popping stuff the SMB

529
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:44,589
but luckily like when you have heavy
debt workshops everybody apparently need

530
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:45,089
sequel

531
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:48,569
stop so is everybody BC on their desktop
any

532
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:52,690
pic universally crappy passwords across
applications so

533
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,390
arm bull I'll see a lot now where I end
up going through this

534
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,720
and and manage to to compromise loss
machines

535
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,160
there's equal so one other things is is
obviously we don't want to leave a

536
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,720
broken

537
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,420
arm since we we just made it less secure
so the

538
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,440
other script that I wrote for the other
half this

539
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,440
om is this a way speak man show which
basically does the exact same

540
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,819
thing we did before in reverse to make
sure that

541
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:30,359
it's actually of so and so we see at the
bottom

542
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,869
that actually failed the fun

543
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:40,869
so

544
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:49,690
was going to be one see fun

545
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:57,459
of go ask it was passed the House so

546
00:38:57,459 --> 00:39:04,459
Wintec with ease

547
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,029
so we can run the Tom

548
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:15,029
first one does gather

549
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:18,809
I'm smart ass now which will get us

550
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:25,779
the the actual houses from this box so

551
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:29,359
sometimes we'll see where we have user
that has

552
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,609
om word advance credentials arm

553
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:37,089
the is on the same box or these are the
really good the box on as an admin

554
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:42,779
user on every box if due to a chief

555
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:46,489
so our own

556
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:49,489
one of the things we want to do here as
we can use

557
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:53,529
say user to one user will copy their
last year

558
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:58,589
and

559
00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:03,880
for when XE we can set

560
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,919
the SMB hash to be that hash

561
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:10,559
and so now since we don't actually have
to know what the username and password

562
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:10,929
is

563
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:13,989
we can actually use SMB om

564
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:19,089
does anyone exact we put anything 12 for
the password

565
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:24,519
and with

566
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:27,880
oh yah units as hard arms

567
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,369
was expert answered two setting that's
better

568
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:37,359
so now you actually are and or system on
a box

569
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,929
so om another tool that I wanted to get
about

570
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:44,849
many people use to set up so do Sequenom

571
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:48,429
arm actually appeared and apt 1 report
as well

572
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:51,829
because apparently the Chinese know it
alls into but

573
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:55,319
arm what it will do is it will actually
give you some %uh them

574
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,269
credentials are remembering so home have

575
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:04,689
think it's still it is part OVA

576
00:41:04,689 --> 00:41:08,809
it is not open source but it is freely
available

577
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:15,809
so

578
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:28,119
so here we have the sect om so arm I
will usually copy just like Tom

579
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,989
because I can type very well to just %uh
txt

580
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,759
all UPS that up because it helps with
the evasion

581
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:42,759
and then

582
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,290
so we see a couple things here arm

583
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,740
we see all the houses that we have for
seeking get all your pictures and

584
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,660
arm but it will also show you different
things from

585
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,440
so if you have credentials at half-staff
in memory

586
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,630
it will list them here but this is one
of the cool parts so if you have

587
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,370
passwords

588
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,640
that are shorter than six characters and
there and memory

589
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,180
how much apparently one is not shorter

590
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:18,820
arm so you actually give you the owner 1
so now you have for people there a log n

591
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,150
if you actually want their password to
use for stuff is now a tackle with

592
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,930
robert Bales

593
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,070
so this is a another trick to

594
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,220
to arm hope faster also for

595
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,230
a number of different things show
credentials

596
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,610
remember in plain text up in this area
so

597
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,590
as you're looking through people have
remote desktop connections open a

598
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,410
different boxes

599
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,250
and Francis their workstation systems
well the time should be able to pull the

600
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,620
password strictly had a memory

601
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,390
and so do sect of Islam my favorites
also for domain controllers

602
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,470
it will pour password histories as well
so

603
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,840
mom if you want to better crack lists
overtime by pointing to mean

604
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,820
histories as well your be able to get a
lot closer to

605
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,270
om to getting are

606
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,820
all the passwords the people have used
to them and so

607
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,490
the noticed is that people will turn to
you use variations on passwords that

608
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,580
they've used in the past

609
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,870
so if they have one password that was
harder and one pass for those

610
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:22,180
easier though you may be able to get
there the harder password

611
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,590
obvious overall says one password
cracking from easier so

612
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,200
those the the book 0 what I wanted

613
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,490
about today so that's contact info armed
if you have questions well I think

614
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,240
okay cool

615
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,930
thank you much
