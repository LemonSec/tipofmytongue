nerds we have and

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,320
the problem is that the same thing you

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,150
cakes and in Raleigh North Carolina
exist

21
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,340
stanza social security card

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,080
now this is just a handful

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,190
hundreds these now just using Google

24
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,750
in me surgeons and

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,260
summer these were even on all

26
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,080
website so like the men and women

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,090
were applying to work there yes

28
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,170
to prove their age one these guys

29
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,500
they're like NSFW images

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,870
and the and everything else in one
directory

31
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,510
pretty ridiculous tax documents

32
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,549
right there's so many of these it's
ridiculous

33
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,859
this one in particular I find these and
it kinda makes me a little bit settings

34
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:36,459
because you guys this person

35
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,459
husband-and-wife rate and then they've
got their

36
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,189
3 hits here who were all under-17

37
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:46,280
with their social security numbers so

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,450
theoretically the identity people could
commit

39
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,109
on these years wouldn't know until they
turn to page

40
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:58,249
with dude Reuters the true

41
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:02,180
so these are like abundant and

42
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,489
the queries that you have to do to get
to these are to

43
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,370
complex I'm just gonna go rupees

44
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:16,370
you're not gonna really because sp

45
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:20,730
if you wanna talk in private about she's

46
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,930
more credit cards front and back

47
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,349
these up top year were

48
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,749
from a florist and Highland

49
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:37,590
and basically every customer that came
through they would like stand the credit

50
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,139
cards

51
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:42,969
front/back great and there were hundreds

52
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:47,779
these just in this one directory so you
know the thing with

53
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:51,739
type stuff that I mostly search for I'm
not just looking for text and databases

54
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,529
or documents or whatever

55
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:58,450
you know I'm finding these high
resolutions hands super

56
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,680
ride confident nation Gerry

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,639
and then in a little bit I'll show you
how easy

58
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,650
can be defines scary

59
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,650
re: and these driver's license

60
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,989
somebody's from that same brought the
website and

61
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,850
you know even like people from North
Carolina here you know another one

62
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,740
North Carolina yes so

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,919
passports visas birth certificates

64
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,360
you know people just take pictures of
their stuff and

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,819
treated however you know

66
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,139
okay now I just like iraqis right and it
just looks like

67
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,419
reason Asian by is like my little take
on a single

68
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,599
is a tragedy million statistic

69
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,220
this one is kinda like you know the fact
that you can find

70
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,729
a social security card a credit card
running backs

71
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:05,009
and it's kind of like a big deal to me
you know like

72
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,620
just imagine if you're the person
sometimes I find things

73
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,970
like email people try to get their
information contact them say

74
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,319
your stuff is in search engines

75
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,030
here's what you need to do and Google
you know a message

76
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,870
this URL to have your information taken
down blah blah blah

77
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,370
but you know arm

78
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,490
just imagine if you're on the business
and

79
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,400
someone finding your information and
it's not even necessarily maybe your

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,190
fall

81
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,220
others companies that mishandled all the
time

82
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,970
I'm gonna show here in a second so

83
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,009
that brings us to our next thing like
how is this possible okay

84
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,229
so the ever-increasing power and number
web crawlers

85
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,330
re: so Google is the focus here

86
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,300
by the

87
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,250
Yandex by you all these other search
engines

88
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,509
are becoming equally powerful and
finding

89
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,650
the same types of information just you
know

90
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,729
different you got that

91
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:17,229
then you got careless and work was
admins

92
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,729
now it's pretty self-explanatory
end-user ignorance

93
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,090
or stupidity it's not just people beings

94
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,740
with their stuff it's kind of like
technology now

95
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,400
is excelling at a rate where someone can
register a domain

96
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,900
use it to store their music their
personal files whatever their backups

97
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,699
they don't realize that their stuff out
there like eighty legs dot com

98
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,669
every three months or so they crawl
every registered domain on the web

99
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,210
so people may think hey I bought this
website

100
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,639
I'm storm information here I haven't
posted anything to it anywhere

101
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,159
how anyone right

102
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,520
all this kinda like creates this problem
where

103
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,050
you can just find this information

104
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,340
so going back to the web crawlers saying
I kinda mentioned

105
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,150
Google and all them but also in each
search engines

106
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:18,319
there's a on out there like FTP search
engines document surgeons

107
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,699
their Greek for finding stuff that's
been

108
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:28,000
out there for years legs dot com

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,610
not just indexing data but also
identifying and understanding

110
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,840
within days

111
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,439
like on reddit there's this by I've been
seeing going around

112
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,500
and what it tries to do is anytime
anyone those like me

113
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,539
it identifies the mean and recognizes
the text

114
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:50,270
within the mean and then automatically
writes a comma

115
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,849
what the text is from the picture so

116
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:58,060
you know this is just some bot doing
this on reddit eventually

117
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,060
if Google decided or being whoever else

118
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,370
you know they could turn on some kind of
functionality were let's say you want to

119
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,210
search for social security numbers

120
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,659
some range numbers and only look for

121
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,650
intact look for in images string of text
and images

122
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,729
so you know stuff like that

123
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:24,569
more connected everything becomes the
more than index

124
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,860
you know this is kinda like the web
being more accessible to people

125
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,390
do not understand how crawlers were

126
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,880
which you know why should they watch
everyman

127
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,990
understand exactly web crawler works

128
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,870
I think it's gonna be an issue %uh
education but then

129
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,200
you know the power

130
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,570
everyday people are

131
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:59,570
search engines do not care what the
index long as they were able to and acts

132
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,200
I kinda feel like at times who should
care little more about the stuff

133
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,339
the index and they've demonstrated

134
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,769
some degrees that they do you care its

135
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,940
its very minuscule

136
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,300
and for instance for a while there they
were contacting webmasters

137
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,769
letting them know you have now where on
your site

138
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,649
ans the reason they're contacting them
is because it

139
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,079
interests their business model that

140
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,589
Google users getting website now we're
getting infected

141
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,070
makes would so if that interests them

142
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,120
gonna get inside anyway I don't think
this kind of stuff I'm going into use

143
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,120
gonna be going reckless and careless

144
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,870
admins I found this

145
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,500
just a couple weeks ago actually this
was

146
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,889
a the like an internet marketing company

147
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:05,139
by traffic from them advertised through
them

148
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,800
direct CPV username

149
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,329
arm so this was a directory

150
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:15,370
all hundreds stanza

151
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,930
credit cards and driver's license and

152
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,010
these credit card authority forms

153
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,690
authorization documents it's like these
documents

154
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,829
that direct CPV had people

155
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,920
still now their information

156
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,240
permission to charge their hard right
here

157
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,000
is one of the examples them card type

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,010
number expiration the code on the back
of the card

159
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,320
address signature

160
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,949
but this was to 21-13 so

161
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,750
literally when I first founders I could
refresh the site

162

new information

163
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,430

like I could have contacted some these

164
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,510
people the same

165
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,930

168
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,370
your completion of this authorization
form helps us to protect you

169
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,410

ridiculous very so

173
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,699
one more point about this when I found
this directory call

174
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:42,360
them when no they took it now within
five minutes never contacted me back

175
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,959
the structure of the URL had this thing
in west side

176
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,940
attachments so I search for that string
in Google URL

177
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,690
and found another directory

178
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,550
that was hosting the exact same
information

179
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,730
that they kept up for days after I told
them about

180
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,399
this one you would think they would get
a check all the other

181
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,190
you know wherever they do this anyway

clueless were careless admins in

183
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,350
in the user ignorance gates

184
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,209

222
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,759
not all of them were

223
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,839
like this this wasn't for customers
actually called them talk to the guy

224
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,199
like that CEO the company and

225
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,230
this was the company that would take
orders

226
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,779
word and they had this they were doing
some

227
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,940
something with their servers and they
briefly opened up this one section on

228
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,279
their website

229
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,350
that they had in robots that and if any
you know now

230
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,940
Google doesn't here robots that text

231
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,959
they were index what you have a robust
tax and then and description say

232
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,699
this was in robots text

233
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:30,050
crazy so just a few days this was open
and I just happen to search

234
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,040
right time and find it arm so they had
to like go through August

235
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,310
and figure out who's was real contact
offering your services

236
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:44,730
whatever all right let's go who'd

now you if you really wanna finest you
have to be prepared to do a lot

240
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,699
scrolling

241
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:01,699
because the good stuff ends up farther
down

242
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:08,149
so you have asians

243
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,360

245
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,139

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:36,790
your some

249
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:53,600
arts are

250
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,600
so images right use

251
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,790
and you click on

252
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,210
and then you click more sizes

253
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,500
over here and I'll give you more sizes

254
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,500
the same images image like this is a the
trick years

255
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,140
with words as more sizes and then
similar

256
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,510
you get a lot of clipart here too

257
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,720
so down stop

258
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,560
IRAs answer sort the size by

259
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,630
large then you garbage

260
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,890
and on world

261

really you don't even have to be doing
advance

262
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,590

presumably

268
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,680
have done this before people take a
picture

269
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,050

I kinda wanna like fire who back

277
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,179
rooms on fascinating so these are pretty
much

278
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,010
all the operators that I commonly used

279
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,330
anyone Commons and

280
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,920
if you're and any kind like programming

right if your search query

283
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,870
you results unintended results change
things up

284
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,950
and start thinking

285
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,040
in terms of things that don't make sense
sometimes we take some

286
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,650
operators and you through them together
in certain ways these really interesting

287
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,650
results you expect

288
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,970
sir sir operators

289
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:12,970
goals

290
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,520
take time to thank you weary

291
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,390
through or just start word

292
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:28,030
so what do you want fine private videos
and photographs

293
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,980
confidential information databases

294
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,220
back emails hard right back

295
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,000
virtual machines things

296
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,550
now custom application files scripts

297
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,750
mentions plugins on user names and
passwords

298
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,920
and games franz credit cards

299
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,080
numbers earlier right just what do you
want search

300
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,790
for example here

301
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:06,010
searching for virtual machines right
tried

302
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,630
weary entitled Windows

303
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,580
and then like you virtual machine

304
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,679
filed that results

305
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,050
okay that's because the operator

306
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:28,660
and so you just removed

307
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,330
and the 75 results which you know

308
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:40,330
course a lot of garbage virtual machines

309
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,300
right like this 20

310
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,570
when 7 virtual machine image

311
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,440
what can you do found one from Georgia
Tech University

312
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,410
their VPN stuff use magic

313
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,600
key finder to get the licenses or and
Windows

314
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,600
and yeah great thinking in direct and
indirect turns

315
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,910
missus things me the most successful

316
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:18,400
stuff that I search for don't just
search

317
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,440
were exact extensions what you're
looking

318
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,540
something related search because
sometimes Google

319
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,070
and virtual machines

320
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,900
sometimes they will index you know the
I'd

321
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,980
but they will its related so you can
look for directories

322
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,690
howls related were and then you can

323
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,850

in the gay HTTP and HTTPS

335
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:29,500
URL that brought up its

336
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,150
while in URL because that makes

337
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,470
you think return whatever

338
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,780
