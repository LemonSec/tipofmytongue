1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,790
well happy Saint Patrick's Day we've got
a up

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,599
get into sees it here

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,700
so got some lucky charms and

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,650
like okay anyway every year we talked
last year how the West was Paul we talk

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,520
about last year

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,910
time or well when we do return

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,230
cybersecurity what directions are we
going to look over time we find out that

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,560
we're slowly working our way

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,689
noonday 28 private call the pony right
because for

10
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,980
say is that it's easier and easier for
stopping it

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,710
phone on the system the concern I'm
talking about now is not use an

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,059
individual anybody else

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,809
by the west side the western United
States Canada Western Europe mostly

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,539
industrialized nations we think

15
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,430
beings never realize receive this giant
sucking sound going to the east

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,690
with apologies ross perot and why we
concerned about that was gonna affect

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,890
our economic well-being our society or
stability are critical infrastructure

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,800
things like that

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,859
and here in a position to do something
about it so

20
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:06,860
last year we talk about hacking is an
active war we look at the activities

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,240
what was going on with folks like this
you're getting paid to go ahead and ACA

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,920
en masse

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,280
against United States of America we
found statistics suggest that there is

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
many as a hundred and sixty thousand
really operated

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,619
working directly cyber espionage against

26
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:26,840
other nations and going back to the
doctrines of Sunzu

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,979
remember that I'm page 1 line 1

28
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:33,590
for sentences all warfare is based on

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,090
so we expect that we should anticipate
that because if we're reading their

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,790
playbook we can understand a little bit
about what they're thinking you

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,340
a professor Leo to set all work for
transferring symmetry

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,159
which is a small creates a large output
doesn't cyber really allow you to do

33
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,409
that

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,180
really evens the playing field in the
industrialized nation

35
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,280
for having every capacity you could take
whatever you got

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,350
getting the free and so if you're China
you can play

37
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,479
if you're iraq you can play even north
korea's taken both

38
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,939
their computers using a precise address
okay so

39
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,509
the height is anybody can play now but
then I went back

40
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,940
more research back value remember him

41
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,959
Prince and there is a statement in there

42
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,270
that was very relevant he said there's
no avoiding for only postpone

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,959
others so last year I talk about hacking
is an active warrant

44
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,620
we have not seen a lot cyber warfare
answer the question why we have not

45
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,239
I think life yes but advantages allied

46
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,910
worry I always

47
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,910
Chinese exactly lucky charms

48
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,170
alright right to down what fire for a
fact

49
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,140
not really

50
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,930
that's a problem okay so

51
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,930
Yorkers who want to I called me was
doing all this stuff

52
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,470
we like to think that we can pretty much
a tribute effort you know attribution

53
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,519
his was difficult things to do

54
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,650
because you can reflector attack
everybody else we're looking at trying

55
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,280
to come up with some way to define

56
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,769
whose cause the problem well China we
find out a pretty unique

57
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,970
1.3 billion people Carl Sagan that

58
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,609
as compared United States but around 30
million Canada

59
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,769
about it the US the city of Chongqing

60
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,230
in China has nearly the same population
nation

61
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,280
people packed in a small area

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,239
or secure Raleigh and the word on other
order magnitude yet if you look at the

63
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:41,919
area

64
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,159
the nation's noisily so Russia's largest
followed by Canada and China

65
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,409
United States water area actually

66
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:53,970
New Jersey US just a little bit up third
place over with

67
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,790
interesting politics what's happening
right now

68
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,120
china is making claims number about
lying Islands

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,340
out there in the South China Sea the
western Pacific saying well

70
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,370
this is ours Red Rock 100 nautical mile
run a-rod

71
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,359
territorial waters so that we can get
bigger mineral rights

72
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,269
for undersea exploration but politically
it's getting really interesting because

73
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,389
now they're going up against places like
that only

74
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,570
and in South Korea Philippines and other
nations in that area basically claiming

75
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,990
Little Rock Center out there

76
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,349
something which go underwater it full I
yet they're building

77
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:36,889
airstrips things like that to extend the
reach military strategy with a look

78
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,289
doing is building three defensive rings
around outside ring

79
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:43,539
first row violence is an things like I'd

80
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,990
I'm and the second row rings things like

81
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,099
I don't know while I in the third row
actually goes as far out

82
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:55,190
why and so if you look at what they're
doing

83
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,360
China trying to become regional wanna
see

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,690
we on the western Pacific its our
territory United States neutral

85
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,940
already been here since 1945 tried

86
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,000
area so in addition military efforts
economically

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,010
as well as industrially a lot of other
things and sources

88
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,479
sake grand scheme which is designed to
return China

89
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,700
with they believe is the rightful place
in history if you go back in a bit

90
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,159
the last centuries the largest economy
in the world

91
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,450
said US

92
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,150
giving back those lucky charms up

93
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,659
well okay its China okay we find out
that the Chinese

94
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:45,440
believe the rightful places as number
one went to china's

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,620
support 1840s back

96
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,479
wars when Great Britain West or try to
trade with the chinese we don't want to

97
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:54,779
buy

98
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,389
anything you got really want your hard
currency Michael and their psyche and

99
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,340
buy something like that

100
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,800
if I said hey let's all mopey i'm
looking all drug addict finally

101
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,710
Chinese ever so we got this up shut down
the borders the borders they shut down

102
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,479
until when

103
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:11,180
rattle rattle okay until 1972 when

104
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,440
richard nixon came over there because
even in the revolutionary much

105
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,750
isolationist okay

106
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,240
how'd at least

107
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,699
future so if you take a look at the
People's Republic

108
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,510
find out also that they're very closely
approaching the largest

109
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,580
speaking population plan about 300
million people

110
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,960
asterisk down there Roger Maris 61

111
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,400
and it says essentially that this also
includes people who are

112
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,570
have introductory level knowledge of the
English language

113
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,589
for the most part you can read Unix
commands you can read

114
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,849
you can do a lot of stuff functional in
this area

115
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:52,979
also they look at the five year plan 12
five-year plan

116
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,210
the past 60 years backers a revolution
but

117
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,589
one other major 7 priorities is new
information technology

118
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,699
broadband networks internet security
infrastructure Wow

119
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,229
have a national major five-year effort
for

120
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,839
information security infrastructure the
Internet became decide

121
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,050
and network convergence and their
intellectual work plan is really talking

122
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,409
about

123
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:22,440
strengthening in like a property
transformation and holding

124
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,750
transforming utilize intellectual
property first you have to

125
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,870
appropriated exactly and so we're gonna
find out

126
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,479
is that someone eventually couldn't find
a ride fifty-year strategic plan for

127
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:36,019
China

128
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,969
which about twenty five years and a good
start mediate which suggests that their

129
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:42,919
goals on ninety percent of property
plant under

130
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,070
within 25 more years are

131
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:53,070
track so how's yessir

132
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,530
interesting well some with people so it
suggests that

133
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,970
certain individuals emigrated with crazy
intelligence

134
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:19,319
both nations but no I have not heard
that that's very very interesting

135
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,680
generic shaping

136
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,099
member china for years one policy which
now gives them a couple interesting

137
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:25,860
factor

138
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,610
got a pretty robust work because there's
a big imbalance

139
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,250
workers compared to all people so not a
whole lot of overhead are but there's

140
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,890
also about

141
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,909
almost some places 1 15 to 100 ratio of
male to female

142
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,399
because when you can select your
offspring Camelback more useful for your

143
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,169
family so now is a lot of

144
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,820
satisfy testosterone and way

145
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,860
most nations of bat pressure is or

146
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,399
attrition so we'll see how this one goes
but that's a very interesting insight US

147
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:56,940
organized

148
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,089
an extra arm well we have the department

149
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:06,870
alright friends for years and years we
recognize that we had different element

150
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,899
provided us with resources we have
defense contractors course

151
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,520
suppliers because without the
contractors and suppliers well

152
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,190
we just be at the point yet and it turns
out that ultimately what's the big

153
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,940
principle behind the military United
States is civilian control

154
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,820
military so of course we have to cover
the United States of America my way

155
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,709
there's or it's not just that because
what we get for the contractors

156
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,130
who else comes into the contractor
houses but SPD so

157
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,649
their pleadings about the bottom and
what we buy our products and services

158
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:36,399
what happens

159
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,480
well we get coverage and he's good so
many things

160
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,520
working their way into weapons platforms
and the like

161
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,890
and ultimately a core somebody stealing
all the stuff answers

162
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,890
people I love the fact when you find out
like the

163
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:03,600
the US has the other Pentagon has
T-shirts prenup stock tried

164
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,930
so

165
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,010
how do you characterize this whole thing
I mean it's basically upon boy sandwich

166
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,010
I mean they got us at both that

167
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,660
it's so if that's a situation well

168
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,310
our Paul at stop so

169
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,779
recognizing that we're not going to be
able to go ahead

170
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,010
and necessarily reply in kind

171
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,329
at least for a couple more years which
point kids grow up

172
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,829
cause trouble and even the score what do
we do well

173
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:39,940
course we just have to turn to
corporations because United States is a

174
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,070
little demand yet

175
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,800
as just in time for our essay who'd

176
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,000
or man and had to report any pt1 what it
was it was essentially saying we're

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,300
doing the attribution

178
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,560
we're going to pin down not only the
organization it's doing it but the

179
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,480
street address in the last long and
everything else like that

180
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,709
number people and the resources and
everything else we recommend

181
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,930
report okay anyway like downloadable has
around reading

182
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,449
okay we also care right 3 many dot com
you can take a look at it and they have

183
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:12,490
an Intel report here's my question

184
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,540
why isn't the same be issued by United
States government white house okay

185
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,740
so this was the Paul Boise do it right

186
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,970
but the reality is we're finding out
that that's not those real structure

187
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,579
this is the new world order because were
planning on these guys

188
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,570
they're trying to like a in awhile I
don't work for I have no financial

189
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,760
interest in it but I just looking at an
outside

190
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,959
third party as I come on people if your
government be a government speak up for

191
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,510
yourself

192
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,110
you're talking about a PT in this whole
thing was about advanced persistent

193
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,800
threat and so if you can look at what is
an appt

194
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,230
it's a cyber adversary with advanced
capability its also

195
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,529
three-letter marketing dream for a lot
of companies they will busy

196
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,399
unity general the idea is it's
somebody's

197
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,690
this decade hang around a long long time
and they do bad things

198
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,740
all right some people would suggest that
also mother-in-law

199
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,020
but in this case were more concerned
about cyber if you take a look at the

200
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,899
appt one that was demonstrated

201
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,540
described report they talk about some
pretty amazing

202
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,240
track record of accomplishments and
success a huge

203
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,319
about penetration and persistency
average person's being just under 1 year

204
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:23,600
one of them was over four years months

205
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,620
okay them yet entire presidential
administration ends

206
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,870
to be inside network US-made

207
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,870
defense apartment where US government
agency stay there

208
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,260
persist eclectic electric finally found
a number that was bigger than US

209
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,120
national debt

210
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,230
was as of this morning $16 trillion
dollars but about 1 petabyte updated

211
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,150
looking just you and if you look for the
report

212
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,089
the seven percent targets are
english-speaking seven-percent machines

213
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,370
are being used

214
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,589
registered so they're at the point where
they say like you really care about this

215
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:57,490
after fusion

216
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,050
right why bother to pay extra money to
go daddy: when we have our own register

217
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:07,260
besides maybe don't watch their that we
have anywhere attack infrastructure

218
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,990
about out there it's being used are
against United States so

219
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,390
name names locations being a real PL
unit 6 1398

220
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,230
that particular building kinda reminds
me an experiment 626 right

221
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,660
except I figured that we're going to
recall him a little bit for the purposes

222
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,000
and that became like a really cool logo

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,069
I guess I'll have to request fair use
for this because it's

224
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:34,670
copyright somebody's Disney but
nonetheless a beloved

225
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,579
modification to parity I think I could
get away with it

226
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:42,790
you find out that these folks are
formally organized the People's

227
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,910
Liberation Army

228
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,300
the people's liberation army own the
military's

229
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,970
if you're the Chinese navy what UN

230
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,839
ples the People's Liberation Army's
maybe

231
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,870
I always wonder how the to the army

232
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,420
but I don't have the Navy where we ate
know last few years

233
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,980
but

234
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,760
huge money people capabilities course
offense workfare

235
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,699
so is the same report comes out we find
out that again

236
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:17,120
pretty much ok that matter what we do
that they're going to do whatever they

237
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,040
want to us

238
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,240
and we don't see any pretty adequate
defense is so what's United States

239
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,760
what about this okay leave a name names
lol regal ugly gorilla

240
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,779
super hard things like that and no this
is not some sort of a porn shop

241
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,000
they actually handles people are picking
go ahead using

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,569
interestingly enough power a point where
was going out

243
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:42,670
trying to identify agates pictures these
guys

244
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,910
every now and then you know you get the
the people who

245
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,689
that weekend export them in again
reserved well

246
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,949
but for the most part thought it was
pretty cool thing i'd

247
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:57,540
these people but Hill in the report

248
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,130
we'd expect reply rises from China we
expect an onslaught of criticism

249
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,880
wide got paid a boatload of money to do
it

250
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,880
money work so what's the secret to
pierce the spawning success

251
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:19,439
systems why don't people

252
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:22,740
people do not like all effect if you
look at some of the patterns that the

253
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,089
cyclical they come into work in the
morning

254
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,930
so there are a lot of it is like love
our neighbors business hours are

255
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,630
other things that make them successful
ideology

256
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,059
because they believe that what they're
doing is patriotism for China

257
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,819
and they will also recruit Chinese
ancestry

258
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:43,439
people in the United States saying this
is something that would be good to do

259
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:47,050
so we look at some of the things like
the economic espionage act in the case

260
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,449
is actually a report

261
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:51,890
many them against chinese not Chinese
citizens US

262
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,000
citizens they were from Chinese ancestry
also if you

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
grandma back in your country they could
ninety a little bit

264
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,180
no repercussions because the whole idea
is what are we gonna do about

265
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,380
on the ice ACLU's legal system like that
in China they have their own legal

266
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,199
system

267
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,540
but what is the legal system the world
call

268
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,589
when nobody's in charge when you call it
anarchy

269
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,540
exactly and so the international order
things is anarchy which is whatever you

270
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,459
can get away with

271
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,899
away otherwise your gonna be looking at
different forms a government

272
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,630
but I think the secret to their success
is that you just can't find where

273
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:38,630
they're at

274
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:47,750
thousand bird droppings

275
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:51,069
something like that thousand brings the
rice I think

276
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:54,119
first president bush in 2000 points of
light that was mild

277
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,360
after that fiber-optic for him work too
well

278
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,610
but anyway because they're pouring
outside

279
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,749
say that's not suggest necessarily that
but will probably

280
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:08,490
redo their model a little bit and
seeking their party's is that again

281
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,770
hard attribution are you gonna prove
other pony

282
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,199
now if we look at the nak government
statement US National Intelligence

283
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,289
Estimate was just released last month

284
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:21,110
February great let's take a look at it

285
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,419
you get a whole lot of money in terms
intelligence agencies reviewing things

286
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,799
that we can look at the report

287
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:30,840
however comma its classified so we can
see what they got to say at least at

288
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,820
this level but presumably that they had
something useful to say so right after

289
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,360
the 10 the primary what happens

290
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,659
are Irish President Barack Obama I
figured I had

291
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:42,870
related Saint Patty's Day in his

292
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:49,870
alright alright I know lucky charms here

293
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,870
but stay we know for countries company
Swiper corporate secrets and

294
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,850
shortly thereafter Mike Rogers chairman
House Intelligence Committee

295
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,909
training stealing our intellectual
property to rate the qualifies as an

296
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:04,600
epidemic

297
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,620
got it but course we doing about it
which is making statements

298
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,390
so pretty sure to add your new economy
as we find out that

299
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,039
what happens when we have one point four
billion dollar trillion dollars if US

300
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:16,740
data like

301
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,809
where they start dumping all that on the
open market dollar could be destabilized

302
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,570
the way that George Soros the same lies
upon

303
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,370
the way up we currency what's up

304
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,760
0 even of black and white Republic 15
billion marks one dollar

305
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,850
but we keep think because United States
currency destabilize

306
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,890
same hubris includes make put us in
danger

307
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,750
also tryna Russia you are working very
very hard

308
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,549
to remove the US dollars the de facto
standard

309
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:53,080
national trade really a good alternate

310
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,510
the renminbi does an exchange well

311
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,679
part internet money

312
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:07,130
Korean yes we need a lot more so

313
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,230
that we look at the same for the
national security by

314
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,389
United States just mark this call

315
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:16,919
coming up this week tough it is to get
these people all released the statement

316
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,340
I'm Carolina con copper that I had to
write this abstract for a month and a

317
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,880
half ago

318
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,240
sleep but look at it

319
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,139
cybersecurity a growing challenge to our
economic relationship

320
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:33,230
US businesses are worried about it we
need to engage ourselves in a

321
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,389
constructive dialogue

322
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:38,149
public weapons stop

323
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:42,169
just go ahead the other day it's easy to
call State Department

324
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,330
the Defense Department okay because
they're cheaper and they tend to get the

325
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,139
job done with us

326
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:52,649
really check your people are employed
with the US State Department boys

327
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:57,299
nor

328
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:01,159
16 sixty 50,000 visor

329

actions cause for about 6 about

330
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,149
the loadout fully aircraft carrier

331
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:12,779
goes out to sea with their way I mean
seriously that's that's that's what they

332
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:13,620
got usage

333
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,149
working with people call defense
department nation-build

334
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:22,200
role that's why we've seen extended wars
over Iraq and Afghanistan

335
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,450
doing missions typically were not part
US military mission

336
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,000
now the next day

337
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,500
record National Intelligence James
clapper talk Senate point out

338
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,429
russia and China girlfriends Russia
aggressive practitioner economic

339
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:39,039
espionage

340
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,059
also want up in the top four along with
Russian

341
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,059
or Israel

342
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:50,570
France French very good

343
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,130
Brazil in the other coming up as well
Rep

344
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,799
and so there at were basically same
where power they got us

345
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,399
and now 72 hours ago

346
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:06,610
president Obama

347
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,539
calls President Shi Jing

348
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:14,320
congratulate him on the election as
president now people next

349
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,620
years and he says oh by the way

350
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,220
when you talk about the cyber security
thing they can

351
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,070
Chinese restaurants or something like
that let's talk about cybersecurity

352
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,389
sorry getting to the point where you
were bringing up all this bluster

353
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:33,210
but you know what's the translation is
government statement another worker

354
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,220
like are common what are we going to do
about

355
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,789
we're get own and the problem is that
our infrastructure people are strategies

356
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,409
are policies are doctrine

357
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:50,049
are not working effectively to give us
compare that to a society like north

358
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:50,460
korea

359
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,530
I mean it's really tough to get one
other computers even

360
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,210
training territory getting into the
society understanding

361
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,100
even when the %uh they had their new

362
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,200
great leader 16 which is

363
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,620
John on from John it's like

364
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,139
grandson okays family but the first
reports

365
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:18,260
guy was so extraordinarily good job
maintaining control over information

366
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,720
cost side report earlier this week

367
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,580
saying for the quarter maybe happen the
population physically started

368
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,030
girl because yet they can go ahead

369
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,159
develop nuclear weapons test they can go
ahead

370
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,879
rockets build military and thats

371
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:39,039
real concern because as we look at
things such as worthy

372
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,429
rational actors out there always put on
blinders on okay

373
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,820
Russia rational actor rational actor

374
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,789
this mutually assured destruction
countries like Iran

375
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:53,270
or maybe north korea we say hey we don't
get their doings

376
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,850
declared me irrational the danger here
though is

377
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,990
necessarily ascribe your own
decision-making strategies

378
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,220
to your potential on back in nineteen
ninety in golf one

379
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,929
when saddam hussein way everybody was in
the press reports bacteria

380
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:13,919
Batman this guy's not some crazy things
like that has worked for the company

381
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,850
wanna guys Saudi Arabia and people how
to talk about this crazy guy was going

382
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,799
on in

383
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,559
said something like this crazy saw the
desert back

384
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,559
well say

385
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,990
explain this to me why is this the law

386
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,029
well call there in the bed when is that
if your neighbor or friend

387
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:39,760
your honor-bound toward try to strike
until

388
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,210
now blocks the blow okay

389
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,020
after Spencer you go back to be a
neighbor's but you go ahead in US for

390
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,870
somebody you fully expect to get someone
who had whack at

391
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,100
so in this particular case the perceived

392
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,500
fans was kuwait popping all the water
out of the water

393
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,159
girl oil oil table and very very
predictable

394
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,649
with intelligence services look at the
world prism

395
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:08,279
experience a lot of times people as well

396
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,570
so if portrayal US

397
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,020
chinese relations how would that be
where are we something like this

398
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:22,000
where you know it's just not working out
too well for us

399
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,510
course the official chinese response to
all that is what we didn't do it

400
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,559
nobody can prove it are and we saw me
you can't prove anything

401
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,700
so it sounded a lot like like this guy
okay

402
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,879
now is there any reason for ZIP

403
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:40,139
bar sorry I it's an old stereotype

404
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:43,470
many years ago but the point is is that
they're officials

405
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,149
say we didn't do it you can't prove it
even if you get caught red-handed

406
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:51,629
deny everything okay really works well
in politics why not try to the National

407
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:54,899
so what's the score are we doing

408
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:58,889
we say was 1001

409
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:03,320
20 Jahre it's worse than $10,000 like
playing against Ken Jennings

410
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,590
and you know he is like completely
taking everything we have and where the

411
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,330
whole

412
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,360
and just a runaway

413
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,169
so you gotta stop because the problem is
if you think about it economically

414
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:20,379
if you develop a product or drug or some
technology

415
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:23,559
spend years in a lot of money and time
and effort

416
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,460
developing that intellectual property
then you have to recapture that over

417
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,619
time

418
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:31,710
by be able to pay for it upfront
investment xilisoft

419
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,659
drugs that people go ahead by its like
why is it on so much to

420
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:41,250
develop dollars all clinical trials and
things

421
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,470
the file for a pack and then patents
good for how long

422
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,730
twenty years from the date piling get

423
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,700
so anytime the FDA tests and things like
that it might be forty

424
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,290
twenty-year cycle here

425
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,220
your your money back from that and so is
a result we have to look at this

426
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,510
somebody then your $20,000 10 days what

427
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,510
drugs the market character out

428
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,090
why why are they cheaper conceded have
to pay the upfront cost

429
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,369
type are working very general people's
liberation army or an app

430
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:20,559
really I would be doing exactly the same
thing that they're doing now

431
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,669
it is irrational madman

432
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:27,559
is basically good international business

433
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:31,220
an arc world an

434
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,619
however being an American hey wait a
minute we're kinda

435
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,510
score we like to it not go ahead take
away some of his points

436
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,379
at least defender points so we need to
be able to think about self-defense

437
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:48,869
now we could always call nato there is
an 80 in Article five for self defense

438
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:52,159
any nation in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization

439
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,320
attack all the others agree that they
will respond as well

440
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,780
and it was formed back in 1949 against
what threat

441
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,830
be Soviet Union so we have missus

442
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:12,799
but I guess after here but the idea of
the Soviet Union was remembered

443
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,250
group grew got bigger and bigger and of
course it was

444
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,649
domino theory worried about vietnam one
country Paul

445
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:25,059
and sold the russian tanks coming to the
folder gap

446
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:28,700
3 scare me was the biggest concern that
we had well the only with

447
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,789
bolt September 12 2001

448
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:36,280
people say how many nations are involved
in the coalition

449
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,549
Afghanistan how many

450
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:43,039
three or four

451
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,250
13 come down a little bit but all
members

452
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,590
made over there in other nations such as
South Korea

453
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,580
Australia sum up the nation's Easter

454
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,190
wanted to go ahead folks why

455
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,000
now if you're in ukraine Belarus

456
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,149
Georgia nations like

457
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:10,780
your next door neighbor rush who would
you love to have all your friends come

458
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,409
and rescue you if you ended up being
invaded

459
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:17,399
well the problem is if you're Western
Europe you really wanna go ahead and I

460
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:18,350
for

461
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,570
something Indosat euros of Paktia
provinces

462
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,119
in Georgia is what were those invaded by
the russians

463
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,799
August 2000 8 what's happening in August

464
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,389
2008 dot dot dot dot

465
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:37,599
you everybody's looking to the Olympics
the russians haven't

466
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,080
the way that attack Georgia was
accompanied by

467
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,340
massive cyber attacks pretty much blind
at all the command-and-control

468
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,599
infrastructure

469
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,820
government because a couple years
earlier we found out that up

470
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,820
estonia with a movie statue of the
Russian liberator

471
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,639
out at the downtown area first
houstonians didn't really feel that

472
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:00,919
liberated from 1945 to 1980

473
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,649
there is a big are clashing attack
against government but

474
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:09,440
each case what was the international
response

475
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,440
much okay yes sir

476
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:29,740
yeah

477
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,600
I'll 20

478
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,529
warning about this his attacks were not
attributable to russian military units

479
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:37,320
were twentysomething

480
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,690
are beyond Russian business network so
what happens when you get a civilian

481
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,260
agency or simply an entity

482
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,590
as a proxy for the government and if you
look at why do that when its European

483
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,190
survive

484
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,669
well I for reports that there's somebody
there the head over who has a very close

485
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:57,590
family relationship with the guy by the
name Putin the president who is

486
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,440
previously the Prime Minister was
freezing the present its army and the

487
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,770
idea is is that if you pay enough
tribute to the government

488
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,880
private do what you want but where the
lines are getting blurred because that

489
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,830
asymmetry here

490
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,070
this is almost like mercenaries and so
if you have mercenaries working for you

491
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,270
which goes back always back to Roman
Empire some people

492
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,840
romantic would fight their own war our
people to go ahead

493
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,990
like invaders and things like that
eventually

494
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,659
a mercenary what happened things too bad
was working for a paycheck

495
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,470
but if your families are a threat your
lifestyle

496
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,580
nations hang in there make something
work

497
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,679
and so the concern here is cyber

498
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,159
is with a view to the fact actually kick
in when we go Cybertech

499
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,500
so again your question is a good one but
the hard part is we have not got to the

500
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,490
point where that's worked its way either
into the international relations

501
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:54,330
for the court level or problem article
fifty one united nations

502
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,470
also has self defense criterion there in
fact that's how the weekend up in korea

503
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,480
things ass last year was a little tricky
question last

504
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,649
US declared war for anybody and it was
Romania Hungary Bulgaria

505
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:11,059
1942 yes you know that you sell the
group

506
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:15,070
has also Ken Jennings

507
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,289
but are I gave that talking a big girl

508
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:22,600
last year right work improved and I got
accepted to talk or

509
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,669
art critical got to go to Ireland

510
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,409
and I said well you know I gotta Egypt
Irish gotta change

511
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,409
020 you in these asses little

512
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:37,070
language nuances with this US going to
worse I doesn't make sense we look at

513
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,899
how will do well as the last undeclared
war

514
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:46,110
and do the research well it turns out it
was against Great Britain in 1922

515
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,440
answers happy audiences from the UK have
with Ireland

516
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,680
really want to start a bar brawl

517
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,180
I left it out at the presentation but is
we find out that

518
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,630
it's one way to go ahead and do that but
the problem chain challenging big

519
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,890
nations is a course they usually can
bring a lot more hardcore than you can

520
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,970
in the kinetic world asymmetry is not

521
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,210
a really good idea okay in the cyber
world he said

522
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,530
works pretty well it so what came out
this attack

523
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,040
open this tony was a formation the nato
Cyber Security Centre for Excellence

524
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,830
and the cooperative Cyber Security
Centre for Excellence had put together

525
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,420
about three years ago see how do we look
at the rules and laws a worker

526
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,600
SRX and then map those cyberspace

527
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
and then developed by the 215 page draft

528
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,680
the eyes crossed be published and you
can go to this particular

529
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,690
you're all CCD OE CEO eat out or

530
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,790
249 about and if you look at that

531
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:47,220
their goal was to say how can we buy
consensus get

532
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,900
the laws that apply kinetic

533
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,200
for and apply them cyberwar why the
manual because

534
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,350
are no international treaties cyber rape

535
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,700
and as a result its brand new
territories thought was a week

536
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,700
with the kinda ground true what work

537
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,780
maybe that's a start point for how we
build cyber warfare

538
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,420
rules and laws trees so with a high
level it looks

539
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,900
at what's writer justice in Warren
before war

540
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,140
and if it doesn't ball the use of force
is not address

541
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,470
so if you go back and you look at
something like the invasion but the

542
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,970
cyber attacks that were on estonia

543
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,220
back in 06 when they move this well that
was not any

544
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,490
physical equivalent to that so that
doesn't count a cyberwar

545
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,940
let's look at something like I'd all
that

546
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,400
which involve physical destruction
things

547
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,010
that would qualify active site or
because something actually breaks

548
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,820
so it's develop

549
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,080
95 rules aside that

550
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,720
all your and several o'dougherty

551
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,530
I was in a degree but yeah it was
international concerns so let's take a

552
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,180
look at a couple

553
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,160
go throw 95 if you're attacked

554
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,950
you can reap respond which is reasonable
that's really warfare

555
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:15,129
reduce attack and rule eleven defines it
when it's actually

556
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:18,480
use a force when a break something when
he kills people wouldn't damage is

557
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,780
something in the physical world

558
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,860
you can do self defense and you do
collective self-defence

559
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,919
and now you can figure out the law of
armed conflict

560
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,169
so georgia was a local armed conflict if
you captured

561
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:33,500
your console your review caption russian
soldier but they were

562
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,520
reform in there were fighting rules a
little bit different than a summer

563
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,310
criminal so

564
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,560
you're grandfathered Germany now in his
eighties months ago

565
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,149
army arrest say we your great
grandfather killed my great grandfather

566
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:47,889
on a battlefield at the Bell Ball

567
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,540
therefore killed there are certain rules
if you buy

568
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,690
by them worker here okay

569
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,940
now if you were Jack the Ripper you want
to or because unlike johan the river

570
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,550
anyone around killing people over in
germany that's a different story

571
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,130
commanders can still be held

572
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:10,170
accountable for war crimes cyberwar
where they do it

573
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,890
your BlackBerry it this is kinda
interest

574
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,270
it's a combatant status what makes you a
lawful combat

575
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,270
lawful combat somebody uniform

576
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,730
declared war or none declared war with
the pretty identifiable

577
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,260
volunteers are people likes out the
window to passing through

578
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,400
you don't get any defense come back in
house

579
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,930
yup was interesting if you look

580
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,630
international laws it pertains to
kinetic warfare if there is not a

581
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,710
commander in charge

582
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,720
there's no responsible leader the
participants are entitled to protection

583
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,930
under the laws

584
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,400
combat so I don't know what about that

585
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,450
forming an organization such as up

586
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,370
having somebody in charge suggests that
not

587
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,840
participants are going to be afforded
any protections under the law

588
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,590
and cyberterrorism

589
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:06,160
get to that point terrorist attacks

590
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,700
like 9/11 was definitely activity

591
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,970
from los worker cyber world look for the
equivalence

592
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,970
and walking to blow up of it's kind of a
civilian and military jacket you can do

593
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,980
it so an airstrip

594
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,370
using for civilian and military go after
drop

595
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,480
robbed grammar school

596
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,000
doesn't what if it on a military base no
it's not a military purpose you don't do

597
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,390
that

598
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,450
but you can use ruses the world school

599
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,500
interesting cyber booby traps are
prohibited

600
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,609
horses don't click arm

601
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:46,250
if you have any kid 15 make

602
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,930
Africa batons because like cop his rules

603
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,390
records on the internet from for people
but interesting that they would actually

604
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,290
try to translate

605
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,660
again editorialized same what are the
rules a comment

606
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,720
war and it's not be able to do that
diplomatic

607
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,800
protected new prostate canelo believe
stack

608
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,720
when was under attack dude the nation
George

609
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,820
American businessman from Atlantic
hosting company

610
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,640
wayside was going to go on South he said

611
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,880
can you host stop the electronics

612
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,370
government for the nation relocated to
Atlanta for a while

613
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,990
and then they came under cyberattack
expect the IP addresses

614
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:34,990
model that United States

615
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,390
was mercenaries well profitable but

616
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,740
because my husband is a courtesy

617
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,810
what's happening as we go to handheld
devices we go to cloud computing is that

618
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,150
perimeter road network is completely
dissolved

619
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,650
protect our intellectual property
resources is pretty much going down to

620
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,820
zero

621
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,490
we expect information free for anywhere
and because everything is getting

622
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,080
globalize we're going to a global
economy

623
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,120
you can no longer be a fortress the last
remaining economic fortress is our

624
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,040
political for

625
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,810
like north korea we see your pretty
dysfunctional

626
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,930
in global society doesn't work right
this game

627
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,370
so might happen because cyber world

628
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,180
and the course what happened this week
by one of the things that really

629
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,960
surprises

630
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,200
us and we can expect that attack but

631
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,250
take pics so doctor Tom Adams said

632
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:33,310
talked about worker space he saying that
things are happening so fast

633
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:38,780
can because by the time you take a look
at it analyzed think about it whatever

634
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:44,240
all pack ride so it's not like the old
days where you go ahead

635
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,960
your cap work I'll see you said about
things get this big thing

636
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,890
slides around this work is going to be
over in milliseconds

637
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,120
so at that particular point as we go
from

638
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,450
cyber espionage which is not worth a
rental by the way why are we not a war

639
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:05,350
advantages they're collecting so much
good stuff

640
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,840
to go back history books what happens
Romans came in

641
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,870
took you over demand from you tribute

642
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,350
tribute basically said you pay them the

643
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,620
for them occupy you you live

644
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,710
otherwise care a lot of stuff down like
a lot of people

645
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,520
make things right go back like biblical
about

646
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,010
Romans were in there and it kinda made
life right for you the Middle East

647
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,940
but if you happen to be in a nation or a
place for you pay the tribute

648
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,370
of they were good he's also suggest

649
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,010
pretend to be in control because you can
do by the way

650
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,330
his comments thousand

651
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,970
alright so years ago 34 C

652
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,670
so when we conclude

653
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,800
we're going to take a short are taking
our

654
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,359
finally go ahead with a better way to do
business but more importantly

655
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,590
I think you want to think about what can
we do as individuals

656
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,400
is part of this we have a nation we have
an idea that security

657
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,540
where they were educational or
professional but can we contribute

658
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,770
to not only the body of knowledge

659
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,770
forcep process

660
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:24,060
here in the United States you do have
access rights laws

661
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,210
it's a staffer okay so

662
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,450
he calling three thousand-page health
care law

663
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,850
rape caused

664
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,230
behavior and we can cuddle it damage

665
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,830
otherwise find out that we Western
nations

666
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:46,020
and the collective are gonna see our
intellectual property sold

667
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,300
side over to the east Caceres is right
doing

668
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:56,300
about initial thoughts

669
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:06,570
yes

670
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,790
have known about it for years we've
known about

671
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:33,790
Tiger is nothing new in that

672
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,940
report some are you missing a released
time for our say so go ahead

673
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,570
from them up is also some suggestions
said it was a well coordinated with the

674
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,760
US government to say well

675
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,580
State Department can't really stop
directly to this too provocative

676
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,400
so lady neutral third-party I
corporation really

677
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,510
now we can start doing the talking
points that we think that we want to get

678
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,080
out the door

679
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:10,710
tech

680
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,800
same the comment I don't know I can
speak

681
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,570
Chinese it's a parent is tough to get

682
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,400
yessir just complain that we are going

683
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,430
yet to take a look at some stage
McDonald

684
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,870
Alexander is not going to lose a few
years director an essay in its third

685
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,370
years

686
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:37,270
matter your cyber command's stalking
this past week in the National

687
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,710
Intelligence director's comments

688
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:42,170
10 yeah we're developing offense
capability

689
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,200
the whole idea offenses cyber weapons
about

690
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:53,200
okay because yessir

691
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:14,720
so what can you do with the

692
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,130
which I was one of the most rapidly yes
question is if it's pretty obvious we're

693
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,620
trying to get the United States book

694
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,710
let's go back a little history book
nineties what happened kayak

695
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,940
China well shoot your needs and your
family a bill

696
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:46,840
ball is pretty serious crime but then
Anabel first 2001 the US EP 3 collided

697
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,170
with the chinese GA

698
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,430
cause a loss at Chinese aircraft
remember the Chinese

699
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,440
by the way one-way

700
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,290
I was a hot dog is gonna be out on the
flap US aircraft

701
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,020
all signs in the window well then what I
had heard about at the time was

702
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,380
the Chinese government it said hey with
United States is doing to us the peace

703
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,670
pipe lines offer Coast

704
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,350
you should go hack America well the
Chinese are gone knots

705
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,820
kill people for doing that but American
actors heard about that said

706
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,270
good idea will hack back so that was
kinda hack back

707
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,860
and that sort of pressure in the New Age
now let's roll the clock for

708
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,080
little bit we have capabilities in China
which is now sets with the

709
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,840
fastest-growing major economy in the
world if you're a Chinese hacker

710
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,320
word American you're looking for where
you can define growth in terms of

711
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,790
opportunity for getting stuff

712
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:38,900
go toward china now because of the
economic success

713
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,920
now it's back people are wary does have
some real

714
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,210
serious concerns it is going to say you
know you've got a joke a teacher

715
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,520
kids speak Chinese can talk to their
bosses may grow up

716
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,760
but if you look at the social problems
they have particular with the huge

717
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,650
massive economic disparity between the
Costa Rica to the west

718
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,070
massive emigration going to the city
saying hey we need jobs

719
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:05,420
course you know that male-female ballot
damage

720
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,900
ecologically difficulty in finding fresh
water appears

721
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,260
leadership very very difficult time at
United States

722
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,960
to China potentially try to disrupt the
military command control

723
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,740
disrupt economic development if you
could go ahead

724
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,270
bad into somebody information for
stealing might build

725
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,080
doesn't work US more active worker

726
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,330
but that maybe some solutions that kinda
long lines rethinking

727
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:38,330
okay yessir

728
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:59,789
yup

729
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:17,410
got it the first so quite yet ago follow

730
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,810
the year two thousand I put it this the
system or call it a comeback

731
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,360
talking about yeah I say she created new
military service

732
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,750
for cyber it does not have height and
weight requirements secure with you

733
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,920
Potter not secure with the rover where
have to user

734
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,030
is live on Code Red and Peter

735
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,530
the point is are you you got skills area
while United States so you're in the

736
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,080
response was for the war college

737
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,080
yep thesis is so preposterous it's not
even worth writing

738
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,690
I had to change my piece a subject for
my masters thesis for

739
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,450
up military or college manpower policy
or something

740
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,530
acceptable but this his question was
these old guys are making the policy

741
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,620
without the people together

742
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,620
and that's where the concerns expressed
last year because

743
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,080
for me kinda at the leading edge okay
white won my first

744
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,010
years ago was able to redeem 100 back in
1975 and so

745
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:21,150
I grew up if you will with computer in
cyber is a native language have henry

746
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,990
kissinger remember I was america's

747
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:27,130
boys part for the big German accent or
arnold schwarzenegger as the other

748
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:27,860
Stronach

749
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,620
Austrian accent our senior leadership
wrought with stop

750
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,370
I was probably the leading edge but
again I got tripped up by manpower

751
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,520
policy your tool you can stay

752
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,390
six months before Cyrus stands up I get
flipped off because the old age

753
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:45,490
and I think it might like Moses you know
you're a purifier for four years 1 the

754
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,730
promise land there it is

755
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,160
across for so bad

756
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,110
do it go for it but the danger is that
we're still beholden to a lotta policies

757
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:00,120
yes with the military have height weight
requirement use only four ships run

758
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,940
things like that were missing the point
entirely the other concern that I had

759
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,950
from an organizational perspective Cyber
Command setup

760
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,650
from intelligence agencies logically

761
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:13,710
things like that those always been
mission support

762
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:18,240
and so intelligence support when I was
the director the Joint Operations Centre

763
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,510
for US Pacific

764
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:23,780
like 50 desk job there all ceiling
monitors and

765
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,120
phone with the speed dial white house in
Sector

766
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,930
sprinkle on your back but right to my
right hand side was a guy from the Intel

767
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:37,060
k2 but I'm 3 threes operation so the
commander ever had to fight a war

768
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:41,390
call of the three ops makes warfare
happen now in cyber they don't call for

769
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,130
the call to

770
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,540
to is help give you the intelligence
support

771
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,670
happen trying to pull the trigger so as
a result the fuse

772
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:53,010
2&3 which is kinda misnomer cuz refusing
what

773
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:56,020
to its Intel in it.

774
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:59,700
sarong X Mike

775
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,980
if we wait another twenty eight years or
so will be good because for the last 11

776
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,690
years or so we've been going to the
military academies

777
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:10,920
in creating opportunities to identify
the cadets where the greatest potential

778
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,140
but that we make your career so you have
to keep going back out to see if its

779
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,380
combat tours against

780
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:22,380
sec

781
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,220
in fact what we're finding is the
defense contractors have

782
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:32,090
huge about the capability that we are
the reasons

783
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:35,650
knowledge because in the deal do you
have three basic

784
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,460
categories manpower have uniform report

785
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:44,250
what battling shot back you have the
long-term civilian workforce

786
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,200
may be there for 30 35 you're a longer
career you got the contract

787
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,280
if you look at how you do the work
breakdown structure among those

788
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,480
which you want to do is if somebody has
to pull the trigger or

789
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,040
have high-level accountability they are
beautiful if somebody's going to be the

790
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,810
repository the long-term knowledge in
that organization

791
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,990
abuse but if you've got a skill set that
is either

792
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:08,300
very fleeting or has no longer value
like y2k

793
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,120
call programmers for a while they had a
lady in any way back asking if you want

794
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:12,890
fries with that

795
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:16,800
but you would train military to do that
because you are the contractor

796
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,970
do it if I take a young sailor young
soldier take some

797
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,980
sergeant Center of another become
qualified you know all these initials

798
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,850
after his name

799
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,970
the enemies list many come back if they
want a realist thirty-two thousand

800
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,840
dollars a year

801
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,770
run to go work for some cyber security
company 130 thousand bucks

802
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,400
and one guy who was it Carolina here
last year here

803
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,410
because he said four years the

804
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,770
Marine Corps I career list for about
twenty eight grand or

805
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:47,040
start four thousand dollars it was even
the word

806
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,460
come on it's like a no brainer so yeah

807
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,140
thing is is that your people are going
to be repository in a civilian side

808
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,140
back to the original question of proxy
wars

809
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,830
said back to top the proxy were such
that what we have somebody else try to

810
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,690
work for us

811
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,830
if we have civilians doing or the
Chinese are using the Russian business

812
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:07,710
network and the like

813
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,760
its blurring the distinction from work
fare that was part of the reason the

814
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,570
scalamandre was important because
they're trying to this lead on the

815
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,310
ground rules

816
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:22,310
but we don't think about sorry

817
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,700
lacking awning China Rani United States
are you there

818
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:38,200
which i think is K by way I would

819
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,270
necessarily broad-based judgment Chinese

820
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:47,020
sale you can innovate we say about Japan
right okay

821
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,240
we invent stuff in a mass produce it
however you look at the society

822
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,290
one other things United States really
really worked well was the fact that we

823
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,310
provided

824
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,740
economic incentive for people to develop
intellectual capital

825
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,430
because you came over the idea you you
trade market whatever you could benefit

826
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:03,930
from it

827
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:06,930
if you take that away for the benefit of
the country

828
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,160
look at Soviet Union are the reason
soviet-style

829
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,370
communism failed is that you never got
any rewards for what you create

830
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:17,800
so I would think it's China look North
watch

831
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,810
track Russia pop the clutch install out
the engine

832
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:25,400
trying to go from communism to
capitalism said you know anybody

833
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,700
saying oh really slow and

834
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,270
right after the anchored sentiments were
comes up when they said

835
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,320
Smackdown as otherwise we're gonna lose

836
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:42,320
to numbered outside a right to congress
what can you do

837
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:50,430
all get into the system be able to try
to enforce its African is hiring

838
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:54,800
want to people who don't leadership be
able to demonstrate leadership in your

839
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,030
businesses and your

840
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:59,100
lines at work in your communities by
making sure that your security is

841
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,340
working really really well

842
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,260
help the management the pointy haired
boss is out there the older people

843
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,780
actually

844
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:08,830
the fact that we're inside for free
stage we have to actually

845
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,620
worry about the same and my goal would
be to be able to take people in this

846
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,190
room

847
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,800
here would like to be a CEO or president
a real corporations

848
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,070
alright that's only about 10 percent but
that's enough

849
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,540
because we think differently in hacker
community

850
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,670
look at problems everybody else think
it's conventional and we're gonna go

851
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,100
like week

852
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,170
over here pulled out you get something
that was available

853
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,700
so if we can get to that level said
staying in the

854
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,740
do your security security analysts
security and over security analyst

855
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,980
ultimately see I Sonu heart-stopping
we're talking to Lee question Iran's

856
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,050
so should hunting firms 1990

857
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:52,610
Lee PCSOs everything CIO 100 years ago
business

858
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:57,120
stop

859
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,970
so gotta get out back career track is
otherwise would be

860
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,110
all people issuing orders with the
orders are being issued rock

861
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,890
ASI got time for one more okay your

862
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:14,890
one do

863
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:27,340
People's Liberation Army yes okay thanks
for your help

864
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,119
or crux

865
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:41,339
I don't know

866
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:44,450
I don't know enough about the answer
that question his favored

867
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:48,559
your was senior leadership and the his
party in the People's Republic of China

868
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,880
seem to be scientists and engineers with
United States

869
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,970
politicians lawyers and things like that
I don't know enough about the background

870
00:54:54,970 --> 00:55:01,970
Chinese answered

871
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:19,500
right

872
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,180
your back to the problem his question
was what if instead of worrying about

873
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,320
espionage in economic game for people
staring

874
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,630
secretive value that make it so it's not
worth anything steel

875
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:00,300
then you go back from how do we were the
innovators because then you should I say

876
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,520
I don't care how much innovation

877
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,830
come up with a boy who are you same the
open-source argument

878
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,119
very happy open source what other people
say hey you know you get paid for my

879
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:08,869
time and effort

880
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:15,869
well fight Saturday 30 my money from why
we can't put it any more anymore the

881
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:23,250
same way we did because now we see

882
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,599
copies brings you know that seriously
latter

883
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:30,980
so well bottom line is that when we face
we're facing your work there's no clean

884
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,750
solutions

885
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,660
gotta go ahead next for that we got
influencer decision makers both

886
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,490
political

887
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,599
well corporate international diplomats
and the like

888
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:41,589
we've got a challenge ahead of ourselves
is going to be evolving over the next

889
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:42,690
two years you're gonna live

890
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,880
interesting Chinese occurs

891
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,560
thank you very much
