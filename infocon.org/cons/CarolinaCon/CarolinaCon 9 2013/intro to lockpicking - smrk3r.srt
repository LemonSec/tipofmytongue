taste is an adaptation of the through
ball thing

27
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,649
basically it's an excuse to drink during
talks what you do is you

28
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,880
the presenter will prepare the drink of
his choosing explain it probably has

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,439
some sort

30
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,229

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,160

79
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,490

83
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,700
find out who I work for

84
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,630

86
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,600
if you find my picture on our website hi

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,919
which they actually maybe borrow from
another coworker cuz I sure hope for

88
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,169
picture day without it I

89
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,680
world so we meet regularly to drink

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,360
and look at locks we have a lot to locks
level out tomorrow

91
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,210
we do attempt to remove security from
physical security you heard these talks

92
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:06,930
before there's

93
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,120
a lotta around locksmithing

94
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,620
and there's a lot of secrecy that I
don't think should be there I think free

95
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,380
and open information is a good thing
especially when you're making decisions

96
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,900
about how to secure your things

97
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,760
have all over cool

98
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,150
we drunk good

99
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:32,150
the other disclaimer here is we don't
necessarily condone

100
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,210
illegal activities based with that means
if you own a dupe

101
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,220
I again this may or may not be North
Korea's they may or may not have

102
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,520
lonesome missiles around the day so if
you may or may not find some walls this

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,060
weekend in the IP range I may or may not
have a price for you

104
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,210

106
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,039
we're going to talk about Penn summer
walk through the hallway for locks we're

107
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,560
gonna talk a little bit about handcuffs

108
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,909
by honestly it's intro on my talk now
high-security locks here so

109
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:10,099
if you thought that was what you're
going for I'm very sorry

110
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:13,169
I will not give your money back so

111
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,409
why do looks matter if I get to a
shooting at work of like this

112
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:21,249
one of those it means I'm winning

113
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:25,199
I that guy's not comment I'm really
sorry consequences will never be the

114
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,689
same

115
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,959
but rights I got no thats cyber

116
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,129
I'm sorry I

117
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,219
I grew up in the wrong decade apparently

118
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:40,509
for all this Cyberabad because I get all
excited so it's like itself every time I

119
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,159
see site there's that

120
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,299
that that's a real Issa Doral thing
right at all

121
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:55,579
alright so just keep going been
somewhere locks even drinks our sister

122
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,029
in

123
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:59,149
pencil water everywhere

124
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:03,879
there on anything you see most walk
implementations arpan summer locks

125
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,799
I was in the US they haven't really
changed a lot about a hundred fifty

126
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,329
years

127
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,669
they're very easy to manufacture put
together which means there's a decreased

128
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,789
cost for production as far as the vendor
manufactures concern

129
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,029
by that means they get the market up
like crazy

130
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:25,179
which in turn means they might sell you
a lot increased picking security

131
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:28,889
annual Open 32nd so just because it cost
sixty dollars doesn't mean it's going to

132
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:29,899
keep anybody out

133
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:33,680
that is what she said that's what others

134
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,979
so here's a basic assembly

135
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,389
this is carava blown-up thing we made

136
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:45,540
racism terms around a lot in other
contexts as well

137
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,920
driver Penske pens and Springs the top
10

138
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,300
that's known as the pen stack to walk
works really that's why those pins move

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,490
up and down on the springs

140
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,290
inside this thing called the Bible have
no idea why that's the case

141
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,939
I pick in a row

142
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:07,290
the Word of God award

143
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,839
Word of God werd have some fun

144
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,949
some religion in Salt Pond on one that's
worth

145
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,569
box alright you get the housing you have
the key where you have the plug all

146
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:20,230
these things go together there's a pin
tumbler

147
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,629
make sense yep sometimes

148
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:30,579
very keep is generally are the ones that
are

149
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,000
different heights we'll see in a bit I'm
there is some differences in the driver

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,120
and especially if you're looking at
master keying stations

151
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,089
fight I see another about yessir II

152
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:48,110
say about they back alright so I Q

153
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,429
for I those value in the and traditions
Penn sitting at rest prevent the board

154
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,130
from turning

155
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,220
so the walk stays close that's basically
all there is to it in somewhere lock

156
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,220
oh absolutely so in the Pens are at rest

157
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,259
years this year line all of these driver
pins are blocking that's your line two

158
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:06,790
view

159
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,230
tried rotate lock without the Kenyan it
won't turn

160
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,679
because all those pens are binding
that's your the keys are cut to specific

161
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,269
Heights

162
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:18,410
correlate to the heights each pay with
the correct

163
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,660
in raises all those keys to the
preconfigured at the shoreline

164
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,759
allows the plug to rotate opens law that

165
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,459
basically how what works there are a lot
of different variants on that here and

166
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,050
there but for the most part

167
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,720
that's it now this is a nice little

168
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,910
if you're with what may or may not be
north korea's eyepiece get

169
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,860
but this is essentially a cutaway this
this made the rounds on

170
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,730
several sites I think I finally found
one time were once told us get I am

171
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,910
but that's basically how is a six pin
lock but that's what goes on we see the

172
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,620
key on their

173
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,910
with all those for your lineup lock
basically stick

174
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,300
so what we're doing here is

175
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,429
exploiting something related to the
manufacturing process

176
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,540
so in an ideal world the perfect world
all the components would be

177
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,679
very precisely mill they would be very
highly resistant to weather

178
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,759
and wear and tear those sort of things
and

179
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,829
that would result in all the pins
finding something easily

180
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,170
that would not necessarily remove the
vulnerability we exploit would certainly

181
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,139
make it more difficult

182
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:26,370
and some hiring walk some better locks
in fact do

183
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:33,370
right do do things better if

184
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,839
to the Holy Bible

185
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,430
award of God's Holy Bible this is what

186
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,420
this is what the Bible actually looks
like these guys have nice little let's

187
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,230
cut out a home

188
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,290
I considering that we're working with
very small tolerances

189
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,130
she said 2007 inch difference does
matter

190
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,680
that's what she said the plot what
similarly as well that has a nice gash

191
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,140
in it

192
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,640
that is also said and the Pistons look
pretty rough to

193
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,620
have a difficult time sliding in and out
the Bible what's if you're into that

194
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:20,020
what that causes when you attempt to
rotate the blog

195
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,420
generally one of those pins will bind
first

196
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,060
Korea we have some were

197
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,290
woodstock yeah possible which sorry
about the

198
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,940
water I figured if it many would be
plenty

199
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,940
sorry hose kit was well made

200
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,790
so this'll I'm sorry too much larger

201
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,810
heather's what's up we go get em

202
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,890
lady Joe so

203
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,900
what we do is we take we take it
attention right sticks to tools by the

204
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,230
way outside if you ever see

205
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,230
you're a TV show where they're using 12

206
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,440
some switched wheel around

207
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,420
one works not a lot that's what it takes
to

208
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,790
in

209
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,120
yeah in certain tension wrench either
top or the bottom

210
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,440
you insert the pic and what you do you
still you start hunting for that pen

211
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,130
that's binding

212
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,170
you put very light consistent tension on
that drive on the

213
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,910
cylinder and as it's attempting to turn
it will turn just so much that one of

214
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,170
those pins Bynes

215
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,440
and you can set that pit because we're
working with thousands evidence

216
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,440
tolerance it'll stay up and the move on
to the next

217
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,680
little davis also they are they don't
need

218
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,110
bills already very light tension

219
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,070
get to the point where you start to feel
it pushed back you know you're doing it

220
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,670
just right

221
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,100
that's not about luck so

222
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,120
I was gonna do it demo but have no idea
what time it is

223
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,740
I'm fine

224
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:16,160
only five minutes right what yes what
I'm gonna do actually

225
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,700
I'm gonna take a tensor I'm a put in the
bottom and I might take

226
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,870
put it in just do around a little bit I
should

227
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:31,529
way know almost there

228
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,250
there over got dot that's all it takes
if you wanted the president takes a

229
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,330
little bit longer but

230
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,240
SARS mmm

231
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,300
I love you try this is another 1i was
gonna

232
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,130
attempt the pic that was a lot of an ass
but I'm just into the right

233
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,290
a bit about the tools

234
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,700
what's if

235
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,500
it's okay to have a curve to lock nobody
will make

236
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,950
they will make any around the corner
jokes a good life for some people and

237
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,700
they're all kinds different or
configurations TV it actually has a

238
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,050
really good talk but I seem to a couple
times on

239
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,250
just about la pics with the use for what
sort of

240
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,220
what sort for

241
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,040
use on unitard talk on this

242
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,580
really all you need something a bit like
this

243
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,610
may be a bit like this if you wanna
really work something like this

244
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,360
really something we'll point on it
because what you're doing using getting

245
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,890
there

246
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,900
work it I set it up so

247
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,980
Lake I this thing like

248
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,980
IQ of feel

249
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,089
but you're in there you're trying to
work those pens you raise them up to the

250
00:15:59,089 --> 00:15:59,660
shoreline

251
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,350
bill Sutton Place and the new just gone

252
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,910
it will open work with tensioning is the
key to successful are picking

253
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,360
that's my only written upon tinting
really is the important thing a lot of

254
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,870
times when people first start picking

255
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,420
they think it takes a lot more tension
that it does honestly

256
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,170
you can take tensioner put in the bottom
of the keyway

257
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,480
just starting out and the amount wat
tensioner itself provides is usually

258
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,149
enough turning forced open that law

259
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,320
so if you can simply use your finger to
their without appropriate tensions stay

260
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,290
with the fines

261
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,480
it's working II

262
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,870
but he's very light engine if your
fingers for changing colors aren't

263
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,339
Stewart so very gentle

264
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,820
take it easy with the pick itself a
different ball game

265
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,209
tensioning has to be very gentle up

266
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:56,100
so how can we fix this fall

267
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,250
whether the couple quick ways you can do
it if you have bad lots of

268
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,420
example to a lot of people ask me after
talks like these when

269
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,350
housewife double glass back doors 15

270
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,110
a quick my snuggle pic of pro

271
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,809
they're gonna pick up a chair of my deck
and throw it through the door

272
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:18,220
him federal lockup weaker point

273
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,490
to worry about yet also a while the
stakeout

274
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,799
Elise is known as quick set that you can

275
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,900
that they

276
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,410
they don't like your so like completely
asylum office now

277
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,549
your UNC Charlotte we were there

278
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,890
fall and there was a actually a quick
sec Rep there the day we were doing our

279
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,280
stuff you know we were gonna be there

280
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,200
any we have fun but he

281
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,850
he honestly did not know about the
quickset

282
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,890
the the the res with call

283
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:58,890
the key the rekeying marquee thank you
yeah marquee

284
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,669
is a differently designed lock it allows
you to

285
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:07,940
rekey with just a tool the master key

286
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,630
on deviant again props he's got plenty
to drink right now

287
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:18,450
doesn't you are mine job

288
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,909
his ex got a great video where he took
its magical

289
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:25,700
and open it up and that would still work
right like when you're done

290
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,110
store yet so and it doesn't work when
you go to change the lock

291
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,450
point but like you can have repeated
injury with that too

292
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,110
technically not required up but

293
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,360
but honestly this guy did never and he
was like we had this competition

294
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,159
will nearly as destructive you load

295
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,940
plastic in your walk was or

296
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,940
why is that okay because destructive
entry

297
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,309
you put you be rich in 3d printing a law

298
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:01,390
no cool so the key ways

299
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,080
others are some things you can't change
you can make them look a little bit more

300
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,860
complicated

301
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,400
you can change the plans do really are a
way for locks

302
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,150
there also they might be the worst luck
ever

303
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,419
I have look at one side cried

304
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:24,150
thats not this is my desk

305
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,299
Mike on mark that's my car shopping

306
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,540
open Michael

307
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,250
the part of my way it's gonna it's gonna
try force

308
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,940
on of fact I for it's got some up there

309
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,290
a savior attacking the lock on a car
you're breaking

310
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,630
different ot I will

311
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,100
because this is not a vendor Connell
read name you can read it

312
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,530
markets came in this picture those are
that's a short span see

313
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:04,530
cued up your hospital I mean you kick it

314
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:11,179
points right

315
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:16,220
this I this came into my filing cabinet
life was like

316
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,019
why do you think telephone companyus I
need takes a picture for my talk to put

317
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:20,559
it back in

318
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,799
like this is like two years ago not back
in it's like

319
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,889
I I think it's in my bag honestly

320
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:31,119
she puts up I am

321
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,279
but with a lot worse or the same
principles you have these

322
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,659
set up engine wafers in their spring
loaded and they pushed

323
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:41,059
different directions that people of
turning you entered the correct key

324
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,679
and it will just all those waivers the
correct Heights

325
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,710
allied oh we have a

326
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,499
IQ we feel like appears great technique

327
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:56,210
it is effective

328
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,039
really anything with the bumper curves
this is where curved tools

329
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,340
comes gonna work

330
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,429
I honestly these things all over really
quickly

331
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:11,969
just the tip we're going to get to that
there's actually a perfect for that

332
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:16,149
is wait for it it's going real soon a
lobbyist now

333
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,159
I love these men to Issa half the rooms

334
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,509
of

335
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:26,349
0 I didn't talk about to get out so what
you can do

336
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:31,259
you can do it over lifting attack you
can do this with either a blankie or

337
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:31,779
something

338
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:35,099
with a popsicle stick and you can stick

339
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,639
in the way for a lot all the way and
twisted poured out very slowly

340
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:43,109
and those wafers will actually get
caught on the outside edges then you can

341
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:43,979
take the pic

342
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:50,119
the tip take a tip for the possible
stick to the Dept and open it

343
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,669
because this wafers will stay in place
scholarly

344
00:21:53,669 --> 00:22:00,669
padlocks earthing

345
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,990
that's the thing

346
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,870
you can decode combination locks

347
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,290
you consume them IQ

348
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,280
civil to make them more expensive than
they ought to be buying the process

349
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,760
ahead

350
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,700
diets as fuck you America doing

351
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,929
and I will make its you

352
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,960
so you got a bit of a square

353
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,980
you make it look like that you folded up
so it looks like that stick one on one

354
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,580
side

355
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,269
on the other side it was time around
opens up as a great party trick

356
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:42,490
we like doing this a conference is to
see how many people cut themselves

357
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,529
and make bottom

358
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:49,159
I its just what we do

359
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,990
sorry like to know what you get anybody
could come to a failed me

360
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,379
once lots of people have come one time

361
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:01,169
if because this faith

362
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,240
I thought just as much there its

363
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,769
it's good I you can fix those with some
pain traps if you wanna put

364
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:12,600
jack up your with that here

365
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,860
was a ball bearings that things got
mechanism

366
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:22,860
whatever these appointees I we thought
handcuffs too

367
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,420
I don't really like monkeys their

368
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm kinda about personality disorder
becomes a monkey's one-sided me says

369
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,530
see responsibility needs to be discussed

370
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,170
those on the set she got WAY over I
iraq's a lock

371
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:47,150
so like if you have some monkeys and you
want to test list of

372
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,280
free file need to be opens a lock
awesome

373
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,690
by it might not open it five times

374
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,980
because you might break it so be be
aware that if you wanna start pumping

375
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,390
things

376
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,060
basically Bakkies work by taking the
bidding which is the key cuts

377
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,180
cutting them all the way to the lower
approach a couple a method to doing that

378
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,360
basically use the commenting

379
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,450
water and intention pretty quickly

380
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,810
it is effective it does leave a mark no
it's not forensics perspective it

381
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,460
really does a number on locks internals

382
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,340
work now make some it is noisy

383
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,590
yet I mean you

384
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,090
you smack Europe into you're barking you
need to get a different job

385
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,640
pro tip I

386
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,060
you're trying to break into a bank
barking enjoy your headshot

387
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,640
take aloe Alec

388
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,880
it just isn't really practical a lot of
areas it can be really quick cuz like

389
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,170
I all admit this I know I have a bias
hey

390
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,210
and unreasonable smokey's liked so much
to the extent that I decided we're going

391
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,120
to some contested me one night

392
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,410
with this guy who had pic before

393
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,050
pic we never bought before and I was
gonna give them a mass walked three in a

394
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,820
bulky

395
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,030
I put on a pair of handcuffs and I was
gonna pick the lock handcuffs before he

396
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,420
could

397
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,780
block in like were like re: go LED

398
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,690
tenses up the right up this is the flu

399
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,000
sewing it again over the ride

400
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,080
so pokey

401
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,600
works I just I handcuffs are fun

402
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,180
have another high Q here for a
disclaimer escaping is not recommended

403
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,630
approach

404
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,600
if the police are there you will get
curb stomped

405
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,370
are a bargain and Gus are they were

406
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,960
Merkel's of our abilities exist
basically there are a couple more

407
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,520
abilities

408
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,430
thank us because we have this
spring-loaded lever

409
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:56,770
you can either go through the keyway and

410
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,090
if you like that which is what you see
people do when they're picking handcuffs

411
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,290
or you can completely disengaged that
all the way by inserting a shame

412
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,020
from either side have deviance gets here
do

413
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,250
we disengaging will

414
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:19,150
start I'll do this

415
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,930
this is this is where I can I

416
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,580
there are features in place to prevent
this by

417
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,640
their waste as well delightful

418
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,140
Cup metal you can use a tensioner want
them enough but we actually

419
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,640
buy these from a place and make some
force you slide

420
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,570
and you behind your back

421
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,870
you can you do behind your back front
again if a cop put you in these

422
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:53,050
don't recommend and most cops

423
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:58,010
for mark know about this

424
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,410
North

425
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,060
North Korea may or may not like they
probably

426
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,250
found those in the unicorn game in a
valid about seeming that way

427
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,480
that might be with actually found
unicorn but sim

428
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,270
several mentions an interesting
interesting topic what I have here to

429
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,720
you

430
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,280
standard police issue coughs I for the
one saying police force

431
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,400
basically a pic whichever ones they get
for their new recruits

432
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,520
based on which one will sell them the
cheapest so there's not like any real

433
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,080
security considerations going on

434
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,290
restraints are assistance there there an
effort to get these officers

435
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:41,340
up they're not themselves forestry so
they know that

436
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,010
generally watch for people who are
attempting to escape

437
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:51,470
one over on this sir this is a Smith and
Wesson

438
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,060
and 100 this is a peerless your 10

439
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,600
you can already see if later okay
massive gap here

440
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,170
that is not here now I just him the
peerless I have this button wasn't

441
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:03,860
somewhere

442
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,440
so it's a little bit easier to ship
these because there's a little bit more

443
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,750
word hallway job by

444
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,990
it's still possible to shoot non RR

445
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,430
heroes so there's not a whole lot going
on there

446
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:24,430
on the other hand where did

447
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,160
the other hand there's a a wonderful
company

448
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,600
Korea cool populace is also

449
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,160
Korea this you make some really nice
think of these are

450
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,340
now they're very white if you like toys

451
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,250
you getting these without a key

452
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,450
and RR you will have to cut yourself

453
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:53,450
have berkes as you can see

454
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,570
these have a nice little bar and that
runs the full length

455
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,830
are the Paul so that you can get

456
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,600
a single I've played around with trying
to dribble

457
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,850
slot much and

458
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:13,820
I her I did it was that

459
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,920
I didn't believe it I felt so quick

460
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,140
I don't really like pain I think here

461
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,380
now but there's just not a lot during
the work with I could probably

462
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,930
figure out a way to do that but out the
bad these rules are better off

463
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,410
I again they

464
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,760
aren't going to be issued in North
Carolina

465
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,410
there on the issue North Carolina I know
in winston-salem

466
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,550
police officers cannot carry cost that
don't take a standard

467
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,270
key so they can upgrade after the fact
be on their police issue well I think

468
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,780
technically not supposed to

469
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,850
but the the rule on the books is your
casa

470
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,070
take a stand key these jewels actually
don't in addition to this whole being

471
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,790
split

472
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,100
they do you have a split key as well

473
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,810
flights not all did some great work
couple years ago

474
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,180
and they figured out that you can take a
standard Smith & Wesson

475
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,140
and runaway slave in and it will open
these

476
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,210
so that's pretty universal handcuff
agree

477
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,270
research they very appreciative for that

478
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:23,610
that knowledge but other companies have
attempted to do this

479
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:30,610
ASP as Pecos here they are

480
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,570
they actually do this a split

481
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,000
ratchet so on the inside

482
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,790
lock handcuff maker each

483
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,990
one of those guys can be spring-loaded
so what you have here is a single

484
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,960
Singapore ideal and

485
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,030
you can actually split this guy out make
multiple

486
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,500
levers who has to you appear

487
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,070
have three but the ASPCA do anything to
keep

488
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,360
shipment and it's a standard d so

489
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,390
K it's just leonard

490
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:17,390
