1
00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:03,280
incident manager for that be search

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,500
three months is for the ones that
actually published on the woman

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,369
oblivious regarding cisco products and
sometimes in

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:10,940
industry-wide events

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,949
but at any rate

6
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:14,099
i want to talk about

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,970
only but needs here today when i wanna
talk about is actually how

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,880
devolution of not worse acutely

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,719
has happened in the last several years
and also how networks are still getting

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,359
hacked

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,610
that peace and on long retailers

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,840
so it will be here for ten years

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,730
if i come up with all the reasons i'm at
work still get packed and even if you

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,500
have are also might be s and everything
else in the world

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,120
used to going on

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,950
i'm gonna try to summarize before
actually has happened actually meet even

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,910
interest in the oven until yesterday

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,600
regarding network security

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,070
again in august he he's set a strong
work he says you know a lot of awesome

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,960
person there are some modern awesome
percent the slums of your expectations

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,100
but now

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,420
and their first thing that i do is such
a steal

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,110
videos from older people and then that
will take a two or three minutes at a

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,260
time for my presentation so my
presentation the need is like

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,370
two seconds

26
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,140
but it

27
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,860
actually want to start with a video here

28
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,070
that it was i think that uh... it's a
cisco but it was not anything related to

29
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,930
to win

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,860
to product

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,150
is just like you to remind us about the
actual

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:33,150
evolution of nor security volition of
networks circle

33
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:36,719
it was pretty realistic everything so
these are not that there is no comment

34
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,999
airways actually have with me at my
replacement

35
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,359
my son is sixteen years old reading also

36
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,759
programming python though the rhythm
principles plus is going to see this is

37
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,179
c_n_n_ certification

38
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,339
but uh... it

39
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,370
uh... yeah

40
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,899
i asked him they do you know what is
actually this visit this place

41
00:03:55,899 --> 00:04:02,899
day

42
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,809
twenty-fifth

43
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:14,829
i would like to read it

44
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:16,389
so it

45
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,829
back in the days

46
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:21,759
we consider that they have to be
complicated right so it was

47
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,539
breathe and you see

48
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,419
right so networks up actually evolved

49
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,879
from simple diagrams like this

50
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,919
they got bigger

51
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,939
or something like that

52
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,210
but then they got it and i'll be here

53
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,680
and they got a lot bigger

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,830
and they continued to grow

55
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,280
so add

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,409
then after they continued to grow we
start getting personalized whom i dot

57
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:45,139
virtualization we started making
companies to actually do this week

58
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,270
started makin open-source tools to the
virtualisation

59
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,440
we start of the clout

60
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,639
or the clouds the private the hybrid

61
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,159
that whatever you want to call the tune
up

62
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,260
and a m

63
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,190
now would you have

64
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,699
the level of complexity rising just
dramatically

65
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,659
and a lot of people who were actually
thinking okay so we're is this going to

66
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:06,460
get it right

67
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,189
so if i go back to you know so force we
have bmc here

68
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,889
early supporter but

69
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,529
without begins

70
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:14,699
or traffic

71
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,570
it's actually passing the not leaving
the same box

72
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,699
last year when i was there something
here

73
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,370
though such a program of the complexity
of the networks and how people if you're

74
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,039
still getting or doing stupid things and

75
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,040
where trying you know their best for the
you know

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,189
to secure the technology action not
helping

77
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,399
and even if we get

78
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,889
as some clever

79
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,340
never ways so

80
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,710
uh... protecting

81
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,210
is still getting bypass

82
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,899
rights of the complexities actually one
of the things you know one of the

83
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:41,999
reasons

84
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,860
of why do we get

85
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,939
you know fails all over the place right

86
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,090
even outside of that

87
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,590
the problem that we have right now

88
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,559
it's even

89
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,639
we went with a political that that we
have right now it is that

90
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,879
would even be fine

91
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,870
we don't even know

92
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,669
where they doubt this is right now we
have the and need to any problem right

93
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:05,580
so

94
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,419
one-plus as my data from anywhere

95
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,309
i want to acts as a from any device

96
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:15,259
i want to access the data at whatever
time i want

97
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:16,349
not only that but

98
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,300
that way that i wanted to the data that
i want and the data can be stored in any

99
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,910
place

100
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,990
unity out

101
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,949
in any data center you don't even know

102
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:28,900
so back complexities adding a lot

103
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,550
the security dilemma

104
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,759
there right now

105
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,400
this is also out to be adding

106
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,629
and a lot of it not only to security
itself

107
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,889
bud powell

108
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:40,459
things are actually changing very
dramatically

109
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,909
so before

110
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:46,979
you needed the large corporation like
unlike epic in mind this is the only one

111
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:51,069
that outbreak that could become is a
cisco right so all we know that that she

112
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,049
can create the movies robertson switches
and they can create their own

113
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,059
infrastructure to provide services

114
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,649
but right now actually have to various

115
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,269
you get a creek park

116
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,319
elect health services

117
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,430
and that's all you need

118
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,990
you just did a great part like you to
meet some basic needs

119
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,930
and outsourcing

120
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,430
candidate outsource his job to china
sold india whatever

121
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,249
so that that's all you need right

122
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:19,679
now that's that's what people are
actually are facing right now is that

123
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,379
people are buying stuff

124
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,749
unsubscribing to services that are
literally run by two very separate part

125
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:31,289
which is such a abdominal ok that's i'm
all for that time

126
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:32,719
which they can be that too

127
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,809
the guy with a great card i can provide
that service

128
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,800
but in some cases you know

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,919
they're probably not thinking so much
about security

130
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,849
and that would trust in them with in on
specific services

131
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:44,789
but at any rate

132
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,199
that probably actually

133
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,449
kicking ass

134
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:49,959
that you think you more about sick you
did on the other

135
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,650
you know providers are actually doing
some well everything's

136
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,120
sobil but just wanted to bring thinks
that the perspective before actually

137
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,009
jump

138
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,360
more into the

139
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,210
the address the presentation

140
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,319
motherwell of talking about two guys in
a great part

141
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,710
that's saying the glamour

142
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,449
or that same principle is actually being
used

143
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:09,759
right now

144
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,830
but industry and

145
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,060
older people

146
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,899
were i can rent the whole bunch machines

147
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,219
i can create makeup services

148
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:20,069
and i can also

149
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,360
the in a book fire some financial
institutions like amplifiers of whatever

150
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,259
i can even at ac i can't even use that
landscape

151
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,470
asana fact

152
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,070
to close on damage

153
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,149
so as not only that the dilemma all
things that the complexity and and an

154
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,579
now the flexibility of

155
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:39,520
you're running a service from anywhere

156
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,810
we're creating ui

157
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,870
picked up service bus actually

158
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,190
able to use that

159
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,390
how much you're not going dot sh on that
a little bit later in the presentations

160
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,110
on the table it for now

161
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,190
but what else is actually changing

162
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,900
it right now

163
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,800
even jobs

164
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,210
even the things that are fundamentals
for austin we need to make money right

165
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,150
so

166
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,090
we don't have

167
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,210
this job school social media marketers
before

168
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,890
who will not you know that somebody's
shelbyville

169
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,430
social media market

170
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,470
who will let you know that you you
needed

171
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,019
scientists to achieve humble beginnings
act that way that we have to housing

172
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:16,800
right now

173
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,029
who watching though

174
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,680
that you need at their degree black belt
in sick if you need a cyber wire your in

175
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,120
order to much to protect the network

176
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,530
i mean this jobs

177
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,700
if there are made up

178
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,040
or actually that

179
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,700
you never thought that that was just

180
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,000
there right now or in in this ages

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,240
we'll have all these buzzwords you'll be
whale d_s_p_ n

182
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,649
it one of the things this is not

183
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,890
news to you

184
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,850
actually

185
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,760
gotta bring things into perspective

186
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,170
you know all those buzzwords are there

187
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,120
but a m

188
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,350
but if you think about it

189
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,210
that's what we don't know any of the

190
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,950
that young guys like

191
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,250
there again here in sixteen years old or
the nineteen-year-old

192
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,500
that she wants

193
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,670
they want you know they need they need
the flexibility

194
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,520
i'm not saying that all square actually
now in a bit more than the slower

195
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,000
but they don't need the flexibility of
their asking for the flexibility

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,880
but they're not thinking so much about
security in many many cases right

197
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,850
brings that dilemma also

198
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,840
of our city

199
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,430
you know it

200
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,000
bringing your own devised wherever you
go to hell you want to let you go

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,879
by the same time

202
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,359
not even thinking that refer questions
of that sebastian doesn't have the

203
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,940
ability of facing

204
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,830
it right now

205
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,120
but what else

206
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,370
we have this thing

207
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,180
it within the industry

208
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,590
holding turner everything well
everything is that you gotta be

209
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,640
connected

210
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,970
sasha taking place right now and forgot
what this is going over there for a

211
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,440
second i'm going to be

212
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,140
fiscal condition but

213
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,240
it is true i mean over ninety percent of
things right now they're not connected

214
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,520
to something

215
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,750
right now and i can show you some
examples we are trying to connect

216
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,810
everything

217
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,400
to a network

218
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,750
admin

219
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,760
these actually constituted

220
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,600
bigger problems that we could have
before we have

221
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,250
people-to-people communication

222
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,100
people permission communications and but
the machine

223
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,250
but not much use after talking to each
other

224
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,180
but need to

225
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,910
actually built processes around that

226
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,670
and to make sure that not only will
understand

227
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,800
the complexity

228
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,930
in the network

229
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,940
but that we also understand the security
ramifications of that

230
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,260
so is there any political problem that i
mentioned before

231
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,020
aware

232
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,920
anything to be talking to anything

233
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,110
from anywhere

234
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,570
uh... data can be exchanged in a candy
store from any clout

235
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,750
in any that i sent them

236
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,040
uh... anyway

237
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,050
anyways

238
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,470
but this is actually not only a new
trend and alumni don't keep talking

239
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,269
about these things though we know

240
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:54,670
statements of one devices i was in that

241
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,870
is old news

242
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,249
mausam up talking about

243
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:01,539
in a smart to be some problems on the
hubble could be used and you know

244
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:05,240
video games and boom glasses you know
i'm not actually dot i love that

245
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,340
talking about that

246
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,880
now it is expected

247
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,879
that things

248
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,870
in the home will be connected

249
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,260
that some sort of course will be you
know we all know what's gonna

250
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,730
things that's fundamental as this one
company no

251
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,550
of you know what

252
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,010
this thing is

253
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,820
how many only

254
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,000
sick they go

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,510
that's uh... it's cold and asked

256
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,180
it's actually

257
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,470
rhythm who right so you can actually

258
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,740
based on your behavior in the housing

259
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,110
set your temperature

260
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,350
and it actually learns

261
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,220
as a moderate on such and there's a
pattern is an automatically speculates

262
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,949
that he

263
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:42,670
or a good

264
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,870
or they see of your house

265
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,320
that is correct of course the network

266
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,440
how many of you know what

267
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,350
the few leads

268
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,630
coming to use it

269
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,500
local here asap

270
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,289
so that

271
00:12:55,289 --> 00:13:01,340
and active until eight out of you so
much

272
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,970
it is

273
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,530
nike came up with you soon

274
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,190
who banned pedagogy

275
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,690
you know keeps track of indo-european
detail it periodicals eulogy new graphic

276
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,510
next to the clout in that she tells you
a pure

277
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,170
you're not doing dumb much of exercise
like me or yet you doing too much

278
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,220
how many of you knows what this is

279
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,810
yeah there you go

280
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:30,100
what do you support

281
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,670
so how many on you don't know what that
is buddies

282
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,920
the rasberry pipe

283
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,440
sat twenty five dollars

284
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,380
you know depend on the module or the
model

285
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,430
they've been positive incomplete for
those like fifty dollars

286
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,660
i made you come do whatever with it

287
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,870
the as a matter of fact right now are
much cheaper

288
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,570
thinking about building

289
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,830
up against the owner of the house

290
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,470
smarthome technology

291
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,190
transfer the information over the the
wires or was that you know they're

292
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,500
worried about growing up without it
anymore but

293
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,960
solo story

294
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,990
that end i think you know you can put
limits on it you can put whatever

295
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,380
processed them you know that will of
course will fit in there

296
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,950
will have a nasty cartman

297
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,940
newborn you express

298
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,140
where we want to call it

299
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,780
so all these things actually bit getting
connected right now

300
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,080
an expected to be connected i want them
to be connected

301
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,880
dubs accusers

302
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,360
becomes with a greater

303
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,300
at risk and you know we have to keep
that in mind and i'll talk

304
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,980
more about it

305
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,080
later how many of you

306
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,100
sdn

307
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,890
lesbian stands for

308
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:50,890
how many of you have to use it right now

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,290
all right so

310
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,160
software defined networks basic
definitions some that are going to have

311
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,170
a bunch of things and you cannot even
read it so

312
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,040
put it

313
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,110
the ability to networks are becoming
more probable

314
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,450
that should become a personalized

315
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,439
coming more

316
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:11,910
program levels and personalized and
flexible

317
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,500
and things of that but i think that
actually there are two things that are

318
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,510
risks

319
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,480
with security on those things and also
there are opportunities

320
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,900
into the fact that

321
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,150
unit unit u_n_ you have more things that
can talk to each other

322
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,350
you can deploy things faster

323
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,940
can deploy hope apology within a matter
of minutes that will take

324
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,740
somebody

325
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,750
you know based months or years uh...
sometimes

326
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,280
so it has a lot of potential

327
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,380
and there's money but not least wanna
talk about the whole sdn architecture

328
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,230
here but

329
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,480
you know that this

330
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,870
open-source

331
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,420
is technologies available

332
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,680
lycopene flow

333
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,260
that is allowing people

334
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,700
biblical it is such a pretty rapidly

335
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,370
within their symptoms

336
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,900
now one other thing says that

337
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,100
as the impasse

338
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,750
the concept of a controller

339
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,800
the secured implication of the
controller is that

340
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,040
failure

341
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,900
there or if

342
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,540
if the controller gets

343
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,720
compromise

344
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,250
of course all bets are off because of us
of your own

345
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,960
virtual network

346
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,120
compromise

347
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,760
such as something

348
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,170
people

349
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,230
that people still

350
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,950
try to pay attention to

351
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,460
but i wonder how actually sucessful we
actually have a

352
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,279
protecting

353
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,480
that infrastructure

354
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,290
specially whenever you have no

355
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,210
up with that additional eight-year-old
applications in there

356
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,410
you have that control module here

357
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,770
and then all the physical

358
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,040
then partially prepared for such a
device is our network devices or on

359
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,880
their needs

360
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,439
you can actually possible walked

361
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,710
of damage

362
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,770
but i'm going to a lot of the till so
lesbian as well but uh... this is just

363
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,170
another visualization of how

364
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,050
espionage he works

365
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,150
from the moment of orchestration

366
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,810
all the way to the deployment of

367
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,590
over pretensions

368
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,329
but it

369
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:03,279
again i have to talk about the whole
bunch of buzzwords in on

370
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,710
lot of the march is not new to you

371
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,950
you know you prolly don't care

372
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,770
some of them

373
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,120
what i want to know

374
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,700
highlight again is that

375
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,850
right now all this publicity or this box
works on everything

376
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,449
didactic management

377
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,739
it's always asking ok is my network
ready enough and i deploy sdn thank the

378
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:23,870
gentleman here

379
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,120
kanye become more ritualized and i
actually have it

380
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,810
at hybrid cloud or actually have a
private company

381
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,680
hit that some services outside

382
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,930
so cold out

383
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,760
uh... complexity

384
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,490
it's actually

385
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,030
prominent to place into the idea
management side of the house

386
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,810
well for us to set this the security and
staff

387
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,850
how

388
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,900
and i act so my network and be secure

389
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,740
this is actually coming from cisco
houston usa

390
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,420
senior manager within that idea for a
structure

391
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,120
wendy

392
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,490
sick you gettin such as cisco

393
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,880
from the

394
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,650
incident response item

395
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,130
course we sell products

396
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,530
from that research side of the house on
everything

397
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,090
camp probably say that a lot of people
are

398
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,570
concern about security within cisco
right

399
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,220
one of the faces and this is actually
very one security minded person was as

400
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,080
you know

401
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,380
i'd understand the need to keep them the
price if you are

402
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,900
ability to for your weekly user
experience still have

403
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,390
i still need to mounting that user
experience i still want

404
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,900
so whatever mexican logic access the
data

405
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,970
or hear my intern once thought to the
data that i don't know if it perfectly

406
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,300
so we look at ballou we freed up

407
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,950
dustin the main thing

408
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,920
it right now

409
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,470
this are just so much that this pics
actually choice that this piece of

410
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,180
the deployment

411
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,770
nor the or the

412
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,740
population of

413
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,490
beware the devices known

414
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,840
discrete icons like brats libraries
everything within siskel

415
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,480
as you can see such a beatles shifting

416
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,540
you know some internal support for item
on the old buddies

417
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,500
such a shift in from the traditional
blackberry they can

418
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,270
of course the control

419
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,260
a lot more

420
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,550
to with things that

421
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,610
unique

422
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,300
more sophisticated

423
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,090
capabilities i can be and something to
that to be able to be successful

424
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,180
malevolent even that veto

425
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,050
because you probably you know that are
ready

426
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,520
so we have complexity we have all this
technologies

427
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,790
we have been needs

428
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,929
to be competitive

429
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,920
adopting this technology is because

430
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,600
but you have a ever was

431
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,560
i daresay

432
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,500
two weeks ago

433
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,260
and that was in in their australia last
week percent general conference

434
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,470
uh... man

435
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,770
they guy comes to me in australia and
new service sector the same thing that

436
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,320
another person completely unrelated

437
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,950
told me in our essays that

438
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,250
you know i have this path

439
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,480
and there

440
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,330
he's not a security guys is that
something that looks like it

441
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,090
i have this dilemma that i have some

442
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,510
also but isn't there

443
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,510
guys

444
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,150
ironic that you have a job

445
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,630
you've got to go now back into the
things that are moving so fast right now

446
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,110
uh... the uh...

447
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,580
died i can deploy a server you know that
from deployed applications and

448
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,140
everything but things are moving so fast
that they're actually falling behind

449
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,960
what do you recall man

450
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,250
well hat on the security guy

451
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,330
yeah i guess my jump is also in the
landing here but uh...

452
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,450
and they make me

453
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,580
you don't do that may be thinkin that
reduction this was our say

454
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,220
at the same thing

455
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,030
similar scenario it in australia

456
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,940
and it's true

457
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,210
things are actually moving so fast

458
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,170
that not only of course you know the
jobs and everything are game play is

459
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,430
that how do we actually mundane security

460
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,250
and how the woman thing that equilibrium
and how

461
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,220
loose to you know food credo

462
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,630
now if you go back to and use ok patch
management for him

463
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,040
ebb point devices bus management you
know has

464
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,070
for g_o_p_ writes them and you have
automatic push to patch is you know if

465
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,350
that happens effective for thanks

466
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,240
you you have

467
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,570
central management stations that i can
get acid repositories and everything

468
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:25,010
but for network infrastructure device is
not so much

469
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,659
now the industry is actually

470
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:30,999
trying to come up with ways somewhere
how we can actually do a lot of security

471
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,710
animation right now

472
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,300
and into the fact

473
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,460
that not only will tell me if a device
that same robert is running paul forty

474
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,789
done is one that will too

475
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,350
fifty planes

476
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,770
but if it's actually running the
configuration

477
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,809
and there's

478
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:51,080
for those of you that i returned from a
detroit from here with

479
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,210
with cisco here

480
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,700
omit any network infrastructure devices
you know they're they're more that one

481
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,470
just one way or one-click

482
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,570
people figured thinks i can't be a
lessor

483
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,680
pgp you're right beside the complexity
of their is is huge

484
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,080
that's the key to get on a show and is
actually something that is

485
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,370
we're taking baby steps

486
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,180
of course we brought him be a little
more i don't know

487
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,490
what i consider myself is that we we do
have some close solution somewhere we

488
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,710
we can assess

489
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,549
there

490
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:23,470
poster of the devices after a pipe bomb
to secure devices

491
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,290
we have some standards are actually
marching right now like ascap is one of

492
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,010
them was a buffet last week

493
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,419
was an idea

494
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,400
who was on proposals for new working
group second

495
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,580
of what we have some

496
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,170
you guys from my dirtier

497
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,310
batman

498
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,590
so things are actually voting but i
consider that we're pretty much about

499
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,940
here

500
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,470
we still in that

501
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,240
vernier thirty h

502
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,210
between the but you like to have a
pollution of security protocols or

503
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,120
election

504
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,700
the way that we can actually playing
some more

505
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,020
victory

506
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,440
i'll share some of these two things that
she would not cisco ios

507
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,799
may be relevant may not be relevant for
you but

508
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,000
things that i chaired

509
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,950
not only assist the weather everywhere

510
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,500
is that it

511
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,870
now trying to create ways that machines
and poker machines

512
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,610
until about the i can do assessments

513
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,470
but in order for me to do that

514
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,020
if i polish up by three that's a young

515
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,659
on the night was router that

516
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:24,200
and our search broader have to passed
nine hundred thousand devices

517
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,220
uh... elegant that your someone said
with right

518
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,490
now if i can make that

519
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,150
uh... by sri

520
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,279
machine-readable

521
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,820
and uh...

522
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,860
organization can actually take that up
by three and

523
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,550
sleigh says they want

524
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,420
it's you know hopefully attribute them
to be more efficient

525
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,390
now what we do it right now is that she
would polishing up my sleeves with

526
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,419
of all the permissions i'm not going to
the whole beetle

527
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:51,840
but he said

528
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,620
expand their language that you develop

529
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,580
or monthly but later

530
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,980
doing c_p_r_

531
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,080
is that way of production up by sweet

532
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,350
machine readable right now

533
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,390
why am i mentioned this

534
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,630
so that the reason that i mentioned this
is that a we actually have to pay

535
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,980
attention

536
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,920
not by suzanne x_ amount for lebanese
machine-readable

537
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,820
but what can actually we can automate
successful

538
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,190
and what can not we did not automate

539
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,150
that they've been willing to do some you
know more security risk and explain why

540
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,550
later

541
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,650
well before i do have course

542
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,510
of another video

543
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,290
at least a little

544
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,190
but it brings things into perspective
regarding the things that we sold last

545
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,190
year

546
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,510
so what is the lesson here

547
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,039
i guess that we can continue to watch
porn because the

548
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,210
let's look smaller than

549
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,789
and a

550
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:28,220
and then ecologically would match
exactly

551
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,169
looks cool

552
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,710
with a good sign

553
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,460
now actually thought about metrics
actual prosecuted metrics

554
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,510
some analysis uh...

555
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,679
i what i do

556
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,510
and of course you know people cannot you
sell your kid so yeah you have two

557
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,160
thousand

558
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,620
percent increase amal were for
unbelievably good beginning there was no

559
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,600
one believes in

560
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,559
putting identical twins percentage right

561
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,779
victim world here is actually that

562
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,330
it is increasing write something that

563
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,810
phase action here to my car because i
actually like

564
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,399
difference is that a lot

565
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,720
and i used a lot

566
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,540
well you know that risk is increasing

567
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,110
medellin creasing book

568
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,750
then

569
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,980
i will not call it

570
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,990
when the bad guys but

571
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,820
the guys that i chair finding these ma
where or that created at the where the

572
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,330
you know

573
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,500
finding the the

574
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,670
the issues

575
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,840
their first system right now

576
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,050
are very very very very successful right
now

577
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,260
we're going to all good

578
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,920
metrics in here since you don't use or
we without security report that they

579
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,700
want to make available

580
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,139
what i wanted to achieve

581
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:40,410
at share with you is something that

582
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,850
you'll prolly known you watch the news

583
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,230
so if you go back and look at occasions
over a list of the snapshots of

584
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,160
many places in the intent of course on

585
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,050
we saw that

586
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,470
the distribution

587
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,729
of contemplates and of course as a whole
bunch of obligations then you know

588
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:58,310
messages small

589
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,309
you know we have to accept the that

590
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:03,090
not that it interesting

591
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,620
don't we compare at the content types
and actual woman abilities

592
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,210
and if you see here of course

593
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,570
what is number one thing job

594
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,200
let them know that uh... figured out
what you know

595
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,910
what i'm going that these that

596
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,070
things are being repeated over and over
and over and over

597
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,640
even though we have new level of this
everyday in anything

598
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,860
not begin on the devil

599
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,360
cisco has its share

600
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,430
everybody has its share

601
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,630
attackers actually

602
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,310
yeah they're very clever as right now

603
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,770
there also using

604
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,080
you know old stuff

605
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,179
not line

606
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:40,640
little bit later

607
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,760
cool thing

608
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,630
that i brought into perspective actually
a friend of mine

609
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,039
at cisco vpn

610
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,550
share these with it

611
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,770
is getting so out of control and abandon
them

612
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,580
i don't want to on the pink and yellow
but these guys are controlled the people

613
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,960
are actually doing doing some

614
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,620
op nifty visually sections of now the
timeline of all that will that will be

615
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,230
some specific you know

616
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,460
uh... hyperion

617
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,310
and it's actually online this is just
uh... this patient i took today and i

618
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,130
just finish this lately

619
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,190
you can tell

620
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,010
and this is actually the link

621
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,950
and we have to get stuck to even keep up
with the open minds like that his

622
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,200
getting insane

623
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,870
but again

624
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,309
by this new attacks all attacks

625
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:25,450
of course they're actually both it

626
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,970
different motives

627
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,180
of course how many of you

628
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,860
red october

629
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,750
means that i

630
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,259
them so i'll be somebody what

631
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:38,200
somebody hasn't hurt

632
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,460
so red october was a large scale

633
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,590
seige aspin aj

634
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,830
campaign

635
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,790
for five years actually took place on

636
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,070
some researchers for first whiskeys

637
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,989
to talk to them

638
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:54,960
it three times

639
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,179
and some of it but uh... she's output
posted a blog posting you if you want in

640
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:00,480
no more about it

641
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,540
actually have ma were associated

642
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,340
in that something that

643
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,450
were

644
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,430
very similar to the

645
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,809
the behavior that we had and all who
wants lehman

646
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,060
all the other ones

647
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,640
that think that i want to it

648
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,789
all the time of course is actually
attributed to mission statement and also

649
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:21,880
the middle into politics right now

650
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,919
but it things that was

651
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,090
for example when i ran a bid to become

652
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,940
position

653
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,640
what action took place and

654
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,660
civil level is aware exploited

655
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,020
you see the door a lot of other believes
this happened for five years of course

656
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,370
you know he's

657
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,049
they're building and they're actually
the word

658
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:38,470
jane you pretty quickly but

659
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,870
whenever this all the way from

660
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,060
two thousand nine

661
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,340
that they are still so so slow

662
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,790
this eulogy

663
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,430
they are successful opening

664
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,760
the reason that i got involved in this
is because their claims

665
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,440
or their findings in the plane's rocky
findings

666
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,420
they said they

667
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,870
there's such a cisco

668
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,220
infrastructure devices that were
actually a fact

669
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,060
device

670
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,740
configurations refuse thoughtful so of
course you know

671
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,120
involvement

672
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,340
we thought that a

673
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,200
was because of a woman ability

674
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,860
and it wasn't

675
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,370
they gave me about six of them something

676
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,059
and trees on the dictionary attack

677
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:23,960
very simple from you know csco one two
three two let me know into anything else

678
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,160
but there still successful announced
that actually

679
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,649
if you look at this assessment

680
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:31,190
was like ninety percent for the week
passwords

681
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,960
again everybody knows this

682
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,850
as a whole bunch of the best of early
here

683
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,330
so you know that's actually the

684
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,590
the the sweet spot they will was tonight

685
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,200
for the clever api part about the issues

686
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,500
that there is becoming a mob more clever

687
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,750
before more

688
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,090
into the fact

689
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,070
that they are able to correlate

690
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,720
information from

691
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
all their findings

692
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,700
in other words

693
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,520
at about six of us something

694
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,720
their passports

695
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,000
i looked up only about thirty of them

696
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,610
there were really strong passwords

697
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,970
icon status

698
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,309
very long and everything

699
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:10,490
asset atonement out

700
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,520
collecting these

701
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,320
they were the tradition

702
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,570
and because of the level of a similar
things people storing passports in an

703
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,050
excel spreadsheet

704
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,940
people starring host names in excel
spreadsheets

705
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,440
karachi able to correlate the bella such
msn m_p_ passport for network

706
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,840
infrastructure devises a decade arrest
you gave him the whole thing you given

707
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,190
that

708
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,260
the passport

709
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,229
the horse named

710
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:34,420
bank address at the bohemian or

711
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,419
might as well just given on the books
too

712
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,230
that's the top of

713
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,759
complex and i will not settled but some
of you know

714
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,500
flapper more clever right now

715
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,730
they're being successful article index

716
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,690
remember that

717
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,940
with a great part

718
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,200
rented a whole bunch of

719
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,640
it's not service as well in this case

720
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,629
there's someone out

721
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:58,870
there such a people that

722
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,169
that still correct marks

723
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:04,150
they're actually rented them then
launching attacks

724
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,000
want to only the financial if that's
what i want to

725
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,989
do it give you just a mix employees
uh... operation

726
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,879
a bigger up abhi bail

727
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,069
uh... from prosodic correctly

728
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,509
was a huge dot

729
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:16,389
develops

730
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:21,079
or body metrics effects that we actually
have never seen before in the industry

731
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,939
and a we have seen a lot of

732
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:25,829
for timothy the those attacks before

733
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,189
when this case

734
00:34:27,189 --> 00:34:29,009
people either rent that

735
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:31,949
the combination of activism

736
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:36,959
the combination of actually being from
compromise large this interim providers

737
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:42,259
russian launch of activity in spanish
institutions on the still going on

738
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:45,459
some of the things that things are
actually still going on

739
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,529
now again this is a book about your
setbacks

740
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:53,490
at some points we actually saw about a
hundred beacuse of traffic or more

741
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,109
going to this

742
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:57,670
of course you know even if you are

743
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,049
management manipur

744
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,189
corporation information explosion

745
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:05,499
you you know how big it seems that still
make it work is gonna have a nice guy

746
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:06,809
leave a mark right

747
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:10,369
ability is that providers of course will
affect the by this because biggest

748
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:12,009
centralized probing

749
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,489
and then

750
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:15,010
in some cases been perfect

751
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,660
uh... the customers we're still working
on solutions

752
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,729
and everything else

753
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:20,979
it right now

754
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:22,099
uh... i just want to know

755
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,119
give you an example

756
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,690
things that are all school although you

757
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,619
probably thought the worst there

758
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,219
two years ago i've been told that it
would be more optimism only do emily c

759
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:33,559
here and everything else

760
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,639
sachi becoming a lot more prevalent

761
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,729
nowadays

762
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:40,369
and work level part about it

763
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:42,869
is that a of course you know there were

764
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:44,909
some machines that were rented

765
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:45,740
uh... man

766
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,249
that he would rent that would

767
00:35:47,249 --> 00:35:50,209
stolen credit card information

768
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:52,409
what can i do

769
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:54,599
to a bank or financial institution

770
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,459
to make sure that you don't report but
you're a precarious point

771
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:00,749
webhosting wright the eq system

772
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:03,009
so whatever you call

773
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:05,879
eight hundred number back and they're
prepared you cannot even

774
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,759
feeling that you're preggers pple

775
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:09,269
there were actually doing that too

776
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,409
is not what this is beyond

777
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:12,659
jazz at the loss

778
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:15,879
sasheba coming

779
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:18,519
very common though that you tried to
hide

780
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,799
or the types of attack

781
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,690
anyway still i think that it's actually

782
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,839
so we're seeing right now it's also the
organization of

783
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:29,799
a better way of what when i sing

784
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:30,440
techniques

785
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,639
for things like ideas like firewalls up
and i got to bypass

786
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,939
the n_a_s_ a fortson

787
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:38,899
on the topic of my on stuff

788
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:40,750
it does not see something that we saw it

789
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,559
big round

790
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,639
and last year

791
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,269
and not only that but

792
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,769
if you find immigration technique

793
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:49,109
you can be sucessful luncheon at that

794
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,069
such as something that i can also sell

795
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:53,929
not only a mile reconciled with the
consent of the technique

796
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:54,650
i get back in

797
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,349
right so you have a patent because of it

798
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,680
technology but he also happens for

799
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,009
methodologies

800
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:05,129
uh... some of the largest

801
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:07,740
at any rate in so blackouts

802
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,969
any good news

803
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:13,119
white-tailed a couple of product on

804
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,349
yeah you should go about this

805
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:16,769
but what a radio

806
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:21,069
i think it's going to tell

807
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:25,879
i guess spam went down last bassinger
against it dot counts for anything

808
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:30,449
the only thing is that criminal still
uses plan uh... they actually have

809
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,440
recipes are still pretty good points
back

810
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,109
even those pants socks

811
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:37,299
but it does pretty well whatever
actually they are successful and then

812
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:40,399
make a lot of money out of it

813
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:42,420
one thing that actually happened last
week

814
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,230
in a minute

815
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,079
cook

816
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,409
other people that are here from

817
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,619
it women is the chance

818
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:49,569
but a

819
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:54,569
uh... you know there's this is how
clever people who are going

820
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:57,179
defying reported one that will be

821
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,879
and it's not like we were looking at
oval definition to see if it on the

822
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:01,339
repercussions for it

823
00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:04,859
but now that i'm trying to automate the
subway series and everything

824
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,160
we fight here

825
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,909
let's say a compromise

826
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:11,139
don't start up again right now cisco dot
com

827
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:14,309
lets a compromise of vendors website the
word

828
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:18,230
i say that it will now believes affected
inversion one two three four five

829
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,170
but is not affected in the persian
origin

830
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,990
you know the the person that's a fact
that no changes or i do not think that

831
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,289
nobody pays attention to

832
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:28,909
stick a stretch

833
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:30,519
but in this case actually

834
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,709
that was

835
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,710
it and all this

836
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,580
and and bb

837
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,369
that awaits them

838
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:36,669
how many of you what you heard about
that

839
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:40,619
through much of a weakness

840
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,939
you know maybe activism and everything i

841
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:45,669
committee member of mostly because i
don't even know the details

842
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:49,499
with it

843
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:51,529
yeah we got bring it down but

844
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,269
but what are the repercussions sometimes
even for the security community for some

845
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:59,919
of these acts right

846
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:01,600
their supposing there another time

847
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,489
going to need to have a proposta

848
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:06,199
the post yesterday about it

849
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,599
so what i want to talk to a close is
that it

850
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,899
all these things are evolving

851
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:13,320
uh... wean we all

852
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,639
no that

853
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,550
it be

854
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,609
complexity

855
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:17,939
using policing

856
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,279
them sophistications of effects

857
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:22,899
actually increasing this evolution or

858
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:24,779
even the clever ways of

859
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,239
protecting against security

860
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,720
is also changing

861
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,239
but we want to avoid

862
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,329
were

863
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:36,689
five or ten years from now we have to go
back into evolution assistance critics

864
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:38,989
we actually really messed it up

865
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:40,529
let's go back in time

866
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:41,999
so in

867
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:44,809
how come we actually team

868
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,989
one other thing sees

869
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:48,400
better cooperation

870
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,279
them better coordination

871
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,439
rightness secured the communities

872
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:55,119
uh...

873
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,500
not only after the murders

874
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,739
but as a community as a whole

875
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:02,479
actually belong to an organization
polite gas is a non-profit organization

876
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,869
even juniper is there

877
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,389
which was indeed

878
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:10,329
delivers the agree difference of over

879
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:12,619
ibm oracle

880
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,849
muscle

881
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:19,509
ips several of the big vendor so that we
ought to share whenever there's a

882
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:23,279
nishu that affects that's a p_c_p_ or
killers

883
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:27,769
will have better ways of communicating
and you know hopefully too

884
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:29,269
to mitigate

885
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:31,549
whatever that they choose

886
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:35,199
i will set a board meeting during our
stay regarding

887
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,329
this organization

888
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:37,579
we're looking at

889
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:39,929
cv details please

890
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:41,160
non-profit also denote

891
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,339
putting beatles information

892
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:44,809
maintenance

893
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,219
uh... man

894
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:49,230
we're trying to break it was talking
about but at any rate

895
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,639
we're not going to the accuracy

896
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,899
levels it was freedom accurate

897
00:40:53,899 --> 00:40:55,400
and we said okay

898
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,050
the companies that are here that

899
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,779
that are in these people

900
00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:02,200
very much own about seventy five percent
of the cvs that works for you

901
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,729
disclosed last year

902
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:04,530
or russia death

903
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,799
last five years we will look at

904
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:12,909
how many times actually would really
done say that week

905
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:16,779
we full operating successfully

906
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:20,349
and you know with just thinking if you
have to have to think and that you don't

907
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:22,949
give your fingers that something is
wrong

908
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,959
so we have to increase

909
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:28,019
going out of the boxes again unless you
know i yeah she mentioned that it

910
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,359
doesn't matter if you

911
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,229
deployed triple-a

912
00:41:31,229 --> 00:41:34,480
you deploy pianists and fire was still
getting attacked again

913
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,169
you know wish my son

914
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:41,339
what the state of the the network and
sick insecurities

915
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,549
prosecuting priests their ways people
operate this it's going to do it

916
00:41:45,549 --> 00:41:47,329
what i wanted to go

917
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:51,129
scan or poor because it's supposed to be
put in place but i want to ask you guys

918
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:54,079
what else can we do as a community

919
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,609
to increase

920
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:59,609
not only proliferation breakthroughs a
secured the poster of anything

921
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:06,609
what else do you see what it's like a
couple mine for some of you right now

922
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:15,729
a nose job security but you have to be
something

923
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:21,140
actually so that that

924
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,209
the commonwealth dumb crucified people
don't find that liberalism a secular

925
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,519
absolutely true

926
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,740
the first step is

927
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,109
pay attention to the friggin

928
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:32,989
people that are trying to hook

929
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:35,659
report that you are not sell them on
that would be

930
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,629
okay in bed

931
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:38,989
on the ground

932
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:39,999
community

933
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,269
and actually you know uh... uh... this
given credit right so but i'm going to

934
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,219
the financial rewards and everything
because this

935
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:47,529
topic for

936
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:49,889
nobody here

937
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:53,449
that's actually absolutely true

938
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:57,159
one thing that he's very

939
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,009
one of the reasons properly that

940
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,449
roxie seeing a lot ending district not
only a cesspool

941
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:05,859
we're seeing a lot we have reports that
she would get

942
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:10,919
emails everyday on security issues uh...

943
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:12,159
when the leases

944
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,899
freedom from we actually is so long that
we ought to dedicate a person just to

945
00:43:15,899 --> 00:43:20,379
read emails week would not be too

946
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:22,930
just so nearly you can get all the
reports and

947
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,310
we cover all the

948
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,409
twelve hundred

949
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,539
diplomatic number of my behind with

950
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,609
you know it

951
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:35,499
hundreds of product so we actually have
a cisco we get all this

952
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:38,910
we've got a lot of researchers and of
course the communion persons it would be

953
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,469
an we work with them and ask him

954
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:43,879
i can tell you that the research
communities

955
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:47,169
pretty awesome especially when it comes
to the network devices

956
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:52,099
they've probably yet we still need to
know where to go over things

957
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:55,369
but what we're seeing right now is that
a bicycle our researchers still come in

958
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:57,929
in but a lot of brokers as well

959
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:01,999
and then i ask you know why do we get
these brokers is because well sometimes

960
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:06,879
they were not asa cesspool whenever we
send the reports to you

961
00:44:06,879 --> 00:44:09,779
you know we give it to brokers and if
they ask me what you want to use it or

962
00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:10,699
want to

963
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:12,900
lurking and that we're getting a lot of
archie

964
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,579
reports from brokers

965
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:17,739
dynamic why is this happening that we

966
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:21,199
assay industry as a whole we are not
being that consistent

967
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:23,909
that such a very very very good

968
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:30,059
observation what else

969
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:31,649
don't get over two percent of

970
00:44:31,649 --> 00:44:38,649
helena bonham

971
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,359
so that that's actually one thing that
it

972
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:00,249
matter one of the hundred

973
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:04,019
uh... i don't need even records mindful
of that you know that the model

974
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:06,909
people are actually trying to develop
the skills

975
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:09,439
security development life cycle

976
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:11,839
and that investing a lot of money into
it

977
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,189
and uh... it's it's just because of that
right

978
00:45:17,189 --> 00:45:18,479
i guess i talked

979
00:45:18,479 --> 00:45:20,419
what it today

980
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:21,969
they've got

981
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,839
two weeks in their sons on the seventeen
months by talking

982
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:28,949
but i really appreciate your time today
before you start you what's useful

983
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:30,289
undetected for having me
