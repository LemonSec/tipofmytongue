1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:06,690
up on my contact information interesting
and one you try some other

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,219
out me talking about Berkeley

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:14,059
former with today reflected in

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,400
mean I am at dad

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,960
question like in

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,410
and then get it

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:31,050
and then all interrupt me

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,040
I know you guys are gonna probably
affect though you're probably gonna

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,370
forget the question if we wait the end
you have you know

10
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,000
something interesting your on

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,610
so me

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,789
powerful

13
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:56,309
I did not using their resources on my
own research

14
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,570
nothing work of fun in

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,180
om previously done work maybe i'd

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,400
the work our mouth

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,549
did for the Air Force web happen

18
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,100
or Minister down in no develop use cases

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,200
wat so that we can see

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,820
proved on the product I'll to work for
the

21
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,280
you Charlotte

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,400
for about six months finding Lee

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,470
having like on and I've also done

24
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,510
previously done years consulting with on

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,000
understand security get ideas for how
they can

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,100
mitigate Charlotte

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:53,100
information interest die

28
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,120
yes and

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,360
like first-person shooters

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,840
see like travelling com

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,860
Carolina on Twitter us

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,000
like here but air

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,510
so it's good for about me and talk about
the you actually came here for

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,890
art so what I want to talk about is

35
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,340
you know how to download and get burp
set up

36
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,230
things other art

37
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,020
I'll sees hockey proxy emerging works
can give a little bit

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,110
on and then I'm gonna go through
intercepting

39
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,600
explain comp about for works talk about
how it wat

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,340
things history what you're doing through
you can go back

41
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,510
which later maybe you know stop in

42
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,709
you know ok something that final
interesting

43
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,570
on and then also touch on fire I
personally know

44
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,680
fine very I liked things happen

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,880
I think nap laughton

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,900
have the idea for whatever

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,260
so

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,100
there's the repeater you

49
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,350
reply back there's the intruder

50
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,870
which doesn't else has a decoder

51
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,980
error which allowed see if they're
changed

52
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,019
as well as a quick and dirty let's take
this

53
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,880
ask hex unique

54
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,660
around exactly what the app is actually
doing

55
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,819
on and ongoing to you

56
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,470
all the talk in the demo about how have
a network layout

57
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,600
networks an

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,960
my network and I'm going to give neck so

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,650
basically Albert works view that don't
now

60
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,340
or understand the basic corporate proxy
on

61
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,819
basically without a proxy Street with
the proxy

62
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:10,380
amber you basically are redirecting your
stuff tuber

63
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,020
it stopped it allows you to modify the
packet replay it

64
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,200
to the Internet and you are and the fun
things

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,060
you wouldn't be able you on necessarily
with just you know modifying

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,330
code route so

67
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,520
ready amor on number comet sportswear
dotnet

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,630
on so mindful that on

69
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,870
the current version they're on is 1.50 5
just

70
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,320
now released after on during nature

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,630
on the they were free and pro version
the pro version has additional features

72
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,099
here I have ability to like say

73
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:56,140
and restore your session so you go back

74
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,039
go back and I think the that it also has

75
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,160
doesn't rival you when you're

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,110
doing sequencers so

77
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,099
you know basically you know the trying
to build model but also give away for

78
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:12,479
free

79
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,979
on really when does get Java

80
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,800
you run for jar file

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,370
install the the fall Jerry

82
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,590
works fine and then Mac

83
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,120
for dollar running so

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,760
getting everything ready for for proxy

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,430
on you want to use party proxy dork

86
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,120
on you basically go to toolbars

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,350
and and you'll have this

88
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,050
a nice little menu here where you can
switch from

89
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,280
just not having a proxy to actually
having a proxy me

90
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,280
per on this helps a lot when you're
actually but then you wanna

91
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,550
yes which tuber havel

92
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,300
the Ajax switchback and you have to go
through all

93
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,800
option setting up SOCKS proxy

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,980
on

95
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,639
okay so once you have proxy

96
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,760
on and setup an actual

97
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,630
proxy with that on you want to go into
bur so basically

98
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,020
you go to proxy an option and the
default

99
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,280
I prefer not to use that because I might
be running

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,650
wanna use 100 not gonna

101
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,530
by know what happened and up with that
and

102
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,050
you can basically have everything going
through

103
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,330
proxy so

104
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,650
here's why intercept looks like army
first

105
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,320
tell Firefox go through

106
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,440
for it's gonna look like this now whole
winter have yet

107
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,710
and on the air gonna be on

108
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,180
on another thing to keep in mind is not
getting

109
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,180
others in a lurch to over on the right
hand side information about what

110
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,270
going on if you're doing something wrong

111
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,880
try and help you on

112
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,990
so as you're browsing the Internet or
the

113
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,259
the web app on you're gonna start
getting things

114
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,270
history so I here com I was

115
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,460
you know rousing minor or axe on

116
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,830
you know and I was theology query stuff
going on

117
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,990
the you know I was going to you yet been

118
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,330
make I pro which is

119
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,560
and then I can click on each one the
what's going on

120
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,000
on and then I have different talk about
minute

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,080
on as well as I can right click and I
consenting

122
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,290
to the intruder repeater sequencer

123
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,800
or compare and then manipulate them
there

124
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,410
and then replace them

125
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,160
on there's also another thing that's
called the target

126
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,350
and it builds more flight has here are
key

127
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,830
I love the different sites been going to
you

128
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,380
so for example I went to you play here
on

129
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,199
Google and their break follows out you
can see what's going on

130
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,759
on here had on different your pages

131
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,020
and then folders based on with so it's

132
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,190
rebel the JavaScript yeah I'd been has

133
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,550
itself broken out there and so you know
it works really well for C

134
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,600
you know that aspect where history wall

135
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,510
yes before

136
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,510
sure thing

137
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,290
but

138
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,920
with that said I i to get another
account hack

139
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,360
the other day I don't know now

140
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,600
well

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,760
then right really on

142
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,340
so fighter on as you can see it has a
lot of redneck

143
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,860
that you can you words like directed

144
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,810
which direction wanna go on one thing I
recommend

145
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,440
doing if your gonna go spire is make
sure the

146
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,100
walkout so I've had problems rather than

147
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,630
and I'll be running through Mike

148
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,630
because it basically goes through the
very first for the paid

149
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,000
you know fueling and then log out and
then that

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm happen think work you can use some
other redneck tenors

151
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,940
say don't have to log out just over the
app

152
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,250
rarely so

153
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,670
these right click this is the BER

154
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,800
appear on and member I have the
drop-down

155
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,160
says right click century Peter so you're
gonna get

156
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,320
on basically this this can screen

157
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,170
on has two-step two areas so it's got
the wrong

158
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,680
grammer's headers heck which is Sen

159
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,720
and then it also has the response which
is what's coming back

160
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,170
so you can actually build the response
build the

161
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,310
on request it go

162
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,820
and then you'll get the responses back
you can play around and see

163
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,290
with the raw you know headers hex what
what you get back

164
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,320
going on you don't have to you know go
back

165
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,720
history and so

166
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,470
on I work done here basically broken now

167
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,600
on the different tad we can talk about
you

168
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,440
on so one other things and also is a lil
bit late in the demo

169
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,640
are was I parameters so that I can see

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,120
all the different things get request was
actually have a look at the raw

171
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,440
train figure out was gonna

172
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,600
so what I thought was when I clicked

173
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,690
a different wing om for the different
folders on my network access storage

174
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,230
unit for this particular app

175
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,680
om that it was sending a GET request for

176
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,520
the actual location so what I did

177
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,850
was I was like well if I have public
folder

178
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,120
can I change that to another

179
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,140
that maybe I really never should be bien

180
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,360
so as you can see here change lot go

181
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,420
and then I was able to you get a
rendering on the response now we've got

182
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,710
that have public folder we get the home

183
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,520
been really never on

184
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,460
network bird on

185
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,480
can also look at raw on fears

186
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,350
things that you're missing render this
is actually rock text

187
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,510
back you also have headers

188
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,270
market no on

189
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,970
and here for the you'd

190
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,490
tamper data on I

191
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,520
personally prefer or because it a lot
better job doing

192
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,850
I haven't really gotten working very
well

193
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,920
with a nine incher with of

194
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,920
so on that the real big selling point
for you can do a lot of posts on this is

195
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,200
hex

196
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,540
here actually find out with the
characters are

197
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,220
Armani underwrite now which

198
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,740
and other really nice job you know
rising for you

199
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,420
stepped away

200
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,980
and there's a more

201
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,980
under are

202
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,450
I so this is Burke intruder

203
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,040
on the cool thing that you can do with
this is actually

204
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,080
force on and so

205
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,890
it has a section you know basically

206
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:27,180
hacks where you send it the request then
it parses out the different variables

207
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,970
and you can pick an attack

208
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,210
on you need to do on the site

209
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,750
so for this example on we have a fighter
so we'd only wanna do you want variable

210
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,060
and then what you would do you put a
word list to it

211
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,140
and go and the free version got a
problem super and then it'll go through

212
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,430
your word list

213
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,560
and try each one the giving you the
request number

214
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,740
what was actually doing status they came
back with

215
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,560
and had in years in as well

216
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,140
the laying and any kind I'm or

217
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,430
what exactly gonna so in this example
here II

218
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,720
created just simple PHP

219
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,170
file and basically had it as password
one

220
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,650
so I ran it through here and as you can
see most the links are

221
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,090
360 360 sixty but

222
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,520
on half one like different some I'm
getting two hundred

223
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,360
on all so I'm not getting for 4403

224
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,390
you know it the the web a say

225
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,660
basically actually giving me proper
response

226
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,050
you couldn't get in but for this one it
gave a different

227
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:47,050
respond different side that one

228
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,560
so here's the decoder on just briefly it
has

229
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,850
different boxes here and as your
building

230
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,260
thing doing different

231
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,490
difference that you know code in

232
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,640
packet on it'll build new

233
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,830
you want to go so you can put in

234
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,080
example and then for this one I did

235
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,670
you know just deco

236
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,890
hex and so yeah and then basically I

237
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,390
you know would have other ones that work
on them

238
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,830
the compare is basically taking
different things

239
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:35,130
and then seen if there's a different
length or if there's any differences in

240
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,240
this is helpful for when you're actually
clicking on links

241
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,270
and wanna go back hands the

242
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,390
okay was say changed as I was going
through

243
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,010
maybe there is something different I
didn't pick up on

244
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,370
you know you know

245
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,230
on the other thing to do is they have an
extender which is

246
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,450
you API you can get and basically you
can write your own

247
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,460
home for per week though it

248
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,180
trying yet all like library

249
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,230
different that would were

250
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,970
you can do things

251
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,710
things that'll

252
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,460
a really long

253
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,750
arm miners yes

254
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:37,750
I'll up

255
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,520
well

256
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,280
okay

257
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,370
yeah I knew I'd seen doesn't have pearls
okay

258
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,330
I thought I might be wrong but thank you
for the country's

259
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,340
arts much time

260
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,740
art so

261
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,350
this is what I've had on my network got
in college and

262
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,800
we're just one to our

263
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,040
act boxing chief dollars

264
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,080
purchased in 2000 ours

265
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,990
I panel layout of an hour

266
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,270
that I had at the time doing so you've
got

267
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,410
year Rd your the router got a media
server laptop

268
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,530
all on what I did for

269
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:47,530
ideas is basically I here now

270
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,060
on so basically what I have I have a a
script that Ron

271
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,220
and i'd runs every three

272
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,430
an hour were different ports and

273
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,880
anything has seen basically like

274
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,260
laptop

275
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,380
again email with what or through mac
Address whopping

276
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,700
running and so I had this running and I
know

277
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,380
had you or I'm

278
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,220
check out so I'm

279
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,110
so

280
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,520
I I started looking around sports and I
noticed that

281
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,060
the CE for this net has

282
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,660
abilities on however they don't

283
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,220
really X Wayne here actually going on

284
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,420
so I was like on

285
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:54,420
with that 0

286
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,509
okay

287
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:03,210
well I mean like there's no or something
like that

288
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,679
anyway

289
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,259
so out I got excited your story poking
but then I realized that somebody at RT

290
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,450
kinda you know figure

291
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,049
so what civil disclaimer I did not find
this phone

292
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:19,100
ileana 16 I expanded on

293
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,220
from the directory to reversal exploit
should be able to you

294
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,489
make a bash backdoor on using CDI

295
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:30,879
on I was also able to get a reverse
shell

296
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,570
and then I was also able to install from
box week

297
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,679
be able taken over and papers on

298
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,190
so Wed Peter

299
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,070
like I said I modified the

300
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,720
public folder shoes flashed like getting

301
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,139
the the route and

302
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:00,600
II wind and

303
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,139
uploaded a a

304
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:08,749
hash file the public and

305
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,200
basically I'm on

306
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,200
so here is the content the first version

307
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,200
holiday though

308
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,749
you know it's basically just in

309
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:31,029
last SH content intact make echo

310
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,690
the box on an ad

311
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,480
skating for 20 percent for you know

312
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,570
that and then once I got that out there
they will you

313
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,649
LS I thought that I was running

314
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,889
route which is bad on and

315
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:55,659
I can pretty much run any from that
script

316
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:59,759
because they were sitting in on

317
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,210
I'm updated it a little bit I got them
from were alone

318
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,690
unity on so we did air checking

319
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,590
when you run and you can access your
checking and we also

320
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,849
modified the querystring actually thing

321
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:20,629
I was get something

322
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:25,989
so all better I would bring get so

323
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:29,299
getting an actual shell because thats

324
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:32,700
not really a shell it is persistent but
doesn't do everything

325
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,799
on you know I really wanted neck

326
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,879
you know having trouble getting on their

327
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:42,539
because there's only like 3 mags and I'm
writing

328
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,489
think run anything

329
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:49,489
had to go in you whether faith we

330
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:56,299
file and breakdown so what we did was we
went and got net kak we broke it

331
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:59,509
open on and then got the arm burden

332
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:02,710
and upload and then we ran on

333
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,429
the netcat from the back door that I had
on their

334
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:10,399
on connected and were able to get

335
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:14,460
shell but it wasn't ace really install

336
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,869
so then we start looking around

337
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:22,059
changed at the the

338
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:25,639
trying to get telnet working on

339
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:28,960
we got rid of the the awe for Tom

340
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,739
and restart the server but the problem
with that was

341
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:36,759
week for some reason

342
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:40,539
we just you know would put in the
password

343
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:43,690
so then we appended 444

344
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,070
6 and restart and hold it

345
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,259
you use tender to and then

346
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:54,440
bash and attack L which allowed us to
log n

347
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,629
to tell without after so

348
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,720
I'm gonna go show what got actually
running

349
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:08,720
backdoor

350
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:17,009
here

351
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:25,490
ok

352
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:44,300
here

353
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:00,970
year

354
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,770
area so I was like ensure the neck at
session worried

355
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,970
Sep this is like all shell now

356
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:58,970
ru

357
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,840
see armed place

358
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:24,800
user system

359
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:38,440
that yeah yes though

360
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,710
pretty much

361
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,070
now and knock Mackin ping other things
an hour

362
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,980
i like it potentially get and Aaron

363
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,430
another so

364
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:59,070
and what's crazy about this is I was
like surely nobody

365
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,410
II

366
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,249
showed

367
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,100
that I mean

368
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,519
not not that one there that one internal

369
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,799
work

370
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,389
same so

371
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,710
potentially Aki getting get all their

372
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:30,600
I

373
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,609
yet but yah so I mean

374
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:38,259
it is slightly /url probably more

375
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:43,119
arm one other things that I did think
about doing the device

376
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:50,119
as a like dying service

377
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:06,490
so yeah has a dying

378
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,700
where you can

379
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:16,700
where you can actually but

380
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,940
on you can that this to enable

381
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,299
and lech pickin so

382
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:31,230
one thing thing doing they're dying
unisys gonna have sir

383
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:37,510
urals search for their people's

384
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,789
sitting out there service and board

385
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,870
searched which was just dem

386
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:50,309
wide syntax and

387
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,399
I mean there's there's I i did. surgeon
you

388
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,299
out there but

389
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:03,610
that come out with it II actually had
some action points

390
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,260
first thing shelf from when I present
this after

391
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,389
on on so this list has gotten a lot
shorter so

392
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:14,510
wanting them wanna do may be at
individuals

393
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:19,500
back more helpful type

394
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,470
an author

395
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,610
obfuscation logs logging

396
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:32,830
obviously shell you get it hours

397
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,710
but maybe I keep it does

398
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,200
we were playing around with it you
system

399
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,990
logging but will me

400
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,549
in the traditional thanks but it does
have

401
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:53,840
certain things like the web server will
log your IP address

402
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,909
so once you hit the person

403
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:00,590
site your blog you have to go in your

404
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:07,590
doing yeah

405
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:16,159
I can actually your

406
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:24,620
board

407
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,679
I don't really now Debian

408
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,470
yet

409
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,730
I mean so the

410
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,059
version i'd did talk

411
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:47,059
guys one year

412
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,430
and

413
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:53,110
they were saying lotta time in

414
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,030
for the things their like I said

415
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,800
I only had like remake stop leftovers
their

416
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,090
trying so

417
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,890
I mean but neck works

418
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:15,370
and which it worked for us to get to the
point where we need

419
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,310
but I mean there's there's all kinds
regulars

420
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:26,310
up /url right here

421
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,060
yet I didn't think about that because I
was like like

422
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,270
all expressed

423
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,610
deal where exact yet

424
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:44,160
I mean and media wide

425
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,430
get everything on

426
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,440
yeah I'd i'mi am like wanna grab another

427
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:01,440
II got newer one but I haven't thing

428
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,560
more breaking more

429
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,140
I'll you know later going happen Apple

430
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,320
working really the only way

431
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,270
sir so with that crap

432
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,730
yep yeah I'd

433
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:29,520
that yet

434
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,800
they do have an update for this i'd back

435
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,620
so perfectly honest I was actually
hoping

436
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,020
would been cloth

437
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,680
one then I realized in wrong one

438
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,350
so I need to go back and actually buy
this version

439
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:57,590
the when I updated totally but I'd

440
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,090
this research not be back

441
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:08,090
it they're not many when I search last
time people prying

442
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:16,790
want a ride yeah

443
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:34,430
are I have not by basically like

444
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:41,430
would-be this

445
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,530
right yet that would actually thing I i
did. take it apart

446
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,700
over there falling apart how aka I don't
know where this period

447
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,520
obviously traveling differently but on

448
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,640
yeah I did take it apart employed in my
desktop

449
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,400
and actually I'll it looks like they've
actually gotta

450
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,020
p flash life on their separate from the
hard drive and I

451
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,780
haven't quite figured out there with
that

452
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:21,780
I think area yet

453
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:31,349
yeah

454
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:31,769

493
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:31,430
you can get creative there are several

494
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,640
up you know they've got

495
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,789
think through back there

496
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:44,829
another one

497
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:49,009
i'd

498
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:55,130
up ornette have anything

499
00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:02,130
recommendations for them

500
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,210
i'm glad you mentioned II meant to cover
that

501
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:36,380
on tho just for the recording people
back

502
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,910
recommending and

503
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:46,910
you think rocket you burp seeking with
yet

504
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:52,750
right you can you can basically
basically way

505
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,040
recommending your map so

506
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,630
for can also do other well not just

507
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,200
browsers like that and then

508
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,550
which you can do learn you can modified

509
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,550
replay pack understand exactly what

510
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:16,200
yes doing modify variance for

511
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,770
the actual app that way back

512
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:23,190
on one thing I'll

513
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:27,680
with addition to you where

514
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,500
talk about for you

515
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,590
brute forcing so

516
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,600
one other use case for the intruder

517
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,450
is to take write checks put that
analysts Word file

518
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,930
and or readers righted the actual
application

519
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,050
om and then send that

520
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,880
you the actual you're tryin against you

521
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,500
and the wake on you know same way that

522
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,300
think with them injection

523
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,080
word and see which ones come back
actually

524
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,190
doing wine you can throw

525
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,300
you time in there and see which one work

526
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,790
and even if you don't get for success

527
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,160
you could the okay this one had

528
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,250
