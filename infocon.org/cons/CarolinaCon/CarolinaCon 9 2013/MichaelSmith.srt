1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,199
you're brave brave souls

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,819
getting up this early after the party
every night that's where appreciate good

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:10,929
y'all here so ways Michael snapper
doctor bear second were probably present

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:11,590
in the room

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,150
architecture design the proposed
architecture for shipping threat

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,180
landscape or subtitled

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,250
doctor strangelove capacity I would stop
worrying and

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,250
you know so I okay with you so

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,210
how many have you are actually doing
BYOD in your organization one

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,600
couple how many of the father just

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,890
terrified right yeah

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,450
more MORE there and good reason good
think I can understand

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,680
well what we say about his doc my
favorite pictures over

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,420
John fire pretty much me and contesting
you know just

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,660
running around on fire so I was like a
threat

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,820
security consultant for it. plus to your
better in the IAPs reaction out about 11

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,710
so need to update this doctoral
candidate at

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,600
Capitol college in Information Assurance
working on security intelligence

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,580
analytics

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,810
my with up certifications

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,180
nothing special where I'm mostly focus
on security assessments on the way the

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,820
other crap Meerman like

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,140
and that you can follow me on Twitter at
doctor bear sec

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,420
my name's you know Kansas there to talk
about

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,570
just briefly well as BYOD most you know
so I'm not gonna

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,659
focus on that very long i wanna talk
about BYOD how it relates to what I call

27
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,630
ship

28
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,670
mature me from there the concert that
ones record so

29
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,320
no worries there what beware the way I
think it's here to stay

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,950
benefits and challenges us and then
we're going to look at some people

31
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,060
implementation examples kinda been
general architecture

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,220
how it's done today and look at the rule
architecture design

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,729
resigned hybrid design those principal I

34
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,549
we talk about minimal trust security and
the Middle trust logical security layers

35
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:02,909
that are built into the design

36
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,430
and a reason improvement future work and

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,890
any questions that we might so beware
the we all know is bring your own device

38
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,760
accuser on devices

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,940
a growing trend for the purposes of this
talk we're not just talking about cell

40
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,720
phones for BYOD we're talking about

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,530
laptops insult any kind a consumer
device that might

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,410
your users might wanna bring to their
network will be a mac book whether it be

43
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:26,720
there

44
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,150
HP laptop Chromebook their smartphone
what who did

45
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,620
so for shit 3

46
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,959
shifting well said that three times fast
shipping

47
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,250
threat landscape so 30 much chance

48
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,220
threat got alright the STL in the FPL
this morning yet very shouldn't have

49
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,690
said that many words this early morning

50
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,500
it's a matter of when by that what I
mean is it's a matter of when you will

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,260
be hacked

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,620
a one-year think that their network is
completely have proof good there's no

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,780
wires in the room here

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,650
which thankfully hackers when the CIO's
buried under acid just pray

55
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,120
attack prepare the matter of when at
some point you're gonna be bridge

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,040
it's just gonna happen how bad it
happens how much damage is done

57
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,980
that's what we're looking to control mid
so

58
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,099
most hacks most most people are bridging
network yeah we have happened this year

59
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,220
we have the appt

60
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,930
nation-states coming after us mean
people doing it

61
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,470
are primer its mom who runs most

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,799
who want the IT security threats
nowadays well %uh

63
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,680
stuff the malware it's all done by the
Russian mob main part other

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,209
criminal groups out there their goal
their business is dade

65
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,519
that they won again and they want to
steal social security numbers they want

66
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,180
to steal

67
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,690
the credit card numbers data birth the
PI

68
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,280
information going then go sell i've seen
ads out there in the

69
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,580
darkened region the internet by a five
thousand dollar credit limit

70
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,920
credit card number for 300-400 box a

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,189
black market sales people are buying
make my money

72
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,269
because business is good we all know
trying to catch all the people was not

73
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:10,980
super easy

74
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,480
what time the way people get caught
these attacks what we've got to keep the

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,890
mouse

76
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,799
so you know people that showed up the
people there good about

77
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,949
they were pretty good success rate about
not getting caught doing

78
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:25,040
this is a good plus add in the fact
people or

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
overseas jurisdictions and run the ball
back crap it's really

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,479
makes a lot more difficult so as we all
know in this room

81
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,759
weakest link is people right

82
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,259
I'm going after you I can either try to
you know your brand new patch

83
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,889
built up for american tried by you owed
a second step

84
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,389
or just go to that guy sitting at the
front desk that might like the click

85
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,590
being sent him an email in a given to a
system that way

86
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,580
so most about the Duke and testing this
is one of our favorite target is going

87
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,419
after people

88
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,789
sold fishing BYOD is the probable future

89
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:04,970
and the reason I feel this way is we're
seeing a shift for a number of reasons

90
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,400
when the main reasons is as younger kids
are coming up in the group they're used

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,020
to

92
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,030
basically customizable life you know

93
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,870
customizable very specific they want to
use their own stock

94
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,910
and are looking for companies that let
them do that so where you'll see a lot

95
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,770
of companies like for this other Mousasi
I OCSO CEO's

96
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,850
is will start killing BYOD policy simply
to be able to attract

97
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,509
best up so the first rule of Fight Club
is

98
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,340
not talk and I had the wrong slide I'm
sorry

99
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,240
are so the first rule about shipping
threat landscape I said it right that

100
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,300
time

101
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,850
assume you will be breached anyone guess
for the second role shipping threat

102
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,490
landscape is

103
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,160
assume you will be reached

104
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,440
third world knowledge is power I'm very
big advocate

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,530
if you can tell by my district are my
doc my dissertation is on

106
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,050
security analytics intelligence up
knowing as much about your network is

107
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,120
possible

108
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,520
not only about sure internal network
have as much information there but know

109
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,080
about what's going on the outside

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,710
if you're not questioning yourself all
the time gathering information you

111
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,289
wouldn't

112
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,360
test working out there working on
Twitter looking on

113
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,259
the Internet finding out what anyone
with public internet access can find out

114
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,419
about you

115
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,520
to me you're doing yourself a disservice
so you're doing it wrong

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,889
we've seen phrase but you're doing
yourself a disservice so you should

117
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:27,669
bring in

118
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,889
I consider doing on a regular basis just
to find out what

119
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,539
people might be warned about fourth
World protection is important as

120
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:35,770
prevention

121
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,729
all night she been on preventing
preventing preventing

122
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,280
all about get my wallop prevent them
from coming and well

123
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,600
as we've talked about people being the
weakest link and the types of attacks

124
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,650
they're out there now

125
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,560
we talk about shifting threat landscape
i'm talking about. attacks like

126
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,300
client-side attacks social engineering
now where

127
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,120
web attacks not not the old school
traditional

128
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,289
find the server finding that MS 08 a 67

129
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,630
reach you in there but let's be honest
most the bus with anyone with

130
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,090
my comp security those holes are not
their

131
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,039
your patching you're blocking people
arts stupid anymore in security they

132
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,690
understand where they're at so

133
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,949
instead a stepping up with well most
people

134
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,199
most people or not the arm

135
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,630
as you're stepping up their are stepping
up into going for her were highly

136
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,090
sophisticated highly technical

137
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,750
going the opposite way were away almost
a doping test

138
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,789
we're wasting we are to me pics because
we want to make it simple

139
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,069
herself my guess expend the effort hours
and hours looking for a zero-day

140
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,289
I gotta go attack the guy at the the guy
account

141
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:45,190
playing solitaire and looking at your
Facebook all day long

142
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,669
go after him cuz it is on my success
rate going to be a lot higher

143
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,800
so by detection is as important as
prevention our goal

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,099
is to if we assume we're going to be
breached

145
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,910
our goal is to detect that bridge as
soon as possible

146
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,470
that will help women are with roll never
trust the gooey center

147
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,770
we could have the biggest brightest wall
out there you have it

148
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,840
top firewall people in the world we
build best

149
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,780
the best up there we have ideas we have
everything laid on top there some way to

150
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,389
the back door open

151
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,770
you're going to be bridged either way so
never trust the gooey center in those

152
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,509
are you familiar with your trust no

153
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,860
back that

154
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,470
in the sixth rule always be reassessing
always be

155
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,490
improving never rest on your laurels you

156
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,479
as security people always maybe other
wooden for the newest technologies

157
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,479
be testing your network if you have
something in place that looks like it

158
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,260
works but there might be some things

159
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,519
out there that can improve your security
look at

160
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,760
would bring in and do a demo to a lab
not sink thrown in production tomorrow

161
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,680
because that

162
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,670
always a recipe for disaster but
definitely tested out and pick work

163
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,010
and always be improving your network

164
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,330
Arts on the benefits and challenges we
have about BYOD

165
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,860
challenges loss of control this is what
scares the hell most

166
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,160
been on the system network admin side we
don't like the fact we're losing control

167
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,230
based on the way the

168
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,140
we don't have full control and so
because it that

169
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,810
because you know we always feel that we
know more than user

170
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,950
then and from mister but

171
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,140
we always had that feeling that were no
more than usual we can protect them from

172
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,230
themselves

173
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,589
we want to have that control well beware
the comes in the place

174
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:30,880
we wish that control worried about an
hour's

175
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,000
people out there people out there now
where

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,240
surfing the internet on their own
computers searching porn

177
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
torrent wherever finding nice little
files

178
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,459
the execution

179
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,110
system bringing a Trojan mine

180
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,459
I data loss exposure this is a big this
is a big one for most

181
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,709
this is obviously the biggest usually
the biggest fear that

182
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,970
here for most especially you up people
if that

183
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,350
worry about losing data that worry about
exposing

184
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,360
privileged information arm your

185
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,310
to some attacker or yo their end up on
the news the way

186
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,350
groups like Sony HP Gary Microsoft

187
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,589
Apple do I need to go on no I don't we
all know what I'm talking about

188
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:21,310
and then hidden costs thing would be
where these

189
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,540
times it does sound like it will be a
saber because you're not making this

190
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,870
capital

191
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,500
expenditures what the problem is you
don't properly planet

192
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,850
there are hidden costs me night think
about your first doing the

193
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,950
cost-benefit analysis BYOD so

194
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,610
those hidden costs are also appear
people we have to make sure we're

195
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,529
playing out BYOD

196
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,709
strategy that you take cost

197
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,970
that might mean if you're covering data
present you're going to subsidize people

198
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,620
for data

199
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,610
what the cost there what would be the
cost bring some your equipment up

200
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,660
are you going to need to do new training
are you going to need to do

201
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,730
new new equipment and most well

202
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,260
by what are those costs going to be so
those cost

203
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,510
were some the benefits what we talked
about attracting top how

204
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,230
arm you talk about rap count we're
talking about the young guys

205
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,000
when y'all water companies are sure to
go to be where the because

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,390
that is what those people and fear is

207
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,589
they don't do this their competitors

208
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:25,000
I i want to %uh the icy congress last
year in Chicago

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,440
and spectrum help CISO

210
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,820
their I was a pickpocket he said you
know we had to do it

211
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,930
my competitors are doing it they're
getting guys i cant touch because

212
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,070
even if I offer more money not all about
the money they want to be set up to do

213
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,970
work

214
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,140
work in the way that they want to do it
and so we had to adapt

215
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,769
and you're gonna start seeing more and
more than by yesterday many people badly

216
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:48,290
against

217
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,620
I mean port there's not yo it ubique US

218
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,899
everyone's going to come do it in breeze
the change right away

219
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,209
it's not going to happen by eventually
you're gonna see more more more people

220
00:11:58,209 --> 00:11:59,980
to go to court

221
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,709
if we think about from the standpoint
threatening shifting threat landscape

222
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,899
were talking about how we no longer
trust the yo the outside we're worried

223
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,269
about we have to actually worry about
Greece interviewed

224
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,120
is going to completely protect us well
been is our internal

225
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,410
really a safe might think it is just
because we control

226
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,529
we start reading everything in the sense
that it's not

227
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,070
its are treating all bark with whether
it's company under weather issues around

228
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,600
as basically being a secure see mobile
security

229
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,630
we start to rethink how we do

230
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,880
can appraise can increase productivity
numerous studies out there

231
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,200
showed users are able to up their
computers and where they want to do

232
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,829
their own work

233
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:44,630
was used there accustomed to using like
to use

234
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,510
generally does increase their
productivity arms on the company's going

235
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,060
to

236
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,720
BYOD for instance VMware saved

237
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,750
$5 million a year on productivity cost
because they're changing

238
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,959
Intel even more impressively I'd and I'm
sorry unblinking

239
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,139
number wanna say with two hundred
million hours

240
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:07,839
India me I'll get you an exact number by
they save about $200 million hours

241
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,740
man-hours in your estimate but they're
switching to be where the

242
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,810
letting people do work in the way that
they wanted

243
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,209
potential cost there are some cost
savings that we talked about you

244
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:23,220
in Kos under control costing standpoint
we don't have this capital expenditures

245
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,089
anymore

246
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:27,480
are and there are even studies out there
for those you think always

247
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,610
unique have to subsidize my employees my
employees data plan for my employees

248
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,920
phone plans

249
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,300
well good study last year and what they
found out about sixty Prince

250
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,449
the people said they're more than
willing to cover their own costs for

251
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,760
is concerned as far as on this concern
they can use their own

252
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,170
you're going to cure onto hell I did it
for years why disused

253
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,560
through my corporate in the desk drawer
I want to carry two phones around

254
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,120
scritto use my own just your and then
green IT

255
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,660
everyone be green we're not buying as
many computers we're not throwing as

256
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,010
many

257
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,430
minor thing but what's good for the
market

258
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,810
so adoption views be waiting the
enterprises some the company's

259
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,240
have beware the in the enterprise year
del spectrum

260
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,649
Intel Cisco VMware the place where I
work

261
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,730
you have it to some extent is just phone
or phone and laptop

262
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,029
be offered and there's numerous other
companies

263
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,600
some big ones

264
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,449
but to make them feel good

265
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:34,620
a pity i for some picking up some
companies feel

266
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,019
a radical disappeared without BYOD
recent

267
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,139
in five years BYOD will be back US thats

268
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,160
doctor since the way from Forster if
you're a chance to read some

269
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,920
her work outstanding beware especially
the way the

270
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,329
and urethra so so I the concepts for the

271
00:14:55,329 --> 00:15:00,639
design are building of for original
research

272
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,019
are now not everyone feels this way BYOD
is an unavoidable

273
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,100
by the CIO no I

274
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,579
which you place your bets to allow
employees to do the job

275
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:14,190
Paul Green from Sheffield City Council
asked that question

276
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,750
is BYOB necessary I'm is beware the
necessary

277
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,880
Nucleus Research unlike every other
research company the world

278
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,149
beware these growing growing they feel
that with the rival Windows 8

279
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:31,279
enterprise have what's eccentrics that
in a price will build the

280
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,420
will grow and BYOD will be quite we
disagree with that statement as most

281
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,709
people do by

282
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,910
apparently to them Windows 8 is the
savior and Messiah

283
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,000
the world and with the Snickers and
laughter I seen other

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,690
feel that way well so something existing
NY

285

focusing on securing the device

288
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,839
why make sure laptop secure we wanna
make sure are

289
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,709
only secure this is cost traditional I T

290
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,759
you know is we pocket in its current for
arm

291
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,949
were talking heavy focus on what the MDM
solutions good

292
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:18,430
MobileIron AirWatch and pride

293
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,899
now and match 360 all those fun things

294
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,959
out there you all get bombarded with the
emails

295
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,300
daily basis arm have your touch

296

device you're controlling device

297
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,660
your me you minimize your risk your data
by securing the and

298
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,009
and you're using uses usually focus on
native

299
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:43,149
interface used solutions I

300
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,170
know they can just gives you control
over it some have

301
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,250
pocketed

302
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,279
can your pocket sections over there only
for the there under the control store

303
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,560
data in there

304
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,889
I'm trying to keep bridge you've seen
some the smartphone penetration testing

305
00:16:58,889 --> 00:16:59,560
parks

306
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,120
know that not be always I'm

307
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,860
biggest searchers approach so with this
a jerk approach starts do is look at

308
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,829
running basically bird mobile

309
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,990
I your client base the point this is
your beady eye

310
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,339
from your Citrix all those companies get
out there and

311
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,850
but the virtual desktop on their arm
biggest problem with a data-centric

312
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,839
approach

313
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,570
while using a laptop no problems at all
piece a cake

314
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,200
those must have tried to use RTP on are
phone

315
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,740
how fun is that is a

316
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,049
last-minute I emergency have to make a
perfect

317
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,900
I really don't feel like going home at
this point and it's 3 a.m. the hacker

318
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,990
on I need to make this change in yes
I've done it

319
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,080
Mooers by arm

320
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,210
it sucks to work so it's not not
conducive to your

321
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,910
in the third approaches applications
this is where things went up go

322
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,610
Application Center kinda combines that
data center feel

323
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,890
but streaming app sense because you use
it

324
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,720
3 Citrix but more almost mobile
situation

325
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,280
native company to base interface mobile
so

326
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,150
touch base applications that you can run
virtualized still stored on the server

327
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,419
side

328
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:20,700
but you're utilizing on your on your
mobile devices

329
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,130
like they are my cues and

330
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,150
the problem with applications in turkey
is very

331
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,470
there's not a lot of people out there
that really

332
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,630
yet closest i've seen the

333
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,090
secure gateway impressive product

334
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,500
to me it's not there yet but it is right
now to me because

335
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,330
VMware as a couple interesting options
out there as well

336
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,720
that to me is where we're gonna see
going in the next 45 years in

337
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,510
its gonna most the more secured

338
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,799
so what we're looking for BrdU when the
rule architecture

339
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,289
is arm combination all those

340
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:06,340
so I call the bridge technology because
its out there more to

341
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,130
bridger way in today applications
approach down

342
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,320
what you like your existing equipment
arm

343
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,429
may be indifferent figuration your wife

344
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:19,840
on use elements is your trust and also
element

345
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,350
not for throwing up printed

346
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,530
I to do ours for a secure BYOD
architecture be believer and strong

347
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,830
written policies

348
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,330
strike controls too often focus just on

349
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,799
controls we forget the fact that
policies are out there to guide

350
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,309
users controls there basically force

351
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,570
in support so always remember that

352
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,080
policies just as important

353
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,789
farmer plus lawsuits we go all that
stuff gets

354
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,100
to have policies in place can be your
goal

355
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,490
lawyers legal advice blight

356
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,179
from what I've heard from warriors
including your professors

357
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,309
classes you're generally putting up

358
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,780
best effort putting showing showing you
were doing everything possible to secure

359
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,820
network

360
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,480
help women aged

361
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,780
so we're doing a user-centric approach
it about user

362
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,770
we want to be we want to be there
helping the user that's why we're not

363
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,539
forcing

364
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:27,400
with a certain architecture giving them
the ability to support

365
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,960
Gordon and ability to do the work amid

366
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,880
so minimal trust we talk about men will
trust it's because

367
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,140
it's based on truss design principles
anyone familiar with Forster no trust

368
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,309
architectures right do some googling
read it

369
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:49,860
3 good I sitcom obese defense built on
the same

370
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,960
exact over excellent group Forster stop
is

371
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,760
paywall but there are some companies
have out there

372
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,850
free marketing giveaway when the fake
email address get down they are

373
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,210
white actual directly white papers more
sinister

374
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,260
research your comp mark by: sitcom like
everything else

375
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,929
they do have haven't publicly excellent

376
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,419
arm so I called minimal trust because
basically

377
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,059
not to trust no trust at this point is
not ready for

378
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,690
the concept of it basically is that
every pack

379
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,409
your network isn't you almost have
central core types which

380
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:33,580
we're doing firewall packet inspection
are

381
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,270
on every packet goes through around

382
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,970
as you deal with network on a regular
basis nor a spot where that might be it

383
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,350
can be difficult

384
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,120
where for small network through provider
level after the pool

385
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,010
this day and age and we know that site
network never going to be for that

386
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,710
beer guys be were difficult some EU

387
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,390
deal in that space item may have some
solution ideas

388
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:02,530
fantastic that's good my research I
wasn't able to find all that much

389
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,010
outside firewalls and not gonna work

390
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,020
most small business network definitely
not good

391
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,409
with report parade food

392
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:17,299
so it's just not ready for prime by ten
years from now

393
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,640
equipment exist so we see minimal trust
because we can't pull off

394
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,720
complete no trust try to do as much

395
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,380
we're combining aspects three main
architect by singer data center

396
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,880
applications got use in the day that
we're gonna control

397
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,990
did within the enterprise not worrying
about joint

398
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,200
on the devices women dated

399
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,870
and we don't want to control the expiry
we want to give the user experience

400
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,200
our goal is to protect our date
internally our goal is to deliver that

401
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,700
users and then

402
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,419
we it's all about insight in-depth
inside about

403
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:01,260
controlling the delivery were inspecting
traffic at data access points

404
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,490
and we're doing enterprise intelligence
and this is going to be hotter and

405
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,440
hotter topic in

406
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,350
present screen know what you're
bombarded with we about it

407
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,030
you know Rs where all those companies
out there

408
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:19,179
are certain to go approach IBM's big
should

409
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,110
as well so there's a lot of information
out there and that's where

410
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,740
really the high-growth areas

411
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,390
I'm this kinda complex is ample about
architecture design

412
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,320
high-level arm use arm

413
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,650
so on the slide

414
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,230
just where we're going for comp

415
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,580
so your six ment trust security layers

416
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,190
of starts out with architecture where
virtualization where

417
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,799
security infrastructure where
application

418
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,520
device user intelligence see the
intelligent players ball

419
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:07,520
bottom impairment because support
everything up

420
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,720
data architecture that are better that's
our

421
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,409
virtual where are logic aware that
basically is where we controlled

422
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:18,820
armor talking about or C&R nasser J bide

423
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,179
I'm databases arm

424
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:27,190
this were folks securing that the from
the polish that you might have in place

425
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,500
for this particular where

426
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,020
are forensic policies so how are we
doing for it to come

427
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,350
she's that we want to make sure we know
about

428
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,750
and then as well as corruption data
stored arm

429
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,929
what day does allow what candidate where
people out

430
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:48,289
what's the policy in place do your under
Nasser seen

431
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:51,380
what drives me to be encrypt how are you
going to do

432
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,179
which party you want hardware-based
encryption software-based encryption

433
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:58,600
on how you want to pick your that when
it comes down to

434
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,190
surprised so again if you're right or
wrong answer

435
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,730
know it depends on what your your
company with your boss

436
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,400
years which think about make sure is
written down

437
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,549
ways that you have identified

438
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:16,210
virtualization where so

439
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,779
mishap this now how many how many of us
a

440
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:23,460
how many have you in the eye entered

441
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,100
while you virtual servers more

442
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,669
okay so

443
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:34,529
based go this is start heading toward

444
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:37,529
why do I like virtualization well one
its generally

445
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:40,690
tends to be a little bit cheaper I find
it easier

446
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,279
box it by malware nation to restore
snapshot and try to rebuild

447
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,840
box in there using Ghost your doing
somewhere stop

448
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,270
I'd reason I like it is

449
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,570
everything in a box using virtual point

450
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,880
we can actually help route traffic
through their

451
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,080
inspection that we're talking about
might need provider level switch

452
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,659
at the center now we can by doings

453
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:10,140
inspection between using from the
virtual so

454
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,779
gives away gives us kind about erotica
way to help do more

455
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,610
inspection network do more securing
track

456
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,770
so we have a virtual server
infrastructure where luxury

457
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:25,130
I'm sorry hypervisors in the virtual
end-user infrastructure which is a

458
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:25,690
virtual

459
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,799
bird so virtual desktop

460
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,850
we won obviously because for BYOD gives

461
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,669
you go the two-way any user that they
want bring in their own way up

462
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:39,059
but with their accessing the data by
using

463
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,400
now so you like

464
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,890
back forcing goes on

465
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,350
exxon users lobbying force as we all
know

466
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,730
arm but that being said its treetop

467
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,990
you areas the virtual applications

468
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,340
where we're doing application based
approaches

469
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,659
yes approach again that's the way things
are mister heading in my opinion

470
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:10,020
wanna solutions out there now actually
does it from the standpoint

471
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,990
day will happen store and you can

472
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,159
boat desktop traditional PC apps

473
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,640
mobile absent apps so I can go in there
I can

474
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,669
sign up App Store download up

475
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:27,470
and it will still be stored on my server
interacting did on my server

476
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,659
streaming I was the main problem i'd

477
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:34,820
at your he may have a way and I i

478
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,520
do more research on the on this
particular vendor to tell you

479
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,240
for sure but there may be a way to do it
wide

480
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,470
we get that kind where we're seeing
going and that's why I think you see

481
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,510
more

482
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,520
Microsoft

483
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,960
virtual appliances being able to build
and start using virtual you

484
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,669
and virtual stacks virtual switching

485
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:01,750
ride

486
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,600
it's over policies goin' going
virtualization layer

487
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,600
our privacy policy big fan putting
privacy policy how many viewed

488
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,110
me a big deal with just in deal with the
end users

489
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,130
doing alright

490
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,659
advocate privacy policy for in use
reason why there are many core president

491
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,440
that will tell you if you don't say your
network is able

492
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,919
wondered if you don't see their email
acceptable being searched

493
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,010
technically they haven't right to
privacy and therefore big buyer for

494
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,549
something

495
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,320
you might be liable get court case not
aware

496
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,380
just based on past present there it's a
good thing always

497
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,789
just say this is what's expected you

498
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:51,799
this is the case going to look at your
email indian Prime I want

499
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,940
your where this now you know so you no
longer have expected right to privacy

500
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,659
acceptable use of use policies were you
allowed

501
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,850
the one work don't look for porn on the
network don't download

502
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,899
mp3 only use Facebook during

503
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:13,760
X amount of times that would be
acceptable

504
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,340
deep into security infrastructure
anywhere with this is our traditional

505
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,130
different way arm this is our defense in
depth we've been doing for years from

506
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,669
the policies that support on this level

507
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:28,059
acceptable use privacy policy but then
we certainly

508
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,100
BYOD we talk about support

509
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,289
this is much concern to some people
become place in

510
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:39,240
in cost he will support user bring your
own device

511
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:46,240
so you do a BYOD you support year

512
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,220
way do support now

513
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,080
okay as one word no other way to do this
some other companies out there

514
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,230
they actually tell you hey give you X
amount of money to buy this laptop

515
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,620
you to buy an extended warranty next
three years

516
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,490
network a break now it's not the company
issued application

517
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,360
guess where you're going to get textured

518
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,679
some companies do it from the standpoint
be able give you a choice of five or six

519
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,020
I'd

520
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,360
devices and that's what they will
support so they might say he will sport

521
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,510
a mac book pro

522
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,890
support HP support block

523
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,289
anything outside the purview network

524
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:30,460
support so there's no right or wrong way
to do it

525
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,990
my personal opinion is that nowadays
people are

526
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,120
we yet more more people are computer
savvy

527
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,960
armed weeks to the point where they can

528
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,450
call to help desk be able to pixel

529
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,020
on their computers I'm I can you go

530
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,120
that's how I want not everyone likes
approach

531
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,140
there's no way the wrong answer their
what you need fine

532
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,039
you want to do it big thing is getting
by an

533
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,360
sheer because we all know how sea level

534
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,769
white embassy or room I apologize but

535
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,419
we on almost you like to you know
sometimes

536
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,510
circumvent rules to get special would

537
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,440
pouring rain course secure people go

538
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,600
yes sir how may I help you today because
I don't want to get fired

539
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,600
thrown outta my ass so yes so we're
going to take your view because that's

540
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,830
what we do

541
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,940
I and then changed parties were
acceptable changes how do we

542
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,730
we she changed organization we have to
fill out forms are changes only done on

543
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,630
Wednesdays

544
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,390
on the full moon when blood sky is
hanging in there and I

545
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,610
metaphor just got thrown out the window
arm

546
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,519
so change policy have an idea of how
you're doing changes on their

547
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,630
document document document

548
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,649
make sure that you are make sure your
users under know how

549
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:57,440
changes are stick to that policy in the
big thing going back to policies

550
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,279
Paul herb byerly there needs to be
replica questions for those violations

551
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,659
my same fire someone for clicking on the
wrong website first

552
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,289
I'm if you're doing security awareness
training

553
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:12,539
you're doing testing guy gets fished
five or six times in

554
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,679
your testing there needs to be some
replication

555
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,120
whether to write up with their term
whatever clearly not painted

556
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,529
so you need to have this replication
need to be in force

557
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:29,470
otherwise your policy to was and in
between good

558
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,250
people ministers circumventing you gonna
run into my opinion

559
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,880
when that happens worst because then you

560
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,019
might think you're secure you're really
not you're really

561
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:45,140
I ipsi yes web filtering

562
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,269
one wheel filtering on the other stuff
because warmer in our network we stop

563
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:52,559
network in the goal even though we're
not

564
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,789
is worried about the outside everything
like that

565
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:01,740
protector network and so are the reason
why different dept still

566
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,029
aspect of this architecture is because
I'm because I'm basically supporting

567
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:10,620
data shell that's my that's my
stronghold that's my

568
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,850
you can't penetrate this sec my
quarterback you can't break into that

569
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,299
shit

570
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:19,679
what they want to protect I we still
want to try them

571
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,039
as many articles place for the way

572
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,600
even though a particular day level which
the one hand with what bill to

573
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,769
get some again some additional

574
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:34,120
multi-factor authentication I obviously
most

575
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,769
using all dapper the networks

576
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:41,230
should be no idea I strongly recommend
stern look

577
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,640
what factor in their I

578
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,260
in this is in any networking BYOD we
start looking at certificate even if

579
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,529
they're

580
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,990
custom generated with Microsoft are just

581
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,840
additional layer of security in there
but if you go out where you're doing

582
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,850
certificates with some CA

583
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:05,010
internally doing tokens biometrics yeah
those are expensive but they can

584
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,089
operational security in their we all
know how hell

585
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,230
how really protected password right we
on

586
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,079
so I can the point now I'm using 25
character

587
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:18,480
housework it's ridiculous it easy for me
to remember but

588
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,690
let's be honest most users very damp

589
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,329
with six some I don't like

590
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,919
I friends do it. for the on

591
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,919
and I think they're up to 60

592
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,260
descended on and there's you're
overweight Street

593
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,579
just Harry rising all this stuff

594
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:42,250
some word so make major new users
targeting factor in their

595
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,599
you can help make it easier on them make
it more secure

596
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,869
people with the 13 GP you work

597
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:52,190
servers that are out there just UN you
know

598
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,720
pure hate know exactly what I'm talking
about that very impressive

599
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,000
or go watch the password cracking Def
Con again

600
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,050
watches go draw drop held press

601
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,369
guys the border gateway devices are ours

602
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:09,760
firewalls how many have you actually
segments your

603
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,810
networks all right

604
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:17,880
how many have you only segment by doing
beware

605
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,470
so when I say segmentation you enter
good start I recommend putting and

606
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,480
either segmentation firewalls

607
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,800
are doing we saw your layer 3 switches
access Wes

608
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,260
really putting in there and winning what
traffic get to those

609
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,920
just an interview and up there doesn't
necessarily mean it securely segment

610
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,720
putting in there and putting and so you
can access gonna win

611
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,480
a big thing to remember is is is all the
stuff for proof hack proof

612
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,560
absolutely not goes to mitigate as much
risk as possible

613
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,560
I'm not pushing up ever to say that
something is happening I think

614
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,089
anyone says that is pretty much asking
for the guide

615
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:59,410
to come down strike their network now
but goal is to try to minimize as much

616
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,400
as possible

617
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,140
goes out there to sit there and bass we
go

618
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,140
hey I got the script kiddie I got this I
get

619
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,849
now we're out their help so that's why
we put in

620
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:16,240
our network switches devices extra
Wireless and him our devices

621
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,420
i wanna talk about it from our network
based about types

622
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,839
we have stuff sitting on the gateway
this is like I am poor

623
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,200
like are stop both you operates from

624
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,570
outside in perspective leaders
signature-based

625
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,680
when I talked with the internal our
detection

626
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,829
these are things like Byram by Reid
operate more

627
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:42,599
rest level signature aspects by they
also help with this call back

628
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,210
Burwood I actually like combining both
problem

629
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,540
network for you she do by

630
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,579
you know even though you have in our
gateway something

631
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:55,940
work actually a book protection

632
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,150
really help there's some overlap but it
does offer

633
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,220
protection she knows per i've seen

634
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:11,220
what the gateway and the internal device
and very interested

635
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,369
application where stalking applications
so

636
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:17,500
mystery patrols in my phone here we talk
to a pricey

637
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,260
will use in forensics Indian policy

638
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,470
what kinda mobile device management are
we doing on a mobile device is now

639
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,030
we talked about not being the vice
century here but what do I do

640
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,420
yeah argued

641
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,300
very specific reason what I want him
even know I said at the very start

642
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,550
concerned about ok tried arm

643
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,310
application servers are from her back
and yep network centric applications

644
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,180
which is

645
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,970
client-server model in that particular
case web-centric were all

646
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:52,060
web-centric cloud internet-based our
mobile app cedar

647
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,630
first party designer third parties I'm
wide

648
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,700
store but there are companies do go out
there and do mobile

649
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,359
your mobile make their own house

650
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:07,609
out there for their boys you wise worker

651
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:11,130
keep in mind application whale where
secured

652
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,500
so i doing dynamic behavior detection
basically based on the behavior the

653
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,060
application

654
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,980
baseline do security making security I'm

655
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,349
why detection using

656
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:27,770
normal baseline on the application

657
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,400
application rap this year wrapping
basically

658
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,570
were taking the internal application
wrapping around help

659
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,010
secure secure show

660
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,180
cool software out there in technology do
that

661
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,750
quite the application approach that
we're talking about

662
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,420
can take away little bit away from about
great great

663
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,540
way a great start

664
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,700
user device so talking about just how

665
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,119
policies that is more a policy where
because by Scissor

666
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,180
simply you know lap bones

667
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,390
effing any device users going to access
on

668
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,050
work arm it's there and point

669
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,630
so so policies in place and technology

670
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,030
in point the OP I would be the OPI no
its not the greatest

671
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,369
technology out there people have a lot
issues with

672
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:25,450
that being said its start help

673
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,680
some stop walks data going i'd

674
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,700
post me to go

675
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,930
assuming any tool is going to help you
100 percent four ish

676
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,190
we can catch some stuff it's better than
where you were before

677
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,119
you obviously the cost-benefit analysis
and see whether my potential losses word

678
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,099
for them about you happen to recommend
reading about

679
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:50,570
quality risk

680
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,300
me up doable just understand about
expectancy is

681
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,260
and the problem

682
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,369
really will help change your view on
secure you coming tonight

683
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:08,460
weird course by with him better than you

684
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,880
so in point security we're talking now
where hips

685
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,450
comes

686
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,359
there so important firewalls encryption

687
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,520
summit the I'm controls on their

688
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,730
our administrative controls so
ministering what where they allowed to

689
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,730
control

690
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,890
I support policy privacy we talked about

691
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,920
forensics the big one with the vice

692
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,930
on the advice company buys were not
worry about forensic

693
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,550
device we could you should buy
self-portrait

694
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:45,400
are you should be willing through the
computer forensic investigation

695
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,690
of them well some won't be

696
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,010
secret their signature an right they're
usually

697
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,450
screwed so you need to really go out
there you need

698
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:00,670
fine policy arm with we go

699
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:05,089
always whenever implement policies
always remember we got make sure that

700
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:08,819
complied state laws federal laws if your
international

701
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:12,109
national otherwise might rent patrol

702
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:16,890
because we all know in like France and
Europe privacy controls lot stricter

703
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:20,020
US yourself

704
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,630
on so your forensics you wanna see hey
in my state

705
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,569
is Wiegel for me to be able to print
action

706
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:31,109
you'd for men it is a condition

707
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:34,650
I'm using that's kinda weird policy

708
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,670
so look at that in there again right or
wrong answers

709
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,400
just make a decision you want to do for
indexing go with it

710
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,710
make sure we subsidy policy you
subsidize any

711
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,069
any part of your boys purchasing
employed get

712
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:53,180
no right or wrong birmingham police
standpoint you're awesome when you give

713
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,290
me money to buy

714
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,160
toys you're awesome I I say every
syllable out there

715
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,349
do that give us money by I understand
the ones that go

716
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:07,119
yeah I completely understand it but we
do appreciate it when you do so just

717
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,349
a use of or decryption policies do you
require device

718
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:14,650
before encrypt laptops I C yes

719
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,460
not hard her there doesn't really hurt
their end-user device

720
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,450
Corp its actually better security for
them even on their own

721
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:28,079
and it easy to do so I i say your help
them out

722
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,310
encrypt do a whole disk encryption or
weaker

723
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,800
thereby between this group

724
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,500
obviously mobile devices you if it will
support it

725
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,050
obviously word Android born

726
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,190
said

727
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,619
I'm so side if you need required

728
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:52,550
corruption force and then also software
if you require certain

729
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,819
pieces of so for example you're using
your

730
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:59,030
lap with my data word from

731
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,470
application point of view require you to
have encryption

732
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:06,069
I require you an hour

733
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:09,290
are you

734
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,760
hips on I require you to have firewall
on your

735
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,849
and now one thing I will say

736
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:21,050
do you start requiring some this very
you know stringent

737
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:25,099
in point security consider subsidizing
the cost

738
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:28,690
not that expensive purchase

739
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,460
in securities you know give interviews

740
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,670
as part of the problem your cause we
talkin you know

741
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,220
20 fifty dollars per year per user

742
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,280
to me it's a good and sleep much better
security within the community out there

743
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,089
so

744
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:48,310
for those who don't Ron just because
you're running a Mac

745
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:52,790
not mean you can our virus

746
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:56,319
assumption I love Apple use max

747
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,410
home it's one of my yeah I i love thee
what the architectural the

748
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,290
enterprise I will be computers but

749
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:08,640
don't make assumptions out completely

750
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,310
bone it's completely immune to buyers

751
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,750
now come the intelligence where this is
my my favorite where

752
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,270
under the those you know schoolhouse
rock you there is about knowledge is

753
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,250
power

754
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,430
arm so we talk with the coaches where I
was

755
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,210
some people love them some people think
their waste think their waste

756
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:34,230
time actually run their program official
my pen

757
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,630
are I talk about you needed allied

758
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,790
because you need to have people working
people going through

759
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:47,660
working for that with the correlation

760
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,930
some people can pull it off helped you

761
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,329
wide you give someone the more complex

762
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:59,839
York side world to me really

763
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,089
arm but reason we have seven there's
together more intelligence

764
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:07,560
be able to take logged in for or other
devices be able to correlate

765
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,079
information declassification with
classifications based on certain key

766
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,450
words or

767
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,300
manual packing we hey state is public

768
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,920
state as well only internal private this
is for eyes only only certain

769
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,680
security group based on the same concept
military government

770
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,310
the I

771
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,250
really like the request maker D op

772
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,030
I know this is tagged as classified well
guess what really don't wanna going

773
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,930
outta my network

774
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:41,310
pike again this idea people

775
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:45,030
network level and going to do it
importantly will you

776
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:50,660
level you'd used by Tim point

777
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,180
yo specific to the one you're using is
just

778
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,829
you'd so it so you have to subsidize

779
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:01,730
the OP a wide

780
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,520
on Dr and this myself a bitch
arrangement

781
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,530
this is actually something crowd

782
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:13,339
there at their place and what they're
doing was

783
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:16,869
time that the OP sense something that
was

784
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:21,109
protected it would actually redirected
to a Dr M's

785
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:24,589
solution would the RM rights on to that
data

786
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:28,410
in out so I was like

787
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,740
pretty cool arms think about their and

788
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,410
no something right there to help African
additional

789
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:38,660
protection access control

790
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,849
basic access control on talkback strong

791
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:45,849
we on just mix

792
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:48,980
gooden's sock arm

793
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,640
and stopped goods only reason I Y coming
in there

794
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,030
goes back to the intelligence level if I
can profile that

795
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,550
device my network profile side

796
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,829
gives me more information Ancelotti
begins

797
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:08,589
getting that information does kidnapping
bypassed

798
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:12,550
absolutely in those you but the Pony
Express Inc

799
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:16,020
has bypassed open their works pretty
damn well

800
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,970
so is definitely by passable but

801
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,089
again sometimes goes to get walking
fruit

802
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:26,710
next help your profile

803
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,040
a mobile device management cell you know
I said don't worry bout vice

804
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,559
why do I have a basement two reasons

805
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,930
one from a security standpoint our
mobile device means you can help protect

806
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,530
Joe breaks roots refund devices

807
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,640
and yes is my friend Tom there pointed
out

808
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,339
there's ways to bypass but again we're
talking about the majority views

809
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:56,589
he's actually put in some to mobile
device people

810
00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:59,660
that is true this trip by

811
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:03,160
again the point going down there on
their having on

812
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,099
there is you are stuck casual there

813
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:13,260
again if you can prevent some people
it's going to give you better

814
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,530
if you go from the viewpoint at some
point will be breached

815
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,530
then you're going on the viewpoint
action

816
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:23,420
as well as prevention then even if
someone does bypass you

817
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,980
you're still problem tried

818
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,930
rest again my print on there has
actually form the Indian companies and

819
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,819
hopefully they will be better

820
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:36,599
he said that they were cool

821
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,319
and then I you know administrative
control their out there by

822
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,460
policy where

823
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,640
on midge within policy quite
intelligence

824
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,150
Richards within the party the opium

825
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:55,450
all the other is for the India Williams
posture posture

826
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,809
you can depart your assessment for
profiling on the devices again

827
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:03,480
more information main reasons to help

828
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,170
YouTube you see something free like your

829
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:10,700
said there re beams

830
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,520
something simple I

831
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,109
so there's some possible starting point
for technologies

832
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:22,630
this kind this is like a technologies
within the first six months

833
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,119
are we have existing technology may
already have in place like most you're

834
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:27,190
running held them

835
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,410
border gateway devices work application

836
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:33,500
servers network centric applications

837
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,640
model using most in place on

838
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,119
prices work small businesses

839
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:43,940
with end users and most stop

840
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,599
arm yes when are mystery again

841
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:53,710
my my goal and my philosophy

842
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:57,430
technology controls are there to support
maintain

843
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:00,490
force ministry policy so the first

844
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,790
I make sure in places that we have exact
with goals network

845
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,530
are goals for security can former users
in

846
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:11,020
place from buried was quick

847
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,260
misjudged

848
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,059
to the new technologies cancer
implementing within this first section

849
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,470
doesn't mean you're doing

850
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,750
one possible way there is no right or
wrong way

851
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,960
one possible I virtual desktop

852
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,150
look at segmentation devices you
recommend if you are

853
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,380
not segmenting segment

854
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,670
start out yo obviously UN what you doing

855
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:41,089
the very least most you're probably
between

856
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:45,619
3 switch they might be out there I'm not
familiar with anywhere three

857
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:49,559
we some kinda pack three

858
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:54,490
anyone i could think about offers so
spend the time went

859
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:57,579
head and

860
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:01,559
Road protect out there because from
simple standpoint

861
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,839
hacker bridge network make it more
difficult

862
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:07,950
to if you now we're a break work well

863
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,510
you can block poured level American help

864
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,819
from going said so

865
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:18,099
just a good reason to do it good general
overall security

866
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:22,640
and should be pretty much freedom to
sleep

867
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,670
web center caps you know cloud-based as
we all know that's a big

868
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:31,790
term reside

869
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,220
something to consider those things
mobile app then

870
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,190
from technologies %um

871
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:42,380
after their first your day month we have
our existing stuff

872
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,010
place in what more virtual servers

873
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,270
commercial appliances no rehab IPS
Walter unit was

874
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,520
the PC under here you already have

875
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,910
summer multi-factor anti-malware big
thing we want to do is reassess our

876
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:58,700
application

877
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,500
so the application place in with your
setup is a better word

878
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,500
start moving the application away from
networks injured

879
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,700
your application is we can move into the
cloud

880
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,700
comfortable well

881
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,500
you saw for service type mister the
private cause I could be better

882
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,530
recessed I can't tell you what best for
your network

883
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:24,540
you can you not you're going to pretend
no by

884
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:29,540
that being said you know reassessing
making

885
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,460
gold I mean classification finally

886
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,700
you know the jury never stop stop
improving

887
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,920
yes bad on but I keep reassessing what
you'd adding

888
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,579
new application layer security axe
control the RM

889
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:48,740
actor observe new offerings look at
industry

890
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,900
good examples the securian talked about
started

891
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:57,599
come out consumer corporate commercial
base

892
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,109
and reduced seen it grow more and more
fide

893
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:06,589
so Skrillex are going to be a big thing
my pin other technology out there

894
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:09,940
just as important putting

895
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,089
addition security might be able to
replace existing

896
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:18,300
and make your network major security
better

897
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,230
as well future research directions

898
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,790
there certain industry-specific
difficulties that may have to overcome

899
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:30,660
for example medical sample some places
where you're not allowed

900
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,260
actions everything we'll have a way to

901
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,400
cash we went to a problem we overcome

902
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,819
and arm

903
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:45,140
field testing the architecture Longwood
laughing on this

904
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,599
virtual sapir

905
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,670
doing case stays around specific vendor
offerings

906
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:57,119
you know we're focusing just Cisco just
checkpoint combination

907
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,260
somewhere with Cisco walk around

908
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,160
on see what works so goes you dump

909
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,640
case studies bird so help care industry

910
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,630
government work

911
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:18,150
I'm so the thing on her weave today's

912
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,000
yes this is design I came up with

913
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,390
based on research your design out there

914
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:29,520
is a perfect design can't be hacked no
anyone tell you could

915
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,290
any because nothing is

916
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,940
as we've seen even even the Iranian

917
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:41,319
you are personally not connected not
connected to the

918
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,470
internet bridge scare for rooms

919
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,349
you know not connect to the internet
supposed to be the most secure the

920
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:49,099
secure

921
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:53,220
got breached and that's how we ended up
with many in the WikiLeaks case

922
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,829
it possible nothing is so

923
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:59,869
and goal this presentation is go
implement this

924
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:03,780
as is it's just to give you idea look at
this is one approach

925
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,790
numerous approaches out there big
believer in research

926
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:10,910
hope research any community is to build
upon

927
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:14,400
research look at the research see hey

928
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,480
this is a good idea stupid idea are I
think I can make this work

929
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,270
between way make it better and that's
where thats thats

930
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:26,480
take go with it always be assessing what
you looking

931
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,690
for are you looking for more

932
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:36,690
that's everything today will on my part
do you have any questions

933
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,970
right thank you
