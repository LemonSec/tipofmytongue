1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,820
appreciate Carolina after

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:14,820
speed very hard act to follow I

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,330
about me

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,840
network double impact

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,800
armored secure ok

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,039
smart transport were

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,210
optical cable us

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,749
things like that the penetration testing

9
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:41,019
I do get into that when I'm ball

10
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:48,019
30 that's rude architecture on the pen
testing

11
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:56,100
mostly with this presentation is about

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,119
everyone's talking about the all these
advanced threats

13
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,900
talking about help

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,940
whenever seems like whenever somebody
gets hurt their plane

15
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,290
really when are getting school

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,610
basic just come over term be

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,980
to go and lay out this is what people
really you might have some

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,060
has a and skills in some cases come in a
lot of the places I go

19
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,660
an broke real basic things

20
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,190
per million really drive home tried

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,480
presentations trust relationships

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,100
one more mister

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,470
export trust relationships
interdependencies

24
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,630
you can take on for

25
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,830
law report in

26
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,590
loves because flatter

27
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,470
hard decide

28
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:08,470
defaults here's networks rolled out

29
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,099
for smart brought words at the top

30
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,040
control top services

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,760
were you CP server your policies are

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,989
lawful intercept IP based

33
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,529
art triple servers right

34
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:35,189
indication

35
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,790
the automated provisioning my up

36
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,480
tell with till provisioning for smart
grid the whole point there

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
is for from roles connected

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,459
from you know all the way smart what
happens there

39
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,730
goal

40
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,230
pay your bill talk to the billing server

41
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,040
the billing server doesn't talk to the
SCADA system around your smart

42
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,879
toward build system

43
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,060
smart power

44
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:22,060
Notre which is great but the problem

45
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,109
is you see these different layers

46
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:34,109
different layers we'll go from there
were managed

47
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,329
transferred inside

48
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,419
whatever the core transport network all
the way down into distribution

49
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,939
aggregation where passive optical

50
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:51,109
words the

51
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,379
in some cases two homes or

52
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,650
traditional side

53
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,569
the problem

54
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:06,540
wanna drive home was example have all
that

55
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,870
into integration that's available

56
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,069
workflows somebody target network

57
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:18,890
take over in bigger concern of

58
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:23,570
educator really gotta go mill now those

59
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,540
the remote access is in her going to
exist

60
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,710
build words because you which
manufactured

61
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,000
ASI typically is cool

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,170
to Remo access

63
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,050
to their system application times
organizations

64
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,370
this infrastructure about Sun

65
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,960
launcher you drop your system you can
drop in your

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,960
your motorhome Windows box straight to
the Internet bypass all sacred

67
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,290
you soon drop

68
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,760
secure course you get

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,860
internal text where

70
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,860
escape the

71
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,470
reference architectures us federal
system

72
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,560
skied talking

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,560
manufactured yes

74
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,700
but the ANC standard architecture

75
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,740
we should words secure

76
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,560
pictures corporate word drop

77
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,150
skate the year old

78
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,180
to core

79
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,330
scale work with rows down

80
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,600
next level your RT appeals

81
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,880
devices actually control rule with

82
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,750
camp relays flip switches

83
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,050
X on down

84
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,050
now this looks Rivermark text and
Portugal firewalls between

85
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,440
the corporate network and stadiums

86
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,800
a person till space

87
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,800
when I saw you talk about power
generator talk about the distributors

88
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,950
doesn't exist

89
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,630
the firewalls between

90
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,600
corporate networks in this guide I'm
starting to see the fire was put in

91
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,860
place

92
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,260
record com what you comin

93
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:59,520
is would

94
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,210
NT 4.0 multi home

95
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,110
one leg in the corporate network 1

96
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,440
is there see talk to some %uh the head

97
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,820
promise me firewall red

98
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,920
firewood

99
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,470
just still

100
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,840
so we'll see things like that and at the
same time

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,020
holes

102
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,160
architectures over to the right in the
center the

103
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,710
vendors won't back toward

104
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,050
operators will happen is there if it's
no

105
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,240
legacies their party bowed not still in
this thing

106
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,160
modems USB modems they'll be there

107
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,400
covered in dust hopefully they're being
disabled when they're not

108
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,419
hopefully some remembered

109
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,130
hopefully there's a law

110
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,259
Richard

111
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,370
what will happen many cases marxism

112
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,180
to come so free access

113
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,180
work in

114
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,120
the big concern heavy

115
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,539

their trust relations you're inheriting
whatever here

121
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,140
you know how this connection some
questions

122
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,980
Tom no appt

123
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,260
required this is real life

124
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,839
I was talking to you was working

125
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,480
nato transport was working on the Metro
Ethernet

126

network resolves network issues between
locations

127
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,740
mister talking manager ask to me but you
skated

128
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,709
announcement questions of

129
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:34,990
yours I'll with architect faster

130

help you it is plain mustard dollar with
I need to go back and say

140
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,380
this is after hour earlier in the day
already had a corner because I because I

141
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,959
discovered on their firewall

142
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,120
that their billing system its it secured

143
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
the billing system put in a cloud-based
system for me drop

144
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,579
firewall I you can't make this up

145
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,699
the firewall rules for permit

146
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,800
than only thing protecting

147
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,910
internal what they were doing no static

148
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,270
translations ago then a gold

149
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,329
free the inside about it

150
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:55,880
about you the paddles works

151
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,930
floor this

152
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,980
like like I said by stop be

153
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,750
base also talk about the

154
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,029
with the basics and

155
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,130
the conversation with the manager
profession

156
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,540
burn ask mister offer my services

157
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,660
to free

158
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,399
would expensive result

159
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,930
is like we think this is secure really
challenged

160
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,430
consider question Arctic

161
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,550
but

162
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,000
the part of the conversation to me

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,300
the guys at work for because when they
go hun

164
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:57,300
on red with when they go honey

165
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,160
stay thank you very monitor this case

166
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,319
her phone

167
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:08,589
however things up

168
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:15,589
things brings old

169
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,249
if possible or survivors

170
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,559
Marion

with till really serves surf

172
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,870

here's an architecture

191
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,500
example users likes utilities

192
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,560
in many cases where smart

193
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,260
were of ever since the polls

194
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,730
and Cicero now for the got all the band
with were also wanna go harder

195
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,430
boys cable TV all these additional
services

196
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,750

salsa which office just

202
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,410
report back what's interesting is the

203
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,510
the vendors always walls access

204
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,120
these networks because drop class

205
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,850
college class polls Sol switch

206
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,240
both switches run a hose were used to
running power

207
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,650
could allowed

208
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:25,130
business bonds will happen

209
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,880
or are gone come in

210
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,620
top cover for me thing their normal

211

internet connection bpm as

212
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,970
that's great that's okay as long as it
bigger or

220
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,410
these networks hi

221
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,730
hi some kind with APT

222
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,700
SSH brute force

223
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,820
is a report on relentless

224
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,400
nonstop this is a report with the lose

225
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,160
they will remote access wherever their
travels

226
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,840
the field engineers are when you call
help

227
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,760
said stay hard

228
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,020
a seal specific location can access

229
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,780
sir have it open where the courage

230
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,410
well if they can reach you so can remain
there look

231
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,780
would for what I've to what i've seen

232
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,010
is when they depart they'd only found
out about

233
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,020
buckles and these cases the these

234
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,480
connections some cases may be more or

235
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,420
very connection what time they only
found out after

236
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,800
some called sees

237
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,859
another example

238
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,790
just heels

239
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,410
stirs Escala

240
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,560
Ring Pop there was a time for ago became

241
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,830

cell someone throughout this
architecture sry

246
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:01,300
here so basically

247
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,520
which for SEC for emergency

248
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,510
11 services you have re redundancy
phones were

249
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,200
so what happens if you're for the source
business which

250
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,360
farmer RAM between

251
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,250
lawyers geographic first

252
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,550
architecture calls rod which one strand

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,130
one terminated just

254
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,570
from both let's go to class back

255
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:43,570
problem see this person some copper

256
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,530
sure was wrong art

257
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,929
took upon themselves the plan Coast

258
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:02,810
polls Cape

259
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,630
two cities are down until

260
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,650
armored trucks from 23 states over

10 APT there

263
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:26,080
but persistent

264
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,250
here's another architecture

265
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,380
basic basic architecture

266
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,680
Togo were

267
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,620
they're offering all kinds services even
offering

268
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:46,620
transport services to smart there in the
boys are in

269
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,840
service say

270
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,480
except billing system want

271
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,920
whoever does the billing system trusted

272
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,030
no matter how smart you are much

273
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,100
of place miles

274
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,350
work is not secured yes well as

275
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,670
wasn't this case with system

276
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,870
so their extra

277
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,270
all bill paying system

278
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,560
internal bill i'm talking about.

279
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,590
real you name it it's all on this one

280
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,700
system conduit all the way through the
firewall

281
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,700
to the system Road this case got some at
the time record

282
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,130
pursued box

283
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,160
polio the system from there

284
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,160
last stop but what's really scary again

285
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,360
trust relationship center immigration
that billing system how things operate

286
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,880
with make an order

287
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,070
all those all

288
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,090
intelligence great for

289
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,090
over to the right into other systems the
operations

290
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,720
work they weren't or

291
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,740
those top services are set from existed

292
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,910
to more work from that

293
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,000
to go were dominoes just fill

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,420
I have never said

295
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,160
taxes please stop

296
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,540
or to stop

297
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,790
but after that after

298
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,200
that happen we always good

was crazy figured out what was going on

344
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:24,349
just basic to go

345
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:31,349
together work stocks

346
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,680
here's an example this was

347
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,200
recent in South America friends

348
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,370
experienced their case

349
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,749
some

350
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:54,830
this case

351
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,039
people two different cases

352
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:06,039
this occurred years ago because they did
not have

353
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,990
strong control control management

354
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,320
plane separation services architected

355
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,929
were so that the control plane

356
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:23,340
security lockdown monitor properly

357
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,049
an individual was able to right scripts

358
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:32,980
target older so 10 the gas called relief

359
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,519
packet inspection monitoring

360
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:40,360
capability secured

361
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,860
subscribers self

362
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:49,820
before thousands sir

363
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,830
the other guy they did not have
monitoring

364
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,840
monitor phones switch slide

365
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,840
realize what happened 6,000 what
happened this case the gym

366
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,509
pop so hours backdoor

367
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,590
passwords secure though

368
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,799
access to management should

369
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,799
so the guy was able to get in there
start changed

370
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,830
ask record were

371
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,080
you

372
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,759
try science ventures

373
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,779
his website to the customers

374
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:42,779
switch this is

375
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:48,019
this is a strange voicing this once
again this goes back to the whole

376
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,419
walking down the Control

377
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,919
services all the way from

378
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,589
inner job the core

379
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:59,999
distribution all the way down to
scrubber

380
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:03,879
word all

381
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:09,799
in this case enterprise Corporate
broadband customer

382
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,809
starts the we're

383
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:18,529
Jeep legacy

384
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:22,950
be because role router bits

385
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,650
floor

386
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,840
have hot customer problem past route

387
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,360
water put in place so pool

388
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,550
for back in place resources like this

389
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,940
resentful hard

390
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,950
OC 380 connection

391
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,460
pretty much all work

392
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,620
think has was really interested so

393
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,700
somebody go pop hope it was peace

394
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,080
some customer

395
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,980
employees this location

396
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,210
sophistication starter sit in this
traffic directly

397
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,860
legacy BGP router to see people

398
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,060
17 calls crash

399
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,260
taking a lot of services reserves

400
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,910
because I get the world hurry the router

401
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,120
control plane was not logged so someone
like an internal subscriber

402
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:35,120
user should

403
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,020
basic

404
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,170
here's one game

405
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:47,320
back on the vendors that utility when
this happens

406
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,900
when used to build

407
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,700
his head terminations see

408
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,580
yes which is a fancy cable router talk
to you

409
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,980
so as its terminated DSL

410
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,020
router turns into a broad accessor

411
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,380
Cable Guy to see tsk cable terminations

412
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:17,010
me just talk to it's very important
though

413
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,510
who is this a router cake

414
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,370
faces so they're doing the

415
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,830
router this vendor milled

416
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,130
bpm connection router there's for

417
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,220
project that they had back

418
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,770
ralph is what turns out looks like they
got

419
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,810
through that first relationship

420
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,360
whoever pop road crossing pop

421
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,410
billing system integration the locals

422
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,500
time I wasn't

423
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,750
picture about all things

424
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,770
court

425
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,520
rocks the guys drop

426
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,030
once a until review after served

427
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,740
said

428
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,650
my question

429
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,770
so still myself today whoever God

430
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,160
which assisted

431
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,900
established I have not seen this

432
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,520
along this is would

433
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,150
concern we're secured

434
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,390
networks testing works tried

435
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,880
our customers better secure one concerns
I solved

436
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,970
cases if they're if they're able to

437
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,760
if because

438
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,610
how these cases architect

439
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,140
was the stop somebody from attacking

440
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,410
service with you till you're 80

441
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,110
opening of after one

442
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,580
utility Tiger networks stop

443
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,980
going back back used to west into
another

444
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,280
vendors network cases long drop

445
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,350
the same no problem there's no
segmentation

446
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:34,170
work it's all cool everybody's pack back

447
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:40,999
source connected as applied

448
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,190
mean if you have a legacy

449
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:50,190
were if word go back up

450
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,309
Laird

451

452
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,169
to layer to segmentation

453
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:07,590
control ability for sir inside

454
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:14,590
there's a real world scenarios 0

455
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,750
transport in this case were

456
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:35,660
really good were performed really well
element management system

457
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,210
network specifically for their heart it
was really nice

458
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,000
the customer to

459
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,690
the hardware really easy for the
customer point click

460
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:53,490
were problem had more people

461
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,080
Paul inside the company with the
organization was so into

462
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,690
the guys who Eunice goals security
devices

463
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,010
understood the gym

464
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,600
stole I'll be home

465
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,210
server call transport network

466
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,490
as over half a million dollars invested

467
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:21,520
secured harbors and somebody discovered

468
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,140
assisted SSH

469
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:29,550
Forster somebody else owns the call

470
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,669
transport for the whole were doesn't
matter

471
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:39,669
happy secure if you're there where to
secure

472
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,669
things like is really get back to
problem

473

security policy how things are good

475
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,150
if you don't bring in your system

480
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:25,710
yes armored here's an example

481
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,089
in were architecture for managing

482
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:41,260
could be

483
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,950
all the services same pop segmentation

484
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:50,910
3 to protect

485
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,450
were I want to suggest

486
00:35:54,450 --> 00:36:01,450
experience seen very strong focus if
this is the way

487
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:06,529
Arctic work go to

488
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:10,650
two-factor authentication strong
emphasis on

489
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,299
everything when it comes to you
accessing anything

490
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:20,650
for monitor question some really strong

491
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,349
anything out there

492
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,089
happens at you to see

493
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:33,619
because summers commander

494
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:37,900
commoner is a good chance where
resources

495
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,960
management here's what I prefer

496
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,089
realistic for budget culture

497
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:55,210
person his culture network devices or

498
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,630
price cultural

499
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,900
sometimes hard but in this case

500
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,789
more secure way

501
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:13,859
were is to use and obey connections
terminal server

502
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:18,930
a lot of the routers and switches today

503
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:23,210
servers management HP

504
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:30,210
Cisco devices

505
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,160
the first have a ser

506
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,180
inside there

507
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:45,619
going to be jump did

508
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:49,660
the whole were infrastructure that way

509
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,359
network of seems system

510
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,470
yes logs extremely secure

511
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:03,369
so that someone can SwitchEasy this

512
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:07,170
this is over get back into the
enterprise man

513

myself this is a top working following

network itself change were

573
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:06,690
when you'd

00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,700
whenever greater ways

575
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:18,700
as for the a break operating system
operator some things to look at

to stop to threats

about prop

so that you can isolate from

that you can go back said ACLs

really good

understand you're in for inflow the

why would your printer to print server
Jordan service for that matter

595
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:43,470
need how traffic flows out but we go

00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,480
of turn on

bottom line

599
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:02,239
what us what I'm pushing really hard

600
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,949
is Tim everybody's talking about wilde
applications agree

601
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:09,690
store we really need to go

602
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:14,249
for while just work trust relationships

603
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:18,140
if something's communicating have heart
document

604
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,910
what to communicate wide doesn't

605
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:27,479
communique Hills here three layer 2

606
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:31,920
profit lands

607
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,599
to walk down the first relationship

608
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,670
step further

609
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,670
if you're yes if they're smarter

610
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,690
flexibility yes to go

611
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,799
monitor while the flow

612
00:45:48,799 --> 00:45:51,910
frost should be talkin

613
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:56,459
anything else data said trust shoe
thrown at work

614
00:45:56,459 --> 00:46:00,209
probably would make the

615
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:07,209
monitor user that's what I today

616
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:14,849
question

617
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:21,849
yeah

618
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,579
I wasn't wasn't marker

619
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:39,170
what I'm where the Cisco we're Cisco
Partner

620
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,880
I know Cisco hope

621
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,289
I know the ice

622
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:55,269
there may be some others hours

623
00:46:55,269 --> 00:47:01,680
we Francisco Cisco

624
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,940
buses

625
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:10,049
of may be smothered

626
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:17,049
the question

627
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:28,090
well people people see

628
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,280
disrupted us

629
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:39,280
a phone rings all done I was answering
the phone

630
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,500
as I was driving

631
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,950
Carolina mountains problem problem

632
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,970
with the reason

633
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:53,700
probably see really major disruptions
because it's have these things are

634
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,170
happening

635
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:58,029
not happening at the core the stuff is
not happening

636
00:47:58,029 --> 00:48:01,410
history your sprint

637
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:04,660
works securities

638
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,519
understand things

639
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,510
offers see these things happen very low

640
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,059
so when I would

641
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:21,150
go back to work that your man the
network

642
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,730
mange more work with vendors

643
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:28,230
start asking Park West about about the

644
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:35,230
accesses halfback up

645
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:42,279
ask the hard questions just no economics
are pushing them

646
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,079
quite honestly cases take

647
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:50,940
the better

648
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,049
about was trying to make their stuff
like everybody else p

649
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:59,220
green works reporting is working

650
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,950
work buildings were good

651
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,339
customers work

652
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:14,339
the clicker the red

653
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,960
system hope

654
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:25,290
good information is

655
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:32,130
questions so stud

656
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:39,130
or nor requirements roll over the
customers

657
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,990
worked free access

658
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:48,500

660
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:59,809
systems

661
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,670
what happens with us talk about
organization

662
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:35,670
like your 3 he'll support

663
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,880
fingers do the walking that business
card

664
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,510
trust

665
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:51,510
