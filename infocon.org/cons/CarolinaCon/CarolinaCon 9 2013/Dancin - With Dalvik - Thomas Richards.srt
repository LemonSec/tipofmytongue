1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,150
thanks for attending my talk second to
last talks good crowds so

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,859
it is like everyone's walking up now
from the hangover this morning

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,690
finally yeah I'm I have a clear to so is
my talk

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,070
the that's what all the who in here has
D compiled and read a BK before

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,359
awesome everyone else is going to be
really confused

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,800
so I so this talk

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,720
is the what to do after you've taken
while the navy K

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,820
and let's target need to do what we
wanted to do not with us a little

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,110
do with it so again his love about me

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,170
critical Siddle there's my twitter
handle

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,300
you want to call me sometimes I say
stuff although SEP

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,460
analyst he da sex hurts a goof I limp on
a reply were mentioned

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,140
I also about 100 in my spare time

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,140
I have 23 public ability is hoping to
see these

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,489
colonel box office or marxist whatever I
can find

16
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:03,770
before I presented different talks

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,020
Garcon Enderby and I really love tearing
apart

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,420
in so hit over gonna go over

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,030
talk about what all the is I opcode
primer

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,619
battery small and I'm gonna go and talk
about

21
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,909
couple case studies you know put in this
into use

22
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:25,180
against easy so

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,659
intro first thing well as dollar

24
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:35,500
all the town Iceland thats the technical
side of things it's also a late waste

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,530
access VM

26
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,799
that runs on the Android platform so
it's a lightweight

27
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,329
I p.m. thats use realize for a low

28
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:49,130
RAM CPU so mobile phones and its how
Android applications are run on the

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,570
phone

30
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,729
so said it using a Java VM to run the
executable

31
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:59,729
they develop their own resolution the
hell is Android app specially written in

32
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,320
Java

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,810
they can be written in C plus plus and
compiled using

34
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,299
indicate but the STK rats into clips his
job

35
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,970
so once the Java is compiled

36
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,300
it goes into Java bytecode then compiled
again

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,379
into velvet by code textiles so goes
from the doc class

38
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,970
to adopts is a picture

39
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,180
showing the difference if you were doing
just job Java

40
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,330
compiler Java bytecode run GBM when you
compile for Android

41
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,560
same thing Java source code teleplay
code then it goes into that all that by

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,800
and then an excuse at all excusable on

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,580
the mall that's also how Andrew gets the

44
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,560
the separation processes everything's in
its own little silo

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,590
everything's for as always I'll so all
the memories

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,349
contained within their so

47
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,800
person gotta do take apart the UK's Race
download something of the Play Store

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,470
what you can do with their was a
developer doing you know is it

49
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,620
play with it a lot to do with security
assessment on this

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,720
I you doing things 12 tools

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,390
them one people use a pic a tu or backs
Mali

52
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,470
and when these tools are Ron

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,220
it breaks apart the ATK if the case are
essentially is it that side

54
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,159
so opens at the BK expect a text file

55
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,650
the composite index file into the small
the files and then you're left with

56
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,110
these

57
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,980
really scary looking things if you
didn't know what it was so here's just

58
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,170
example running I'll educate all I think
I should throw that in there for anyone

59
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:41,819
who hasn't

60
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,190
before so it became too d

61
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,650
then coast near which is the UK that I
was doing

62
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,900
run through tax laws the compiling loads
resource tables

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,670
all the other fun stuff the framework
files and then it turns into

64
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,420
small so here are some other files that
are

65
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,580
in UK once its decompile

66
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,140
we start with injury manifest which is
how

67
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,580
on defines permissions and activities

68
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,239
or contact riser part the application
tells the system

69
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,470
what's in it and what expected to do

70
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,400
and then below that is this or what the
smallest as we end up getting

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,500
to be a whole bunches dot smalley files

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,870
and what we're doing so after you've
done something with a pic a change the

73
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,320
code

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,169
you wanna put it back into an BK k2 also
gives you

75
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,810
that franchise well so the difference
here is keytool

76
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,630
be for build and directory that houses

77
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,259
all small files and then the output ABK

78
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,620
so easy when it runs check the source is

79
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,750
actually compiles them small Ian which
is I think it's

80
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,460
icelandic for assembly so backs Mali is

81
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,380
this is only a small I text with a
change bills ability

82
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,060
UK now on Android after you built it
became

83
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,280
you have to sign that use in jars
otherwise and reward install

84
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,150
so every PK is side doesn't have to be a
balancer

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,419
this has to be Acer to go

86
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:27,380
all rights and Alice are talking about
I'll funds

87
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,650
as I mentioned a whole bunch smalley
files

88
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,340
when the city compiled now a scary as

89
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,330
x86 assembler I it's little more
readable

90
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,590
then Java bytecode when that's
disassembles

91
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,620
from my experience I

92
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,199
ask representation and all that opcodes
so he just looked at the text file

93
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,350
and X you know there's a direct
correlation between excised to

94
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,560
ask you that

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,699
and more sick or sponsors or Java files
to see that the top

96
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,039
so here's a hello world example from the

97
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,020
smalley cool code

98
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,870
so defines the class that the common
example

99
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,979
I'm gonna go through these kinda explain
what this is actually doing here

100
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:20,000
implement the whole so the first thing

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
variables right every code has variable
programs variables

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,780
handle everything handle so

103
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,800
in small the files will see two types
variables listed registers

104
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,970
in parameters so registers are always v0

105
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:41,530
one extra rice in up to like the 200
sometimes

106
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,169
and programs on the Schur where there
what the limit is

107
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:50,300
number on the variables defined in the
riddle Java code

108
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,180
so that's where they come from
parameters are obviously passed to a

109
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,009
function

110
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,210
so when method is defined will define it

111
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,460
parameters and then with in the code p0

112
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,759
first parameter he won second grammar

113
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,190
and both are defined to begin the net so
here's

114
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,569
the method for the whole world its
defining there's two registers

115
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,389
which are the variables in to see them
used d0

116
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,009
in

117
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,289
I'm going her

118
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,319
so it's in tights you'll see

119
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,419
on here we go back

120
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,500
there's that be right there so is
declaring what

121
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,030
type this method is

122
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,860
the for void these billion is a by

123
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,569
Exeter so when you see the function
calls and

124
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,129
functions bien invoked they also see its
type

125
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,250
at the end of it and it's good to keep
in mind if you're in messing with

126
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,849
variables

127
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,520
sure you give it what it's looking for
they're not given it you know

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,340
in was looking for a string just

129
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,340
sign variables I'll start with const

130
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,389
Inc on string there's const wide

131
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,669
you'll see the examples here is a const
30

132
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,789
0x1 so it's all index so that will
define the value

133
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,410
one to variable easier

134
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,660
if we were doing a string const string

135
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,569
the one and string after

136
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,880
in the whole world you'll see that the
one is assigned

137
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,750
world

138
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,279
calling whenever you see invoke

139
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,910
then it's calling another method the
first part of it will be whatever

140
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,149
parameters

141
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:51,029
within brackets and then the method to
call

142
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,310
we'll see invoke static for invoking

143
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,560
static method and you'll see invoke a
virtual

144
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,200
for invoking you fertile

145
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,070
here's the example its Collin so invoke
virtual

146
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,100
were passing the two parameters to be 0
and the one in the one is hello world

147
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,850
then it's Collin job I'll print stream
for life

148
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,370
and then that function takes

149
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,880
that parameter so v1

150
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,420
will be one in the 0 is being thrown
into the string so it's just callin

151
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,180
frontline

152
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:38,180
you

153
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:45,149
I have been I havent had gone that far
India

154
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,869
well i'm looking at LC both nixon a look
at the source code

155
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:52,829
like you can define a static I'll and
dollars a static function

156
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:57,129
or static variable so that's why I think
their

157
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,989
have a gun again that it into because
when I'm breaking stuff

158
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:04,129
pictured so if they miss

159
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:07,470
very important there's always conditions
you will find

160
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,639
loops there's no like for a while Jesse

161
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,509
interesting if statements to accomplish
the same thing once the code is to

162
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:15,009
compile

163
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:18,929
some examples here if EQ

164
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:23,670
the XP why and the target will jump to
see you always see the if statement

165
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,989
what's being compared and then the
target that's jumping to in the code

166
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:31,189
so if EQ is it people

167
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:34,540
Tennessee if nez if it's 90

168
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,600
QZ if it is zero and in greater than

169
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,720
less than there's it is like twenty of
them

170
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,819
when you'd the targets

171
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:48,920
are defined as conned underscoring the
number so we'll see

172
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,410
kind 0 con one I depend upon how are the
function is it how many if that means

173
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,360
it's being called

174
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,799
whoops i've seen up to like on twenty

175
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:05,029
in one in one is ample a pool

176
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,369
from source code and if you're looking
at sort column this

177
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:13,410
virtual and then it's moving that Rizal

178
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,089
30 and it's performing it with a 9-0

179
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,209
jump so if this code is a1

180
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,660
that it comes to condition 0 sets

181
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,790
it back to zero and to go to so when you
look into the small echo this is what

182
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,449
you'll see

183
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:35,509
after any ma grizzel or to name or

184
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:40,829
respect to be like in a statement
workers alright

185
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:47,829
I am going away too fast rate would go
over

186
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,589
go over the statement and then have I
move the cons 02 the other

187
00:11:53,589 --> 00:12:00,589
for example that live somewhere else in
the code

188
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,670
your yes a witty compiles in with
everything the right spots is he the

189
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,140
conditions that'll jump to

190
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:18,140
in various different spot the code so it
doesn't hit counter

191
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,500
yes

192
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,009
yes so I forget what if you get this
probably just want to show

193
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,319
the Fn and work conditions see Colin

194
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,569
con 40 or so cased

195
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:42,540
so heads headstock

196
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,139
right playing a game taken every list a
or you're going through different things

197
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,170
just sittin there

198
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,430
right so I want to find a way to remove
the ads

199
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,519
from someone like colin files after
having take-up reel stay

200
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,540
also my three-year-old possibly Angry
Birds he doesn't have the

201
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,329
motor control really not the adult I'm

202
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,970
looked at a look at this come down
though this organising who knows where

203
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,920
he's been to before he shows me

204
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,209
my phone with my thighs are showing you
know stuff

205
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,720
stall I want to buy something scary
stuff so I wanted to remove the ads

206
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,680
my own peace of mind and so I can feel
safer with my kid not like

207
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,399
now where on my phone is playing a game
who knows where these things

208
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,949
so in like to play solitaire

209
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:33,529
and after I had they were called

210
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:36,620
in between each new deal the hair right

211
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,910
go through to the you deliver

212
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,209
and I was showing add sometimes wish
just

213
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,370
like a picture times it was video video
and audio

214
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,899
have my phone vibrate something like
what the hell is this so

215
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,339
it was only calling the ad between
things how can I disable

216
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,040
everything alright

217
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,610
well I like to get phone calls and stuff
when I'm using my phone to

218
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,819
like emails so airplane mode wasn't

219
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:11,559
was an option any there want to make
sure my data was still getting through

220
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,009
to me

221
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:19,009
here is they look terrific

222
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:27,389
song calling eyes opened up the salt air
now that's gonna do a deal

223
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:34,389
I C you can see the ad come up

224
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,740
see how annoying just had my hand now I
have to skip register now of course

225
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,400
register now

226
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,400
operate disc

227
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,980
souls into the code

228
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,329
looking for anything that had the word
add that brought up

229
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,930
way too many responses her

230
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,649
kisses to let it doesn't work here so
then

231
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,339
ice are looking for display displayed

232
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:19,480
aisles looking in the main small if I'll

233
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,040
for souter so and com ability were

234
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,240
software Saltaire salter that smalley

235
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,860
I found this function displayed are

236
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,879
and then I saw that it was callin

237
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,009
another function actually this plea so
the actual

238
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,990
add code live somewhere else was just
calling it whenever there was a deal

239
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,339
well as easy comment

240
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:51,339
her now I have a video

241
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,069
what happens after I rebuilt

242
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:02,149
this wanna show you

243
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,420
I do have network connectivity up there

244
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,430
kinda hard to see the little blue do
have wireless so I did not turn off the

245
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,380
network connectivity

246
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:16,259
it bring up

247
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,480
metal handles in this one anyway so this
group Brendan deal

248
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,550
see

249
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:29,170
know at so was a line I'll do it again

250
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,189
no system with none the wiser

251
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:40,189
function everything else operated just
fine on I just turned off

252
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:51,740
I yes the newer versions Angry Birds

253
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,889
water I go over my next one reminding

254
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:01,889
so

255
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,880
I had my own sir so I this new char
signer and use my sir that I need

256
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,390
and every side yes not looking for every
doesn't look for the actual

257
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,760
like true developer sir it doesn't care
that if I was mobility where

258
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,980
Rove you like by Sir something mister is
on is it is

259
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,170
signed ATK and its assert that

260
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,020
likes to look at just otherwise again
air

261
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:39,020
do maybe push saying balancer

262
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,840
it will still ask the last year

263
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,580
so I just onto the updates if I do your
bit of history break

264
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,870
as a change is made

265
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,140
recompile it'll sign it and then

266
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,280
have to uninstall the old one and then
saw your new

267
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Axelrod log okay so the next one

268
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,020
task most abt display the add

269
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,650
at during the entire program right so
just sit there

270
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,150
at the top or you know out as the main
part the screen

271
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,570
as distant and when networks assailed

272
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,190
you get no so is there a way we can
force this behavior

273
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,570
in the program like this the program
check to see if it has network

274
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,020
connectivity or can we tell

275
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,500
have no network so here's reshot

276
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,590
the chest day with the ads on top

277
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,470
so this just sits there and rolls
through these are the the Google one so

278
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,480
they're less annoying

279
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,660
Google actually provides an ad framework

280
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,970
for developers to use in the rape case

281
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,380
and great so if I break this one's

282
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,160
now I know how to break it air almost
every other

283
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,360
UK or you know Andrea

284
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,400
that uses collapse and like I said how
to make it look is no network

285
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,120
connectivity

286
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,970
so I turn that work of and unlocked the
lock

287
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,400
see what was going on airmen and then
this error message came up

288
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,309
when I went to go to the when the app
started add request webview

289
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:24,380
world Millwall try load perfect

290
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,650
now I know what I'm looking for in the
BK after I D compiled

291
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,210
so yep I just grabbed and I found this
ring so calm Google Ads

292
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,230
and cool does office key all their stuff
so

293
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,590
the small files don't say like this is
the controllers

294
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,169
letters which is quite annoying about
the strings were

295
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,820
head and so there's the string that's
called

296
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,710
this throw into the log right after had
no never

297
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,770
so acquits doing here

298
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,790
its grabbin this object

299
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,790
right so I get getting our checks ok
it's like a veritable

300
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,900
or something somewhere and it see if
their evals it was zero

301
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,820
so that variable equal to 0 it goes down
to kanzi row

302
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,050
and says add request with you was no
water and a load

303
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,890
and goes to it error handling routine
acts like

304
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,929
I have no network connectivity so on I
can no longer

305
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:30,030
things never so

306
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,520
let's just tell it hazard so after that
I get

307
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,640
I know it's so it's definitely an
integer as do it

308
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,230
0 so I forced con Siro to be

309
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,620
it was zero at all times and then after
be compiled the

310
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,040
UK go through and now the screen real
estate is a little bit bigger and the

311
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,260
tried so back to your the question

312
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,970
Angry Birds the new Angry Birds actually
really aggressive about this

313
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,030
and I can turn off the Google ad

314
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,100
provider but you know then play its own

315
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:13,100
at just one static image in it the
entire time

316
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,370
it doesn't yeah it doesn't legal hours
just in the air

317
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,059
yes it doesn't go

318
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:32,929
doesn't go to a store anywhere and I was
looking to see how did

319
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:37,330
turn off just that you as in other ways
internal as it is

320
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,139
make the ad be 00 pixels by zero pickle
so it doesn't show

321
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:44,549
you know the code is being called that's
not

322
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:47,880
layout see there's a rodeo was actually
quite invested

323
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,909
and making sure their ads are in game
but I guess when you make your money

324
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:55,190
doing you invest the time to make it

325
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:02,190
or your it breaks

326
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,220
it breaks yet because what happens when
you remove the permission from the app

327
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,450
the writer did in code the hell that
exception rate cassette

328
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,029
think it will always have that
permission so when it goes and tries to

329
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,929
make the call

330
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:21,669
that precious doubt without the first
thing I try some editorial

331
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:28,669
get rid of that work permission but no
like that'll could do that

332
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,830
but a lot more work I don't have to and
the Middle iPhone

333
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,019
all time so next thing

334
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:40,179
pinball wizard like playing pinball but

335
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:44,690
don't like not high score how are these
people get these crazy high scores right

336
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,240
so

337
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,679
the values that are stored for the
bumpers and different

338
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,039
Target Center during the game happen to
be in

339
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,409
the code so let's up

340
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,409
so let's change that and then

341
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:05,570
show everyone overly pinball skills so
here's a typical game

342
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,539
damn only teen 100 a 6000 it's like

343
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:14,200
it's hard to say

344
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,470
can we try

345
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,470
could try turning off the lights again

346
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:32,100
you will see the highway near hit maxine
it says target practice nine

347
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,290
well there we go the cooler

348
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:42,610
so it says target practice 9 18 60

349
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,310
86 so under a six thousand points

350
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,720
after one this took a little while to
look for

351
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,690
in the code I'll each table had it

352
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,970
own like section in the

353
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:03,260
in the cold had the scores in here so I
just was looking for it and its core

354
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,410
in the graph so I found at its core
message that square message

355
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:12,410
and its taking three variables in only
one of those chains every time

356
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,800
so will too isn't but this one

357
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,230
when I converted the hex to decimal was
the value

358
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,230
so there's a value for whatever bumper
that was

359
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,940
there's another you there let's just 10
elapsed I

360
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,640
I tried putting like a lot of gaps

361
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,730
but then you hit max and way too fast
just like

362
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,300
rolls back over 20 and messes up the
scoring engineer

363
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,330
everything so I had to play with it and
not go over MaxEnt

364
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,400
try to hit the high score I in this game
was also a network-based

365
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,330
you could like put your score up on the
the leaderboard and someone found a way

366
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,210
to

367
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,730
change it not taken into with a guy like
a wide soho

368
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,010
they were getting you know II score on
there also is like number two

369
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:10,010
I go back and he was always like to be
number one crazy high scores

370
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,540
yeah I mean you could remove the call
and call

371
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,330
or change the actual metal to go back to
bed

372
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,600
police are to get into that more things
to worry about

373
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,800
more chances that it's heartbreaking
than just value

374
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,090
call different conditions the car fire
yet less is more

375
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:36,420
do less changes to the code I'll so if
you can read this is only I

376
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,730
you know I just like launch the ball to
bounce around and think

377
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,620
and 65 I the

378
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,380
so 165 654

379
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,410
million 311,000 360

380
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,500
after just the ball going around I'll

381
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,030
I that worked out pretty well in my
favor

382
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:07,030
okay honey Ghoshal what hey I look at it
also the pinball whatever

383
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,549
clearly heard

384
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:11,880
so what now

385
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,909
well hopefully you guys got will intrude
to this and

386
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:20,149
has were spent in but we can do it on
the app

387
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:23,200
Android phones and time to explore right

388
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,220
their part becas start to look at what
they're doing its

389
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,480
very readable we look at the code that's
not when you look at what it's doing

390
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:38,480
not

391
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,200
yes they are

392
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,320
you that's doable but there's two
conditions for that you need

393
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,790
a rooted device because they have to be
able at an onlooker

394
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,250
because when you're with the system
files are read only on see have to

395
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,870
modify them

396
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,950
outside this see have to

397
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,480
clockwork recovery mod create your own
update.zip

398
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,050
and patch those files have to recompile
is also signature protection along

399
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,710
so the system or fire because

400
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,920
the signature doesn't match what
everything else looking for has not

401
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,020
signed Bible

402
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,050
there is ways to do certain protection
is a bitter tax so that's

403
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,290
with the Gateway more complicated to
operate the system

404
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:37,290
then just modified K

405
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,430
no

406
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:51,430
there's there's different were so what
are you trying to protect

407
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,160
so someone Pollensa you developer

408
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:06,160
put the BK up in the store to yeah

409
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,870
its when you with this is that the
compiler can

410
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,640
on you just look for ways to mitigate
that risk so

411
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,450
so someone takes your ABK and in
technology into it

412
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,650
they're most likely not going to put it
back on the store

413
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,770
so ends up going into the third party
pirate stores are out there another huge

414
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:33,770
that within our lives third resource
there's no way

415
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:48,200
rate

416
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,740
a bouncer is running to malware attacks
I think it's also a look for

417
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,510
like to cook ones to try and do with
that flag because it sees

418
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:03,510
that somewhere else very similar

419
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:22,979
from the Play Store or on the phone all

420
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:26,669
yes when yes when thou the consoles each
app is going it alone

421
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:30,940
user pretty much on the phone at how to
control the permissions so one app can't

422
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,039
just directly access

423
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:37,479
all developers that but one Afghan to
directly access another app state

424
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:44,479
that however to the Gazette hazard user
ID

425
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,350
it'll turn alternate start to see

426
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,600
it'll still compile into attacks for so
they re

427
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,600
miles away

428
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:22,730
a return

429
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:29,730
to return something here reporting code
here

430
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,260
I'll just like it'll be like return
string

431
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,450
a return void this a virtual ten studio

432
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,950
is awesome it is a green environment for
doing everything

433
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,950
the it has 80k to endorse either within
built into it

434
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,090
see just like pulling the ATK

435
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,760
in it compiles it makes everything

436
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,760
as a backup recompiling pushed back to
your phone with free you have everything

437
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,450
the Ritter

438
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,170
so there's a return void

439
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:29,170
as a result the functions word you
always hear eternity N

440
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:37,040
later

441
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:49,440
sectors it is returned object so
sometimes they were able to be

442
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,320
objects history or in something

443
00:31:53,320 --> 00:32:00,320
to see it as return object there

444
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,320
yeah and refund

445
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:13,320
or on the service road

446
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,789
that's all done on the Android system
dollar runs on top

447
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:23,000
like the dollar be an Android X

448
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,769
at all like then so with those
communicate back to the curls so your

449
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:28,299
Apple

450
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:33,399
never talk to the curl your app talked
at all equipment to get access to like

451
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:40,399
the network are SD card

452
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:51,280
no when you do an ADB push it doesn't
prompt you for anything

453
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:58,280
just installs on yes I'll insulation
right on that side

454
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:10,450
if you have root access then you can
look at rates

455
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:19,450
certain have to be trusted has to be

456
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,280
a sir

457
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,720
so what else do in arm some other work

458
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,770
looking at some other if the case for
work I

459
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,650
was pulled them up and i the company's
and even try

460
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:36,140
to do with Sir you know they just had
like the company name as i cn

461
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,390
everything else like a great because
it's Phil

462
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,620
out it look like a real sir it does have
your company name

463
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,100
in the CNS and other ones like look real

464
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,100
you know so it interesting side to this
new look at the

465
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,670
the circus do that it in the GTK+

466
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,230
I think how to read jar apartments or
