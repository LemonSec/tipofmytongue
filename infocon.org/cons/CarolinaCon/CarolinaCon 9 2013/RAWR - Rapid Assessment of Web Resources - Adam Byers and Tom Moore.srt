00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,140
yes

2
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,779
okay so here talking about the rapid
assessment resources

3
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:32,779
are

4
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,500
struck with a little introduction talk
about whether what's

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,309
Ross time tools

6
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:50,899
targeting lives or top

7
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,909
on about what we're doing with the data
plan

8
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:00,189
future and then we're gonna take it for
a spin is right here

9
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:03,210
chiggers recognize the car

10
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,159

if

30
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,480
really sort

31
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:52,069
the P

32
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:59,069
eased

33
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,019
aboard

34
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,889
their

35
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:22,889
up on your

their

38
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,660
cool

39
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,660
up

40
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,570
bed

41
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,280
or

42
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,280
there

43
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:52,050
week

44
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,250
we

45
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:34,250
would

46
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:13,470
with

47
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:26,410
room

48
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,710
art

49
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:30,710
week

50
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,500
this one yeah that's actually

51
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,050
okay middle right so for

52
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,370
was three or four weeks this web says

53
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,570
like real which

54
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:13,280
discovery to the analysis

55
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,980
runnin you know your skin Iran this

56
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,500
all these different information you work
%uh

57
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,370
shop information wrapping

58
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,550
home

59
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,080
so there's a lot of preparation

60
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,080
all I think about two or three weeks
seriously so

61
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,310
and thats cash automation

62
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,410
coding good

63
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,860
but so

64
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,300
he can't there's this niche and I think
that's important because

65
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,340
maybe coder on the blue team

66
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,400
we worked or organization resource for
project

67
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,730
think there's a real colors plugged

68
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,730
people that because I don't

69
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,810
and

70
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,250
on the other side if you're right free
to jump in

71
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,240
store scripting some ideas

72
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,740
things this just

73
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,940
just jump do worry what anybody says
about

74
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,610
guys like myself loved

75
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,790
if you're trying to improve the code try
to make X

76
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,390
workers share expertise

77
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,590
take some training home

78
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,860
twitter feed like every other day
security to

79
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,730
think as anybody taken

80
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,390
that's that's good

81
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,110
class do it and those guys like me

82
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,530
to take stuff

83
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,120
ok think that real were

84
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,610
just to get the tools rating

85
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,420
still kinda learn the ropes and stuff
obscene

86
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:38,420
me briefers

87
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,440
we in

88
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,780
and

89
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,290
you little through in

90
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,430
example

91
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:04,430
might learned by

92
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,740
house task course guys like

93
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:19,260
aspiring colors would say pick it up

94
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,260
do it so

95
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,220
we'll take a look at rar works

96
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,880
this is basically based on switches

97
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,960
restore log side

98
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,640
so the default be logged scored a time

99
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,640
or whatever directory if you want to

100
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,330
compresses taxi specified

101
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,750
director

102
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,410
we get to this camp or once we determine
where

103
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,850
want that to be put scan attack X and
this is

104
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,470
the cool thing I like

105
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,660
is if you've done a previous there's a
couple prereq

106
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,110
record prerequisites to this if you've
done a scan already

107
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,330
like your you do an internal assessment
which

108
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,140
run done that you can feed Rex

109
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,240
files take cell

110
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,990
web services on you

111
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,760
when if Europe

112
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,890
you up

113
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,300
and

114
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,340
whipple

115
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,180
information burdening hope

116
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,280
so

117
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,310
tak hai you can do map

118
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:09,310
basically

119
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:17,619
Creek

120
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,330
so

121
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,790
yep

122
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,670
so okay so attack in

123
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:42,250
range give it support the point that is
to get to the exit

124
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,390
right seen it in from a previous can
having

125
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,529
in

126
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,360
ok

127
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,570
so at this point generation one is

128
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,890
much information each these interfaces

129
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,080
screenshots years

130
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,330
anything about that response word SSL
certs

131
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,770
think useful more information

132
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:19,820
against so much gonna give you

133
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,860
a better idea what host or what

134
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,440
type that in with than

135
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,440
former you see it out there

136
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,790
we're looking at were supplementing

137
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,899
numeration resolving

138
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,050
I P the country getting the country
origin

139
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,600
def passed us yes trying to compile

140
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,649
user

141
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:02,410
but

142
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,600
whipple information like login not

143
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,800
from from every what it is

144
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,220
services so

145
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,209
got I'd credentials

146
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:23,570
and there's about six thousand

147
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,980
record as much as we could

148
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,050
for tech in there if it's gonna be
something

149
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,350
showed directors information now

150
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,110
attack tech

151
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,949
be sprinkle because we're using really

152
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,220
share IP address

153
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,500
here help tell you

154
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,250
domain names feature

155
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,110
feature being

156
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,600
I P colon looking while

157
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,660
every domain make

158
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,970
still ok acres anything

159
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,829
at like this

160
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,919
really funny sometimes seeing

161
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,059
who sir so

162
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:32,059
get the help and what you need to put
your kill

163
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:41,360
ribbon

164
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,370
good so

165
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,760
yeah moment

166
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,720
so you go you're in maps right just a
note

167
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,770
for the XML plan with the

168
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:03,400
the XSL from

169
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,020
anyway

170
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:16,020
fix a reference for that cop excess gene
mapping

171
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,750
all against us we've also got a CSP
screen

172
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,790
call

173
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,610
its customized

174
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:32,000
switch around columns taken away the way
they did

175
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,120
course things rejectionist

176
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,059

you can there

389
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,700
you can't make

beautiful login right

394
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:41,080
attack print

395
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:47,280
for a year recognized

396
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,940
screen this gets fun

397
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:57,330
people this is on the Internet

398
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,820
and

399
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:06,780
an so much all your

400
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,750
this one guarantee

401
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:16,750
in I'm not doing

402
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:23,750
this is an offline followed

403
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,690
so anybody get the movie reference

404
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:36,490
were talking about job description

405
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:43,490
he's like

406
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:52,530
given they were looking for

407
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,339
women sir

408
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:06,280
for yes they don't like I'm telling you
don't like

409
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,780
they hide everything and yes

410
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:18,780
all the information

411
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:26,180
image only

412
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:33,180
images

413
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:56,440
actually were

414
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:03,440
this rain all much having

415
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:11,619
the main you click

416
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:32,730
like that

417
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,710
are useful one indirectly well

418
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,220
into the report so

419
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:48,220
you have a way to be able to you say
quick with

420
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,260
rule clean

421
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:02,260
right you see the mouseover

422
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,180
open I for information

423
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,869
and then you've got both mine is

424
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:15,559
actually will yourself and I so

425
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:22,559
with somebody to

426
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,760
to

427
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:42,710
through you can the they're gonna come
up

428
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:49,260
in in basically for

429
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,290
as a hold being

430
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,420
names work

431
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,900
all that well I P

432
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,569
is wild Paul

433
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:09,619
everything so

434
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:13,170
a lot he would not have gotten just

435
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:18,900
banning that segment because there are
multiple side

436
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:25,900
and being him

437
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:36,170
like things no it

438
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:43,170
so

439
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,040
basically very

440
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,760
enumerate the network

441
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,670
in a way hopefully pretty easy to use

442
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,859
we we

443
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:05,880
here we

444
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,069
last year Carolina call on about needed

445
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:15,079
world workers

446
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,299
we talked about we've been brainstorming
we've been

447
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,410
ride there are a lot of awesome there

448
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,559
well this world

449
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:32,559
one as long as you have enough memory

450
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:39,690
render the nicer

451
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:47,200
it is not checked them because mmm the
only

452
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,039
map

453
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:56,499
trying to export

454
00:45:56,499 --> 00:46:00,700
this enables your

455
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,989
enumeration mapping phase though it's
not really gonna go

456
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:07,150
group

457
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,960
we wanted to be very quiet

458
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,759
and really really didn't want it to be
quiet I make things

459
00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:20,309
pain but I like the quiet

460
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:24,079
I like the of being

461
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,499
the all these requests are

462
00:46:27,499 --> 00:46:31,039
Valatie your place the in

463
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,349
the only thing anyone ideas answer in
this room

464
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:41,349
sewed number

465
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,619
requests from to Valatie

466
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:48,210
sources which is not very common because

467
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:55,210
traffic is something we like a lot

468
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:02,069
that okay

469
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:09,069
you work for being making one-third

470
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:13,109
being one sir

471
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:18,289
the rest in a ride you're just doing

472
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:22,699
and yes that would be internal I don't
think

473
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:27,430
much breaks extra yeah new

474
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,119
when you start new rate-limiting on

475
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:38,119
on people being search you're gonna have
a whole nother rolled

476
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,930
well in that case in their arse we're
trying to put together

477
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,930
were after after numeration but

478
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,240
but your best bet would be like that
Boyd

479
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:05,240
you know record for

480
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:18,550
something maybe

481
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:52,900
the most useful going through this

482
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,499
building the whose armored

483
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:03,619

to

486
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,670

we're looking other army

489
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,349
other based on the floor the

490
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:31,229
out within this interface

491
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:36,950
