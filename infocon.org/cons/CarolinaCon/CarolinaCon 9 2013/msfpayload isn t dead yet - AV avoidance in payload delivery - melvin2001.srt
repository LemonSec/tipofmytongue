actually

19
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:09,180
X signatures

20
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:22,350
different actually decide

21
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:47,109
going

22
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:25,860
years

23
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,890
this is what we r initially

24
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,890
world

25
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,760
you year

26
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,880
call

27
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,980
operating principle

28
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,890
work all

29
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,160
work

30
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,680
agree

31
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,030
faster

32
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:40,030
which is great rivers

33
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,190
work

34
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:13,190
program step

35
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,010
we'll so

36
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,180
good

37
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,180
everyone here should

38
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,370
I want your opinion

39
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,330
stories jury

40
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,030
boards

41
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,080
we're having

42
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,080
with during the cuddling

43
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,960
we talked about inside

44
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,560
for short

45
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:42,560
try some

46
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,000
years

47
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,199
word

48
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,199
directly

49
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,850
characters little

50
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:22,020
protocol

51
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:29,020
operation third

52
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:34,969
we

53
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:41,969
way they're actually change week

54
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:09,300
same which

55
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:39,430
actually

56
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,750
there's actually some

57
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:54,750
endeavors actually so

58
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:07,270
our first are

59
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:14,270
generate

60
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:23,620
instructions heuristics actually

61
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,330
but this was our first

62
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,580
where we have something

63
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:07,580
word source

64
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:17,210
your

65
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,570
start using

66
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:20,460
spring we're actually

67
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,820
were using your

68
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,780
you

69
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:58,780
construction sorry I

70
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:09,339
actually short

71
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:31,100
we started random crap

72
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,820
pushing I'd

73
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:43,310
then instruction

74
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:50,310
after

75
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,610
director

76
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,030
recompile in

77
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,850
your modified

78
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:15,850
which all

79
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:25,040
we actually

80
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,580
I'd

81
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:38,580
actually

82
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:46,810
putting

83
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:56,089
things together interesting were

84
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:12,000
and injecting we actually

85
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
under generation success was actually
and

86
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:32,709
actually file

87
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,500
their for file

88
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:51,140
one using all very

89
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:58,140
and

90
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,270
one very

91
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,660
ghostwriting we're actually

92
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,090
tactic we did one

93
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:23,090
success

94
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,540
here

95
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:43,990
the action different one

96
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:50,990
actually happen

97
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:11,699
actually the

98
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,709
you'll see happen

99
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,380
happens

100
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,380
actually

101
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,620
years better

102
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:44,620
mister

103
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,990
actually work

104
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:56,990
issue interesting we can actually

105
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:04,420
execution mister first

106
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,100
yes

107
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:16,100
actually

108
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,060
using just the plain

109
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,940
sold

110
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,080
actually

111
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,960
working

112
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,960
hope

113
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:54,300
with we started thinking

114
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:03,620
or

115
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,940
later if

116
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,650
scripting actually

117
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:36,070
hide me

118
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:42,800
execute goes

119
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,320
show generate act

120
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,750
directly

121
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:57,750
actually inexcusable script group

122
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,490
and then webster

123
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,500
webster would

124
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,500
file

125
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,480
art

126
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:46,540
wishes so

127
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:06,260
actually generate location

128
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,150
and

129
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:24,150
sec the second part

130
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,070
word you know

131
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,450
director name location

132
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:44,450
where you're gonna host during after

133
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,130
have your same

134
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,710
custom

135
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,990
attack different just

136
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:07,990
and actually sir

137
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,899
now and

138
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:18,549
think red

139
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:25,440
remote and

140
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,440
we actually tactics things

141
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:41,909
success

142
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:48,909
you'd

143
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:05,869
actually a programmer

144
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:20,080
ways never

145
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:40,210
next

146
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:50,820
are bud

147
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:38,070
first

148
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,190
experiments with we're using winter

149
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,750
standard

150
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:03,750
just butter

151
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:15,269
while we were

152
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,960
for

153
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,960
one that was

154
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:39,500
or head this

155
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:43,429
really well

156
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:50,429
should be

157
00:25:53,609 --> 00:26:00,609
we ended up with using

158
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:12,279
yes

159
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,899
actually

160
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:33,190
generate your

161
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:39,149
side actually after

162
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:46,149
is actually yeah

163
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,839
alerted yeah

164
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,950
between

165
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:10,950
we haven't yeah

166
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:20,570
week

167
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:28,769
and alerts between

168
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:38,549
which mister and that

169
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:52,639
host an hour

170
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:59,639
actually your ex

171
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,909
actual execute the rest in

172
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:14,489
area people

173
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:19,379
with so

174
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:24,429
X running

175
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:31,429
right now your news

176
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:38,679
right now and

177
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,679
people ginger work

178
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,679
now from

179
00:28:53,249 --> 00:29:00,249
actually

180
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:23,509
tried

181
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:29,919
tried

182
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,919
which later generating

183
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:06,999
rather

184
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,400
showed

185
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:40,400
and

186
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:48,170
wide

187
