1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,759
hi and welcome to the session

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,599
in this session we are going to take a

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,800
dive into

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,680
discussing hacking movements we're going

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,720
to look at

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
some methods and some tips some

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,320
strategies that we have discovered doing

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
penetration testing and social

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,599
engineering engagements

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
to help you create social engineering

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,239
scenarios that actually work

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,600
so who am i i am william price

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,640
i help organizations identify

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,719
cybersecurity weaknesses resolve them

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,879
and reduce the risk of breaches

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,000
at cyberx and over the years

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,680
i've conducted a lot of penetration

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,120
tests

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,719
and what i want to focus on today

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,079
is social engineering engagements and

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,559
some of the methods we've developed for

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,438
going after individuals to get them to

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,200
take the action that we want social

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
engineering them

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,720
and so i think that's a good starting

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
point is so what exactly

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,400
is social engineering and

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,040
the commonly agreed definition is social

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,320
engineering

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
is any act that convinces someone to

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,360
take an

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
action that may or may not be in their

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,680
best interest

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
and this action that they take um is

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,799
going to depend on the type of social

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
engineering engineering engagement or

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,840
uh scenario that you are in if this is

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,439
physical social engineering trying to

39
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,600
physically access a facility

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,280
um this act that they take might be

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
allowing me to enter the building it

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,640
might be opening the door for someone

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,399
who should not be in the building

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
if this is email social engineering or

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
phishing

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
it might be getting them to click on a

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
link it might be getting them to provide

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,960
me their credentials

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,799
or it might be i call them up on the

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,840
phone

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,600
i want to find out a particular piece of

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
information i want to know what type of

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,959
antivirus they're using

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,000
and i'll create a scenario where in

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
they will tell me that the kind of

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
antivirus they're using without having

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,560
their suspicions around

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,640
they have taken an action that is not in

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,239
their best interest it is not in that

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,040
company

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,800
or that individual's best interest for

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
me as an attacker to know what kind of

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,119
antibiotics they have

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
why social engineering why

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
is that an attack myth that we should be

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,440
worried about

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,680
as defenders and why is it something we

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,879
should be utilizing

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,720
as the offensive security defensive side

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,959
of thing

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
and why does it even work and that's

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
what i want to talk about on this slide

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,519
why is social engineering so effective

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,959
these states

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,360
and if you look at the left we have a

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
traditional

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,920
network environment um we have computers

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
if we had some cloud instances

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
we had a vpn that connected us up to our

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,680
cloud instances

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,040
and we from the user's perspective it

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,680
still

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,480
appeared to be inside the network now on

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,519
the right we look at

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,040
what our i.t

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
environment has morphed into in the last

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,080
decade

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
or more and if you think about

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,239
your job or the company you work for and

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,239
the applications that are in use

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,599
it's not as common for every server to

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,400
be housed

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
at a data center inside the company in

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
some kind of network closet

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
server closet server room whatever it is

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
much more common now that we are using

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,920
applications um platform as a service

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,799
applications as a service cloud we're

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,439
using dropbox office 365

100
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,120
share file by citrix sharepoint

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,560
google drive and if you think about

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
how do you get to each of these

103
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,480
applications now you go to a portal and

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
you log in

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
you might be asked for some kind of

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
verification two-factor authentication

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,238
but we go and we log in and

108
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,199
this logging in in my opinion has

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,199
conditioned our users so that it's

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,040
normal to just go and log in

111
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,280
and that sort of lowers their

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
awareness of official consent that could

113
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
could happen

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
so according to this statistic um in

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
2017 this research that was done

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,720
70 of workers feel that they are

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
overworked at their jobs

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
um they feel like they don't have enough

119
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,080
time in the day

120
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,600
they can't keep up with everything they

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
need to do they're rushing

122
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
trying to get their job done trying to

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
get everything done they need to so they

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,639
can get out the door by five by four by

125
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,479
three whenever time they get off

126
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,759
they don't want to have to take work on

127
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,000
they're trying to hurry hurry hurry

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
and hurry and rush

129
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,720
quote dulls your senses um it dulls

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,960
and causes you to rush through things

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,000
and ignore

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
flags um that if you were

133
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,919
taking the time to be cognizant of what

134
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,360
you're doing

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
the they are rushing through these and

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
ignoring them and that as an attacker is

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
a great thing for me

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,080
and again this is 2017. think about

139
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
2020.

140
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,039
i've been sure to say 95 percent of

141
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,199
workers are feeling overworked or

142
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,840
stressed out

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360
they're working at home they've got

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,039
children running around at the same time

145
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,720
children on laptops or

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
ipads or whatever learning everyone's at

147
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,800
home

148
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
and it adds the stress it adds to the

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,560
overwork and we saw

150
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
in 2020 the social social engineering

151
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,039
engagements that we conducted

152
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,600
um our success rate was much much higher

153
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,840
than it had been in past years and we

154
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
believe that that is a part of the

155
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
reason

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
another factor that contributes to the

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,039
effectiveness and the success rate

158
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,520
of social engineering is as humans

159
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
we have an innate tendency to want to

160
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
trust

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,400
the people around us we want to trust

162
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
our family we want to trust our

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
relatives our friends we want to trust

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
people we want to talk to people

165
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
we want to relate to people and we want

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,600
to be helpful we want to help people um

167
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,360
we've been taught to have good manners

168
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,039
as children all the way

169
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,759
growing up um talk to have good manners

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
how to be kind

171
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
and it's been ingrained into us to help

172
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,840
people to trust people

173
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,919
according to valley mail in

174
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,599
june of 2019 there were three

175
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
billion fake emails being sent a day now

176
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,080
if you think about the numbers of

177
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
workers that there are

178
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,759
the number of emails you receive in a

179
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,639
day

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,720
three billion fake emails that's a lot

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
of fake emails

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,560
that's three seven so the people in the

183
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
world are receiving one

184
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,759
fake email a day um

185
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
that's every other day you are receiving

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,039
a fake email

187
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
that fake email could be spam it could

188
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
be a scam some kind of fishing

189
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,840
um but that is something to be aware of

190
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,560
and again on the topic why social

191
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,319
engineering is important to focus on why

192
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,520
it's important to test social

193
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
engineering to conduct social

194
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
engineering engagements

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,560
to test your employees to train your

196
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
employees

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
or as an attacker to conduct social

198
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
engineering attacks to include them in

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
the services that are offered by your

200
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,479
company

201
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,800
three percent of malware and this is

202
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,840
according to know before

203
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
three percent of malware seeks to

204
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,800
exploit a strictly technical flaw

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
ninety-seven percent of malware targets

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,759
a user in some capacity in some way

207
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,120
um in that attack life cycle if this is

208
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
a ransomware

209
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
they will most of the time start with

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the fish get credentials so now that

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,599
they have final vulnerability they can

212
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,199
send a payload they have credentials

213
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,479
that they can move

214
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,000
laterally inside the organization

215
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
so let's look at some cases in which

216
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,639
social engineering has caused data

217
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,840
breaches in organizations

218
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,640
you guys remember in the prior to the

219
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
2016 election there was the incident

220
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,839
with john podesta at the dnc

221
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,720
um he received a phishing email

222
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,279
and if you look at the email of course

223
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,040
the format is bad there should be

224
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
lots of red flags that should have gone

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
off there's a bitly address

226
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,920
um that you can see towards the bottom

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,839
with a change password

228
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,440
um lots of red flags um the emo the

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
domain that this is coming from is

230
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,399
google email

231
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,519
and the story is that he sent us to i t

232
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,040
they meant to say this is illegitimate

233
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,440
and they

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,839
actually said it's legitimate either way

235
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,800
this should have been a clear

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,160
red flag um diapers we see europe coming

237
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,760
from ukraine and we all know the story

238
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
what happened i got into his email

239
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,880
that was a pretty important breach all

240
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,519
caused by fishing

241
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,760
um if you remember around 2014 the sony

242
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,560
hack

243
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
sony was putting out a movie the north

244
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
koreans didn't like

245
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,880
on the north koreans retaliated they

246
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,680
fished

247
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,399
so many people at sony to get vpn

248
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,279
credentials

249
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,680
then they were connected to the network

250
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,519
they deployed a wiper malware that

251
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
completely wiped their systems

252
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,120
and did a lot a lot of damage to sony

253
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,399
and it all started with fishing

254
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,519
i'm close to home where i am um not far

255
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,880
away in greenville

256
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,079
south carolina there was a cyber attack

257
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,519
at the water facility

258
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
and this started by an employee who

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
clicked a phishing email

260
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,279
and we all know there's a lot of talk

261
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:15,839
about

262
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,480
critical infrastructure if you're

263
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
familiar with the 16 critical industries

264
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,600
healthcare financial banking

265
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,519
oil gas all of those this is a huge

266
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,959
level of risk

267
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,160
especially in these types of

268
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
environments where we have

269
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,040
networks that are connected an employee

270
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,480
on the corporate side can get fish and

271
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
that can connect over into robots and

272
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,440
manufacturing and it can be a really big

273
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,760
mess

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,200
and on that note the dhs

275
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
was i'm discussing a ransomware incident

276
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
that hit the us gas pipeline operator a

277
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,880
couple years ago

278
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,680
and operations were halted for two days

279
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
at that gas

280
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,839
compression company and think about the

281
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,079
down the chain effects this has

282
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,839
they're unable to compress gas it's

283
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,000
unable to go to the distributors which

284
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,839
is unable to go to the

285
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,360
end users so now individuals are running

286
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,079
out of gas

287
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,200
they might not be able to heat their

288
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,399
homes this can get to be a really big

289
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:16,959
mess

290
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,040
and it starts with a simple attack like

291
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
fishing

292
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,600
okay so moving on to the social

293
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
engineering life cycle

294
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,160
and this is the typical process we

295
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,880
follow

296
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
um when we are conducting a social

297
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,399
engineering engagement

298
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
it begins with information gathering i

299
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,760
want to know as

300
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,959
much about an individual as i can

301
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,000
i want to know their name where they

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
live what they like the tv shows they

303
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,560
like

304
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,760
the music they like to listen to their

305
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
hobbies the things they like to do

306
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,800
on weekends what they like to do after

307
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,399
work to restaurants they like to go to

308
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,399
their pet's name their children's name

309
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
everyone in their family's birthdays

310
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
their favorite color

311
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,279
if i can get a youtube video of the

312
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,120
person i know what they talk like the

313
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
words they use their intonations

314
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
i want to know as much about this

315
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,200
individual as i possibly can

316
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,399
and the company i'm going after

317
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,760
then and depending on the scenario

318
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,839
next step is building a relationship and

319
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,160
rapport with the individual

320
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
and again this depends on the attack

321
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,680
scenario

322
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
if you're fishing how much time you have

323
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
this is a

324
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
prolonged engagement um

325
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,720
get to know this individual get to like

326
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,880
them um

327
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,519
if this is a physical pendant with a

328
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
decent amount of time maybe i'll

329
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
bump into them at a restaurant while

330
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
they're out for lunch

331
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,959
and they'll like me and then start a

332
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,480
conversation and now i know

333
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,279
from my information gathering i know a

334
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,720
certain

335
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,519
non-profit that they support and i

336
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,959
support that non-profit

337
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,440
and we become friends and then i can

338
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,279
build my relationship and my rapport

339
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,480
with that individual from there

340
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,519
then we move on to exploitation and

341
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,800
exploitation is where i

342
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
craft a scenario to social engineering

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,839
here

344
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,839
social engineer them remember social

345
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,680
engineering is to get them to take an

346
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,320
action

347
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,639
that is not in their best interest maybe

348
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,200
this individual that i have met at the

349
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
burger shop two blocks away from the

350
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,480
office

351
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,360
location where they work maybe i get

352
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,160
into a conversation with them and i

353
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
i want to know how many cameras are in

354
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,279
the lobby maybe i

355
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,720
throw in something like yeah i heard you

356
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
guys places like fort knox there's 20

357
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,720
cameras just in the lobby

358
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
and they say no that's not true there's

359
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
only three cameras in the lobby

360
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
and boom i have exported them and in

361
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,560
this case execute it

362
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
to get that information and that's the

363
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,839
social engineering life cycle that we

364
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,160
follow

365
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,680
so when it comes to social engineering

366
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
let's talk about some tips for actually

367
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,920
accomplishing the goal

368
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,560
the mission to attain that piece of

369
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,279
information

370
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
you're looking for to get them to take

371
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,920
that action to clip

372
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
to log in bypass multi-factor

373
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,199
authentication we've done that in

374
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,639
engagements

375
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
how do you accomplish that goal

376
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,480
and so the thing to understand as you

377
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,040
craft social engineering attacks

378
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,600
is people respond basically one of two

379
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,480
ways they either respond logically

380
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,959
they think about it and they respond or

381
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
they respond out of emotion

382
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
i'm excited i'm angry i'm upset

383
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,480
i'm sad i'm intimidated and i

384
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,639
skip logic and i respond based on an

385
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,680
emotion

386
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,160
and as a social engineering that is

387
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
where you can get individuals to do what

388
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,199
you want

389
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,399
that is where you can get them to give

390
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,480
you information click on a link

391
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,240
take an action log into a fake portal

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,440
if you can get them to bypass logic

393
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
and respond based on emotion

394
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,519
so what are some of the emotions fear

395
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,240
i'm afraid

396
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,399
of something that might happen to me or

397
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,160
i'm afraid of

398
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,600
a circumstance i'm afraid

399
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
of authority i'm afraid to lose my job

400
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,199
if i don't do what i've been asked to do

401
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,800
i'm afraid money is being stolen from my

402
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,399
bank account whatever the scenario

403
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,920
happens to be

404
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,040
excitement i'm happy um

405
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
i'm gonna get something someone's giving

406
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,880
me something i'm getting a promotion i'm

407
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,959
getting money added to my 401k

408
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,440
i'm gonna get a free iphone excitement

409
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,560
authority someone hire up to the company

410
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
is telling me to do something i have to

411
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,120
obey

412
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,639
they are authority depending on the um

413
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,600
scope and what is allowed or not allowed

414
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,320
maybe

415
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
um you are some kind of governmental

416
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
organization

417
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,680
environmental organization that's going

418
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,440
to do an inspection authority

419
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,680
sympathy um i mentioned earlier about

420
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,560
the

421
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,000
uh um if you find someone that

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
supports say a non-profit or a certain

423
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
foundation

424
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,519
or you find they are sympathetic to a

425
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,880
certain cause

426
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,639
that is something that can be used

427
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,000
against

428
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,360
people maybe they feel a certain way

429
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,639
about

430
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,880
politics if that's in scope for the

431
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,720
engagement a lot of times politics is

432
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,320
out of scope

433
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,920
maybe they are sympathetic for something

434
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,240
that has happened to someone in the news

435
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
and they are talking about it on social

436
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,279
media that might be a perfect way to

437
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,800
come in with a social engineering

438
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,279
scenario

439
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,560
ego stroking making someone feel good

440
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,920
we've done use this on multiple

441
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,759
organizations making someone feel

442
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
important um there was

443
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
penetration tests we did for a pretty

444
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680
large financial company

445
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,199
now they work with a lot of banks a lot

446
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
of back-end transactions

447
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
um fishing we were doing a social

448
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,039
engineering gamut to fish their

449
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,400
employees

450
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,799
and we came up with a scenario this

451
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,720
organization had recently been

452
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,079
recognized by a certain

453
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,280
board pre-reputable board in their field

454
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,919
the financial space they've been

455
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,799
recognized

456
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,839
as a leading leading in the industry

457
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,880
so we created a scenario where we faked

458
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
like

459
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
we were from a certain large media

460
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,799
corporation

461
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,080
newspaper and we had heard about

462
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
their recognition their award we went to

463
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,559
the marketing

464
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,039
the head of marketing the vice president

465
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,880
over the marketing department

466
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,400
and we wanted to ask them questions

467
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
um about or do an interview and we sent

468
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
over the questions and

469
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,480
it was shared quote via office 365

470
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,440
because we know that's what they were

471
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,160
using

472
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
and it took them to a fake portal where

473
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
they logged in and we got their

474
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,080
credentials

475
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
and we were able to even bypass

476
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
multi-factor authentication

477
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,240
this person felt important and they

478
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,039
wanted to take these actions because it

479
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,480
made them feel important

480
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
at their company

481
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,640
so we talked about building rapport with

482
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
an individual

483
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
and this is something i'll come back to

484
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,200
a little later

485
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
when i'm conducting a social engineering

486
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,559
engagement

487
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,720
there are times when i have to write off

488
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
the bats inefficient email

489
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,840
and ask for credentials but i typically

490
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,640
don't

491
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,360
i typically build a rapport with an

492
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,440
individual so

493
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
i'm going to build a conversation into

494
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,799
my ask

495
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,600
i try to never especially if i'm doing

496
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,440
if this is part of a penetration test

497
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,480
where i have one shot to get this um

498
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,000
or red team engagement something of that

499
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,799
nature and we're not trying to gauge the

500
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,160
different levels of complexity that

501
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,679
someone falls for

502
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
i'm going to be very very careful to

503
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,919
never come up with my ask as

504
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,520
in my first email my first communication

505
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,280
i'm going to build into that um

506
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,799
so i'm

507
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,840
i call up a company i fake like we are x

508
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,640
company

509
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,559
it's the end of the year we're trying to

510
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,000
get rid of five hundred thousand dollars

511
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,600
by the end of the year for tax purposes

512
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
we've been buying a certain product you

513
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,160
sell for a long time

514
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
let's see what we can work out i'm

515
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,360
talking to the sales department

516
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
sales and marketing people are always

517
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,600
easy targets keep that in mind

518
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,039
because their job is to interact with

519
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,640
people the same goes for hr

520
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,200
their job is to open resumes all day and

521
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
if you can

522
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
um do this right you can make take

523
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,559
advantage of that

524
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,640
so back to the sales i'm going to talk

525
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,960
to them build up a conversation on the

526
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
phone we're going to have some email

527
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
back and forth

528
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,799
and then at some point where it's

529
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,520
appropriate i'm going to slip in my ask

530
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
maybe that's to ask them to download a

531
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,799
certain pdf

532
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,120
that shows the schematics of some

533
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,799
product we're working on

534
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,960
or i'm going to share a certain file

535
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,640
with them and for some reason my email

536
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,520
is blocking it

537
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,039
i can't figure this out i'm not tech

538
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,640
savvy so i'm just going to put on one

539
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
drive and share with you and it takes

540
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
them to a fake login portal

541
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
i'm going to throw that in at some point

542
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,440
after i've already built rapport with

543
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,240
this individual

544
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
and they they're not suspicious of me in

545
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,559
the least bit

546
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,000
and i'm also always going to close the

547
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,360
loop and we'll get back to that

548
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,000
in a little bit

549
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
one thing that can be very very useful

550
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
for crafting social engineering attacks

551
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,320
is the principle of reciprocation and if

552
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,679
you think about it

553
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,159
you've been taught since the day you

554
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,120
were

555
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,760
little your parents taught you someone

556
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,720
does something for you

557
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
good manners what do you do you say

558
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
thank you someone holds the door you say

559
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
thank you someone does something for you

560
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
you thank them you help them and

561
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,720
that is a subconscious

562
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,080
um tendency that most of us have someone

563
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
does something good for me i want to do

564
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,960
something good for back

565
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,000
they smile at me i want to smile back

566
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,440
and as an attacker i can make a lot of

567
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
use of that

568
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,080
um i do something for you you want to

569
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,039
help me

570
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,400
i hold the door open for you

571
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,159
so you want to hold the next door open

572
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,840
for me and that lets me right through

573
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,640
security

574
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
and there's many ways that you can take

575
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,440
advantage of this

576
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,200
all right so let's talk about actually

577
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
conducting the social engineering attack

578
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,720
and some actual

579
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,320
hands-on practical things you can do

580
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,799
now i talked about building rapport with

581
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,679
the people

582
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,200
that you are targeting and another tip

583
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,200
that i found is only have

584
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
one to two things or pieces of

585
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,360
information that you want to gather

586
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,840
during any social engineering

587
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
interaction

588
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,559
okay if this is a fish i have one thing

589
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,440
i want them to do

590
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,080
i either want them to tell me something

591
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,360
i want them to

592
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,880
give me um

593
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,799
some information about something i want

594
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,960
them to download

595
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,280
file take an action i want them to log

596
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,000
in one thing i want them to do

597
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,679
maybe i want them to log in and fill out

598
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,280
a form too

599
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,320
keep it at that don't start asking for a

600
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,400
bunch of information or you arouse

601
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,200
suspicions um so for example social

602
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,720
engineering engagement we did recently

603
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,320
it was fishing and

604
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,400
we wanted to we're working with a red

605
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
team with our red team

606
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,960
under the engagement and we wanted to

607
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,159
understand what kind of

608
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,840
input protection that we're using on our

609
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,320
system so that we could create a payload

610
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,559
um to connect our command control

611
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,799
infrastructure our server

612
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,720
so what we did i emailed the individual

613
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,919
about a problem with my antivirus

614
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,480
but looked like i was another employee

615
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,080
and i asked them were they

616
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
using the same antivirus um

617
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,159
as i was you know i told them the one i

618
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,840
was using i said no

619
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,640
mine is not bad and they i ended up

620
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,240
getting them to right click do the

621
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,360
properties

622
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,039
see the version and actually send me a

623
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,120
screenshot shot of exactly what they had

624
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,279
i had one piece of information i wanted

625
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,640
from this individual

626
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,880
not i'm not gonna also go start asking

627
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,640
them about what other

628
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,240
applications you see in control panel

629
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,080
when you log in do you have to do x y

630
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,440
and z

631
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,279
if i need to know that i'm going to go

632
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,279
to another individual and target them

633
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
and this actually can be very useful i

634
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,400
can build my knowledge

635
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,799
and i can ask something that seems

636
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,120
completely benign to you

637
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,159
person a take that information

638
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,200
use it in my question to person b and

639
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
because i know that they think it's i'm

640
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,080
legitimate

641
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
they give me the next piece of

642
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,520
information i take those two pieces of

643
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
information i know now and go to person

644
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,000
c

645
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,279
because i know these two things that

646
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,960
look even more legitimate and they give

647
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,480
me what i need to know and now

648
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,919
i have a complete understanding of

649
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,679
everything i need to know from three

650
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,000
different

651
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,240
people

652
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,080
then for your interaction you have to

653
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,840
think about your targets questions or

654
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
objections

655
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,320
another quick story

656
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,480
another fishing scenario i was able to

657
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,760
fish

658
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,159
a vice president of a company um we were

659
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,360
doing a pen test at

660
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,039
got his credentials and i need to bypass

661
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,679
multi-factor authentication

662
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,159
so i called the individual up i planned

663
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,159
out a scenario

664
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,919
to use and so the thing

665
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,559
with thinking about your questions and

666
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,159
this is something i heard when it came

667
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,360
to

668
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,120
espionage and tradecraft i heard someone

669
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
talk about

670
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,440
always prepare to never

671
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,720
run off the cuff to never add limb

672
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
but always be ready to outlive those are

673
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,039
the two rules of espionage they said

674
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,600
always be so prepared that you you know

675
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
everything you're gonna answer

676
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
you don't have to ad lib but if you have

677
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
to be ready to

678
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,200
and i had planned the scenario so that i

679
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,640
did not really have to do any adding

680
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
lips so what i did is i called the

681
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
individual up

682
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,799
and i told them i spoofed my phone

683
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,159
number to look like i was coming from

684
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,760
another facility

685
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,279
on the facility where their security

686
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,440
team worked at

687
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,120
i called him i told him that

688
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,960
um we had an issue with an

689
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
authentication server single sign-on

690
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,559
server

691
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,880
upgrade had gone south i purposely used

692
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,640
big terminology like single sign-on that

693
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,080
i knew he probably would not know the

694
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,000
meaning of

695
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
if things had gone south and people were

696
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,720
being locked out of their accounts

697
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,799
permanently we're having all kinds of

698
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,000
problems trying to get them back

699
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
in we see five different accounts

700
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,039
that are getting ready we locked out

701
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,279
next we're trying to

702
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,799
preempt this and i was going to

703
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,559
reauthenticate him so he did not get

704
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,240
locked out

705
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
because he had important things to do

706
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,640
that day

707
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,559
i told him i just needed to authenticate

708
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,159
him i was going to send him a code

709
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,600
and i needed him just read me that code

710
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
so i could type it in and he should be

711
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,039
good to go it wouldn't take a couple

712
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,799
minutes i had just done it with

713
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,080
another person whose name he knew and

714
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,360
it worked flawlessly for them

715
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,400
the he proceeds to

716
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,559
notice that my spoof number had a little

717
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,559
funny something about it it wasn't

718
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,320
coming from a straight extension

719
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
you want to know why my number looked

720
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,640
that way um so i answered them um

721
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,559
i'm not actually on vacation i'm in the

722
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,400
mountains

723
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,720
you know i said i'm on vacation and

724
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,520
because it was so bad i'm having to help

725
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,559
and he said where are you on vacation at

726
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,960
i had planned for this in case i got

727
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
that question

728
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,399
i said i'm in the mountains in tennessee

729
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,720
in a cabin i'm remoted on

730
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,440
and i'm trying to help and that's why my

731
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,200
phone number looks funny

732
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,559
ah okay i'm sorry to hear that you're

733
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,000
being pulled out of your vacation to do

734
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,679
this and now he feels bad for me and he

735
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,200
wants to help me get this done so i get

736
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,320
back to my vacation

737
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,880
i completely turned it on and sure

738
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,320
enough we were able to

739
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,399
pull it off get us codes bypass

740
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,840
two-factor authentication we're in the

741
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,159
vice president of the company's account

742
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,799
added our own phone numbers it's all

743
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
alternative 2fa and from then on we have

744
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,240
persistent access for the rest of that

745
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,760
engagement

746
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,159
but again the point of that story is

747
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,520
think ahead about

748
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,840
their questions their objections and how

749
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,039
you can overcome those

750
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,520
questions or objections without looking

751
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,840
like you really want that information

752
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,559
casually but also being ready to back

753
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,559
off if you need to

754
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,720
if um i did this on another engagement

755
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,679
um i asked an individual about their

756
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,960
antivirus

757
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
they didn't didn't want to answer me i

758
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,440
said look i completely understand

759
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,399
i'm glad you are cautious i'm glad you

760
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,520
don't want to give this information on

761
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,360
the phone that's really good

762
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,440
i'm going to send so and so down they're

763
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,559
going to come to your desk

764
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,600
i'll try to get them there in the next

765
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,720
30 minutes and let them get the

766
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,559
information you can send it to me

767
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,640
that put them at ease and they actually

768
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,919
gave me the information i wanted i

769
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,480
didn't have to

770
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,279
do anything

771
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,960
so what when we start with ocean or open

772
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,880
source intelligence to

773
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,440
have the information that we can use in

774
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,880
our attacks

775
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,559
where do we begin and search engines

776
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,840
number one you can find so much on

777
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,200
google

778
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,200
google is a hacker's goldmine

779
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,559
you can find all kinds of information

780
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,039
from google

781
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,960
so what i want to do is i want to walk

782
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
through a few what they're called

783
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,320
google dorks and there are ways to

784
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,120
do special searches within google and i

785
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,720
advise you to actually go look this up

786
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,799
the google door library there are tons

787
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,520
and tons

788
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,039
and there are very complex ones that you

789
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,039
can use you can be

790
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,320
fine put in certain searches that will

791
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,200
give you

792
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,039
certain server operating systems based

793
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,240
on headers and

794
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
all kinds of things you can do and so

795
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,200
you should really spend some time

796
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
getting familiar with them

797
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,760
i mean looking them up so a simple

798
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,200
putting something in quotes you're going

799
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
to search for that exact text if i put

800
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,919
in quotes at whitehouse.gov

801
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,440
i am going to get actual email addresses

802
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,640
if i put in text colon same thing

803
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,159
now it is looking for those email

804
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,640
addresses inside the

805
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,080
text or the body of the page

806
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
um maybe i want to look at a specific

807
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,919
website only

808
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,720
i can do site colon and then whatever i

809
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,240
want to search for now i'm only looking

810
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,880
for that

811
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
item on that single website

812
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,399
um if i'm trying to find subdomains that

813
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,760
a company might have i might use

814
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,000
something like crt.sh and look at the

815
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,440
certificate history

816
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,000
for subdomains or i might use this first

817
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,640
google door

818
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,880
here where it is sitecoincisco.com

819
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,399
and then the negate sign means not www

820
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,240
so what that effectively does

821
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,279
is i'm looking for anything cisco.com

822
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,320
but not www.cisco.com and i'm going to

823
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,919
get up but all the subdomains of

824
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,559
cisco.com

825
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,000
i might want to look for pdfs that have

826
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,640
been left

827
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,159
documents documented even less

828
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,919
unrealized with

829
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,679
something like confidential in the title

830
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,279
or passwords on that site

831
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,919
um and as i am creating my

832
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,519
social engineering dossier what i

833
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,840
typically do is i find

834
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,440
all the individuals who work for company

835
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,880
that i can

836
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,840
and i research each individual if a

837
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,399
social

838
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,399
engagement is going to last a week i

839
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,840
spend two weeks

840
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,720
prior learning as much as i can about

841
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,679
the individuals i'm going to be

842
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,320
targeting

843
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,640
or the ones who are in scope i want to

844
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
know

845
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,799
i'm looking for their email addresses

846
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,399
sensitive or confidential files like

847
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,679
those google docs we're just talking

848
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,159
about

849
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,320
presentation files has someone from

850
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,000
their comp company spoken at a

851
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,120
conference

852
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,200
and given a presentation that maybe that

853
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,799
presentation has information about some

854
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,720
of the technology they're using

855
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,840
events they've been to or are going to

856
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,640
um there's plenty of scenarios i can

857
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,240
create around events

858
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,320
um maybe they're going to an event and

859
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,679
they're excited they've been tweeting

860
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,080
about it or posting on facebook

861
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
and maybe they're sponsoring the event

862
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,240
and i can create a scenario where oh we

863
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,519
forgot to have you sign this one

864
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,000
document

865
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,279
can you download this and sign it and

866
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,360
that's a malicious document

867
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,760
any awards or recognitions they received

868
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,440
i talked about the story about how we

869
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,000
use that

870
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,360
their children's names because that's

871
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,799
something they might be using in their

872
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,080
passwords

873
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,519
if i'm going to do a password spray and

874
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,000
i'm gonna create my own dictionary

875
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,960
pets names they're dogs or cats um i

876
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,799

that will give me information and i

881
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,360
could

882
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
create scenarios around this information

883
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,799
or i can put those

884
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,000
keywords into a script while creating a

885
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,640
password

886
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,519
dictionary to use in either brute force

887
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,080
or

888
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,279
password spring attacks

889
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,120
um the way back to archive time machine

890
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,399
is another good

891
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,279
uh resource you can look on websites who

892
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,640
has worked in the past because you can

893
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,919
go back and look at history things

894
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,200

895

google news if i'm looking for in this

898
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,159

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,799
reconnaissance on or ocean

902
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,000

hitting news in google and i can get

904

announcements they've made

906
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,200
again email addresses are very valuable

907
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,960
and some ways i can get email addresses

908
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,200
are the first the google doc i mentioned

909
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,000
earlier just

910
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,960
simply putting quotes at that domain dot

911
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,799
their domain ending

912
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,159
there's a tool in cali called the

913
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,960
harvester um and the command to run is

914
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,480
simply the harvester dash d

915
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
domain i'm in the white house you're

916
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,840
looking i mean the domain you're looking

917
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,240
for in this case it's whitehouse.gov

918
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,080
and it will search and you can also

919
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,440
specify what

920
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,040
search engines to search through i can

921
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,639
specify being google except firefox etc

922
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,879
and it will pull email addresses for

923
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,239
that domain

924
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,079
um if you know

925
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,560
um you found a domain or an email

926
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,520
address and you're

927
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,760
unsure you want to verify it you can use

928
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,199
this linkedin

929
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,040
um that particular address for the

930
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,480
individual

931
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,199
and you can see if that email address is

932
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,560
legitimate or not

933
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,079
if it's only used for their linkedin

934
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,399
account

935
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,040
i always want to know where email is

936
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,520
going

937
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,079
so i'll typically use something like the

938
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,239
mx toolbox or a similar tool

939
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,918
um put in the domain figure out where

940
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,918
their mx records are pointing to so this

941
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,199
company

942
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,040
um their mx records are pointing to

943
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,359
satos so i know they're using a

944
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,320
softbox email security filter if they're

945
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,079
pointing straight to microsoft then

946
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,440
my job is a lot easier because microsoft

947
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,400
doesn't do the best job filtering emails

948
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,320
and this also will give me can give me

949
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,839
some information on what tools i need to

950
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,960
use

951
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
if the company is using microsoft office

952
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,119
365 as an email

953
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,880
maybe i'm going to buy a legitimate

954
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,640
domain set up

955
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,800
use office 365 to send that because

956
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,440
office 365 is going to trust office 365

957
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,400
right

958
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
unless i do something super fishy or

959
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,160
spammy it's going to go straight to

960
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,839
their inbox and not get caught in spam

961
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,960
filters

962
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,240
if they're using um the g suite

963
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,400
platform google platform with g suite

964
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,520
maybe i will

965
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,680
set up my email using g suite so it will

966
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,920
again be trusted

967
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,520
and go through and straight to their

968
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,720
inbox without being filtered

969
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,079
of course social media you can find all

970
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,520
kinds of information about individuals

971
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,640

about this

1017
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,000
i know they like donuts maybe that

1018
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,440
becomes a scenario if i'm going to do

1019
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,720
physical

1020
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,800
penetration testing maybe i wait for

1021
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
this individual to come

1022
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,480
and i have a box of donuts in my hand i

1023
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,760
need an open door for me

1024
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,640
i'm in this picture it seems like

1025
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,000
there's not a lot but there's a lot to

1026
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,119
be learned

1027
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,160
i know the opera system they're using i

1028
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,680
see the kind of phone they're using as a

1029
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,119
voice phone so maybe i can create a

1030
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,800
scenario where i'm sending

1031
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,560
quote a voicemail that they need to open

1032
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,160
i see that there's no printer on this

1033
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,680
individual's desk so maybe they're using

1034
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,920
a shared printer in this office

1035
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
maybe i can create a phishing email that

1036
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,359
is quote you got a scan

1037
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,920
from x printer and that might seem

1038
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,640
normal to them

1039
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,599
now again badges this is great

1040
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,720
information for me

1041
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,280
i know exactly what the badges look like

1042
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,599
um

1043
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,480
i if these are rfid maybe i create a

1044
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
backpack scanner i bump into them

1045
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,640
outside i clone their rfid

1046
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,720
now i can create a badge that looks

1047
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,480
legitimate

1048
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,200
again more badges i see the barcode i

1049
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,680
see

1050
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,359
how they're set up i see employees

1051
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,839
there's lots of information to be gained

1052
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,560
a couple other places when it comes to

1053
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
instagram you can use

1054
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,400
or social media in general is

1055
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,920
igstory.com you can look up individuals

1056
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,240
search my bio

1057
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,760
pull from different social media

1058
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,079
accounts

1059
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,160
twitter of course is a great resource

1060
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,640
for conducting

1061
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,960
ocean learning about an individual

1062
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
it's a company i can see who the

1063
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,359
followers are maybe their employees are

1064
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,119
among those followers

1065
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,480
let me start figuring out who employees

1066
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,720
are who works with who

1067
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,280
i can see any recent events they've had

1068
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,040
any changes

1069
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,960
announcements they may upcoming events

1070
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,040
they're going to and like that

1071
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,119
scenario i mentioned a few minutes ago

1072
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,800
um you're going to this event hey i

1073
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,240
forgot to send you this one document i

1074
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,040
need you to sign

1075
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
and there's a payload done document or

1076
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,720
something they need to run

1077
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,440
um if i'm targeting a building

1078
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,760
for physical penetration testing now

1079
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,599
it's getting less common for people to

1080
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,599
do geo-tagging alert images but it still

1081
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,720
does happen

1082
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,280
i mean you can use this search on

1083
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,400
twitter

1084
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,440
let me put in a geocode and

1085
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,680
all right so if you go and you find the

1086
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,440
coordinates of the building

1087
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,040
i can put in the coordinates of that

1088
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,480
building and the radius i want to search

1089
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,640
and then anything on twitter

1090
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,760
that has been um

1091
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,880
geotagged within that radius i will get

1092
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,000
those

1093
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,839
search results those in my search

1094
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,000
results those images what that might be

1095
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,760
i can start piecing information together

1096
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,400
about company

1097
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,760
whether people are going around that

1098
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,839
company maybe the restaurants are

1099
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,359
visiting frequently because

1100
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,560
it's within that radius um of course you

1101
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,319
can the company you're looking at

1102
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,079
uh you can look at the media that's my

1103
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,680
company by the way cyborg security

1104
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,839
that's our twitter handle

1105
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,160
you can look at the media find images um

1106
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,240
you can go to tweetbeaver.com

1107
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
you can download friends followers

1108
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,160
conversations they've been a part of

1109
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,319
there's lots of information we gather

1110
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,760
using social media

1111
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,880
linkedin a great resource for osint

1112
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,440
i can find employees names i know what

1113
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,880
department they worked in

1114
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,280
what certifications they have i've used

1115
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,520
that in the past against people

1116
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,599
certification tests renewals etc

1117
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,760
i know their responsibilities what they

1118
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,119
do for day to day

1119
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,359
some people mention the specific tools

1120
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,920
they're using

1121
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,720
and now i can find out bosses names

1122
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,760
who's whose boss

1123
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,440
who's our own departments based on their

1124
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,760
titles again some of the solutions and

1125
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,880
software that are in use

1126
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,480
if their bios are too specific

1127
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,000
lots of information you can gain on

1128
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,680
linkedin

1129
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,800
um and finally another great resource is

1130
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,160
communities and forums stack overflow

1131
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,520
people are going to these forums they're

1132
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,400
asking questions

1133
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,040
things like stack overflow spice works

1134
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,079
um

1135
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,280
these are more on the tech side of

1136
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,760
things but there's other forms

1137
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,480
for other departments as well finance um

1138
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,960
and

1139
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,800
so if i'm targeting this company right

1140
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,480
here and i've identified a user

1141
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,440
maybe by a handle they use i see they

1142
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:57,680
see

1143
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,920
the same hand on twitter twitter as they

1144
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
use on instagram as they use everywhere

1145
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,599
else

1146
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,319
or if i they use their name straight on

1147
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,040
there

1148
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,079
or their company name and in this case

1149
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,960
as you see i know exactly the version of

1150
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,160
software they're using i know they're

1151
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,920
using esxi 6.5 they're using pfsense

1152
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,880
2.4.4

1153
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,240
i see a little bit about what they've

1154
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,920
tried their setup

1155
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,599
and this is great information for me as

1156
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,319
an attacker we found

1157
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,560
code basis which we'll get to in a

1158
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,079
second github

1159
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,839
repositories there might be hard-coded

1160
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,280
credentials in

1161
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,680
and there might be keywords comments

1162
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,560
left in

1163
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,319
describing things that are very can be

1164
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,920
very useful for me as an attacker

1165
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,280
um documents again i mentioned

1166
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,520
um the file type and this is from a real

1167
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,200
penetration test that we did

1168
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
um this was a confidential document that

1169
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,119
had been put on a website

1170
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,640
not realized it was accessible to the

1171
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,480
public trying to share it with some

1172
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,440
people

1173
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,359
and this was available to us and i can

1174
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,839
look for powerpoints pdfs documents text

1175
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,040
files

1176
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,960
excel spreadsheets csvs

1177
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,880
um and videos um like

1178
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,040
like i mentioned if i'm targeting

1179
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,319
someone i'm going to try

1180
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,319
to find some videos of them i want to

1181
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,520
know the words they use

1182
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,200
how they talk and if i'm going to have a

1183
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,800
phone conversation with them i'm going

1184
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,000
to talk like them

1185
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
i'm going to use the words they use and

1186
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,119
they're going to like me because i am

1187
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,839
like them

1188
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,560
of course ip addresses you can use

1189
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
things like showdan

1190
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,480
to put in a company's domain find ip

1191
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,839
addresses mail servers

1192
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,960
related ip addresses

1193
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,160
so we understand social engineering

1194
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,119
attacks are dangerous

1195
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,440
we have a high success rate typically on

1196
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,880
our engagements we typically have

1197
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,640
between a 40 and a 50

1198
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,119
click rate and we typically get

1199
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,040
credentials

1200
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,880
um for at least 15

1201
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,160
and we can typically bypass multi-factor

1202
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,680
authentication with ease

1203
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,800
and that's over that's our

1204
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,200
average over many games sometimes we are

1205
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,800
more successful sometimes less

1206
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
but that's about our average i mean

1207
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,240
that's bad

1208
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,599
for the companies being targeted that's

1209
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,160
bad we know it's

1210
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,720
a problem and the reason we're doing

1211
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,200
this

1212
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,680
is to train them right we're doing this

1213
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,920
to help the company improve

1214
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,520
we're not bad guys we want to help the

1215
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,520
company improve so what can we do

1216
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,280
to train employees i want to spend a

1217
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,720
couple minutes on this to do better

1218
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,839
um sorry

1219
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,920
i'm getting a little bit of myself um so

1220
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,040
i want to show you a couple of fake

1221
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,640
portals um this is one thing we've done

1222
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,920
engagements

1223
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,040
um it's been very successful

1224
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,079
um and in this case

1225
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,319
we'll buy a legitimate domain set up a

1226
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,839
real website

1227
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:56,800
maybe we're using something like

1228
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
wordpress or some other template we can

1229
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
put together real fast

1230
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,640
um this is for email

1231
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,480
phishing um for a fake 401 website

1232
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,839
um and this is the real 401k

1233
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,240
website um and this is our fake portal

1234
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,160
that we can set up as you can see

1235
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,960
they're pretty similar most people would

1236
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,359
fall for it

1237
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,760
this is a state office 365 portal we set

1238
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,400
up

1239
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,119
a fake linkedin portal fake owa portal

1240
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,720
i mean again they look very legitimate

1241
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,319
to a user we always have

1242
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,839
https certificates

1243
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,119
so they look even more legitimate

1244
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,200
they're not getting much warnings

1245
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,480
maybe i'm trying to get them installed

1246
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,480
some kind of software an app a malicious

1247
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,640
document is a good attack method

1248
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
um and this is an example of an

1249
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,160
engagement we did someone

1250
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,079
tweeted about the test they had failed

1251
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,079
the oscp defensive security certified

1252
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,599
professional exam

1253
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,319
and so we bought a domain very similar

1254
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,040
to the real

1255
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,920
domain we sent them an email saying hey

1256
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
we realize that everyone who took the

1257
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,760
test on certain days

1258
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
um we gave them the wrong

1259
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,560
testing environment we're really sorry i

1260
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,440
want to give you the opportunity to

1261
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,800
retake the test for free

1262
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,319
please fill out these questions so we

1263
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,160
can get the ball rolling um

1264
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,680
and this was actually a security analyst

1265
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,200
at this company they downloaded the form

1266
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,960
which was payloaded gave us the command

1267
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,200
shell

1268
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,160
so now on to what i was getting ready to

1269
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,920
get to how do we change this how do we

1270
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,520
improve

1271
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,960
and security awareness training is

1272
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,760
important

1273
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,920
but i also like to recommend what i call

1274
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,440
an ocean self-assessment

1275
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,440
take a few minutes and encourage the

1276
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,960
employees that you're either testing or

1277
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,560
at your company to do this as well

1278
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,760
encourage them to take a few minutes

1279
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,440
and go look at their web life

1280
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,119
their web presence go look at social

1281
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,200
media what kinds of things are known

1282
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,960
about me

1283
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,920
look at the pictures of you what can be

1284
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,760
inferred about you from those pictures

1285
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,800
what do people know about you before you

1286
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,839
post something

1287
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,480
do an assessment what is the information

1288
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,319
this photo in this

1289
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,119
tweet and this message i'm about to post

1290
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,960
what is it because that is now public

1291
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,319
about me

1292
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,880
and now i'm going to be cognizant if

1293
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,240
that information is

1294
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,800
an attacker trying to target me i know

1295
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,440
hey

1296
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,000
that's public information you're using

1297
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,640
that against me

1298
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,000
next never trust always verify

1299
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,559
you always teach employees to always

1300
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,559
verify if there's a question

1301
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,119
about something if they have a hesitance

1302
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:43,920
ask

1303
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,400
don't be afraid create an environment

1304
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,480
where people are encouraged to verify

1305
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,839
they're encouraged not to take action

1306
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,640
swiftly

1307
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,000
and do that verification out of ban so

1308
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,680
if someone sends me an email i'm not

1309
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,040
sure about i'm going to call them up on

1310
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,839
the phone

1311
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,440
i'm not going to use the phone number in

1312
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,720
the signature i'm going to go to their

1313
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,520
website

1314
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,440
go to my contact list the phone number i

1315
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,800
know for them

1316
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,559
if they call me up and i start asking

1317
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,240
questions and say hey

1318
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,680
i know you have a job to do i want to

1319
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,040
verify i'm going to send you an email

1320
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,559
to your email address and just reply

1321
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,760
back to that i know you're legitimate

1322
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,319
um don't change to some email just they

1323
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:26,800
tell you

1324
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,960
do the one you know for them and verify

1325
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,920
it

1326
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,119
do some kind of alternate method than

1327
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,280
what they are communicating with you on

1328
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,200
um and as an attacker that's the worst

1329
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,559
thing i can hear i'm going to send you

1330
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:39,920
an email because i know i'm not going to

1331
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,240
get it

1332
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,680
um and the final tip i have is teach

1333
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,599
individuals this if an email

1334
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,880
a exchange interaction causes any

1335
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,400
kind of emotion be that fear excitement

1336
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,440
anxiety pressure again from authority

1337
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,960
compassion pride happiness

1338
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,079
any kind of emotion stop

1339
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,640
stop reading that email don't take any

1340
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,079
action

1341
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,520
go do something else for five minutes

1342
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,200
and come back and read it again

1343
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,800
when you're thinking clearly and you're

1344
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,240
out of that emotion

1345
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,079
because it's likely not to be real and

1346
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,280
you're going to be in a better state of

1347
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,160
mind

1348
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,000
if you have to ask a for one a co-worker

1349
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,200
what do you think about this and if you

1350
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,640
do this you're going to stop

1351
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
your employees the people you're

1352
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,160
training to stop

1353
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,559
so many such a high percentage of

1354
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,960
attacks

1355
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,160
if you're looking for some resources to

1356
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,680
learn even more about

1357
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,160
some open source intelligence and this

1358
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,920
is a great book

1359
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,599
open source intelligent techniques by

1360
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,960
michael bazelle

1361
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,880
you can pick it up on amazon i think

1362
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,559
it's between 30 and 40 dollars

1363
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,359
not terrible but there's like tons and

1364
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,040
tons of tools in there

1365
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,280
that he goes through one by one on how

1366
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,599
to use them how to

1367
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,359
conduct those ten investigations

1368
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,079
and finally um here is a qr code that

1369
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,359
you can scan if you trust me

1370
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,800
it'll give you the slides for this

1371
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,760
presentation if you're interested in
