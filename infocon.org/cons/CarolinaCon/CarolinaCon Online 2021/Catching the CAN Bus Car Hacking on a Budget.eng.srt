1
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,800
all right

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
hey everyone i'm rachel velasco

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,080
welcome to my intro to car hacking talk

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,359
i am excited to be back at carolinacon

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,640
and thanks y'all for coming out this is

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,239
catching the canvas

7
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,919
car hacking on a budget

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,079
so again i'm rachel based locally here

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,680
in charlotte

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
i've been in pen testing for a little

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,879
while now

12
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,000
and i'm psyched to be joining ibm xforce

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
red this summer

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
i'm also working on my masters in cyber

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
security

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,760
and i'm a graduate of the sans institute

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,960
women's academy which is a great

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,680
scholarship

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,159
program if you're looking to start out

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,159
in infosec

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,960
outside of work and school i'm all about

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,000
supporting

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,119
underserved communities in stem as

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,560
i am a part of many of those communities

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
i'm a next-gen leader with disability

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
inn

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
i am part of the north carolina

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,040
affiliate

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,799
of women in cyber security

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,920
and i most recently became the

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
us east coast coordinator for filipinos

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,320
in computing

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,840
which is an anita borg sisters

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,320
organization

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
i was a musician before i got into

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,720
infosec so you do not have to be

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,280
a car expert to start car hacking

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,439
so what is car hacking first let me tell

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,640
you the story

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
that drew me to all of this in the first

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,479
place

42
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,280
we have andy greenberg a writer for

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,960
wired magazine

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,159
going 70 down the highway in a 2014

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,598
jeep cherokee hackers charlie miller and

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,639
chris fallisek

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,599
are miles away telling him as they begin

48
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
their exploit

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,239
we're not going to do anything

50
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,319
life-threatening so don't panic

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
but they didn't tell him what kind of

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,800
attacks i had in store for him

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,520
the two start by putting the ac on full

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,239
blast

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
which is pretty tame they cycle through

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,720
radio stations

57
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,879
and turn the music up to a deafening

58
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,480
volume

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
greenberg tries to undo this but he

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
can't change

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,680
any of what they've done then they spray

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,640
wiper fluid

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,599
all over the windshield having your view

64
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
obstructed while going 70 miles an hour

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,720
isn't scary enough for you miller and

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,319
valasek just completely kill the engine

67
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,760
justifiably greenberg freaks out

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,319
guys i really need the accelerator to

69
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
work again

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
they tell him to basically turn off the

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,319
car and turn it back on again

72
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,239
just so he can regain control of his own

73
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,239
vehicle

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,159
this wasn't the first time that the

75
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,239
three of them collaborated on a car

76
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,800
hacking story

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
before this miller and valasek were in

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,879
the back seat

79
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,040
directly connected to what is called the

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
can bus

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
to terrorize poor greenberg who was

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
driving

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
this time they used the car's onboard

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,519
wi-fi to remotely attack the can bus

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
and as of the writing of this article

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,599
greenberg hasn't quite forgiven them yet

87
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,799
and because of this high profile hack

88
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
pricer recalled more than eight million

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,200
vehicles

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
i do have spoken about this at several

91
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
conferences like defcon

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
and black hat you can find a lot of

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
their talks on youtube and read up on

94
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,920
the research for free on illmatics

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,159
now let's talk about abusing keyless

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,000
entry

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,040
security researcher sami kamkar sami is

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,319
my hero

99
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,040
developed the roll jam in 2015 for under

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
50

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
the device would intercept and store the

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,399
signal from a car remote

103
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,600
that was currently unlocking its vehicle

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
and could transmit that same signal

105
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
later to unlock the

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
car again there's a little more to it

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,600
than that but that's the gist of it

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
two years later as shown in the video

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,040
these two men

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
are using a really attack unit to trick

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
the car into thinking that

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,720
it's keys in within range and so the car

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
unlocks

114
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
another two years later evanconnect on

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
youtube

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,120
has uploaded a video of a device with

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
the same functionality and he's selling

118
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,720
it for

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
nine thousand dollars

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
sami camcar said he can't verify the

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,639
authenticity of the evan connect video

122
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,160
but says it's still plausible

123
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,400
based on the state of hardware nowadays

124
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,120
and on his own research

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,919
so hacking cars to steal them isn't

126
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,360
sci-fi anymore

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,400
this is an actual threat

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,080
look at him driving away with the car

129
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,359
goodbye mercedes

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,240
however hacking cars does not

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,880
automatically make you a criminal

132
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
there are lots of fun things you can

133
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
achieve with automotive hacking

134
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,479
like improving the functionality of your

135
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
vehicle or using it for gaming

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
first we have makina on the left

137
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,960
they fashion a way to start their car

138
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
using if this and that and other iot

139
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
technologies

140
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
all i gotta say is okay google start my

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
car

142
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,199
next is open pilot top right

143
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,880
developed by comma ai which is an open

144
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,360
source

145
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,639
project meant to improve already

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,840
existing

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,120
driver assistance technologies like

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,319
adaptive cruise control and automated

149
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,550
lane centering unfortunately

150
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,919
[Music]

151
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,720
the hardware is expensive and the list

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080
of supported cars

153
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,280
is still relatively small but that list

154
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,600
continues to grow

155
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
and finally in the bottom right we have

156
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
researcher pikachu

157
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,880
using his lame ass front-wheel drive car

158
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,400
to drift in a game of course

159
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
he's converted his mother's fiat 500c

160
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,319
into a gaming controller and ended up

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,520
developing the cam pad

162
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,520
so the can bus this is what we use to

163
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,560
actually

164
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
hack cars can is the

165
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,440
controller area network cars now come

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,039
with lots of little computers

167
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,240
called electronic control units or ecu's

168
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
and there are many kinds of ecu's

169
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,840
there is transmission control engine

170
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
control brake control

171
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,599
what i have on the slide is not an

172
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,000
exhaustive list

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,240
there could be one for controlling doors

174
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
telematics for

175
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,759
cruise control basically any

176
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
functionality the car could have its own

177
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
ec

178
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,160
and rather than connecting all the ecu's

179
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
through a mesh

180
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,400
they're all on a centralized bus became

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,319
a bus

182
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,800
the cam bus is more like a highway

183
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,080
rather than the bus

184
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
i alluded to in the title

185
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
implementations of can vary by

186
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,440
manufacturer

187
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
so you have lots of different flavors to

188
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
reverse engineer

189
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,319
and luckily can is low level and not

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,599
encrypted

191
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
so you can inject your own data onto the

192
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,680
bus

193
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,080
the easiest way to access the can bus is

194
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,160
through the obd2 port

195
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
commonly found in accessible areas such

196
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
as under the steering wheel like in this

197
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
gift

198
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,960
obd is onboard diagnostics which became

199
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,000
standard in the us

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,960
in 96.

201
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,720
so let's recap the different ways to

202
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
attack cars

203
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,680
first and easiest is physically using

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,000
the

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
obd2 port to directly access the can bus

206
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
next we can use other networks that

207
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
could be present like

208
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,320
wifi bluetooth or even through the

209
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
infotainment system

210
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,360
we have keyless entry and lastly

211
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
or more cars have mobile apps so these

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
could be used to gain control of your

213
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
vehicle as well

214
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,279
we're going to be looking at the

215
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
instrument cluster simulator by craig

216
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
smith

217
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,600
let me pull up my vm for y'all

218
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,120
alrighty so now let's dive

219
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,480
into the instrument cluster simulator

220
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,120
or icsim

221
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,279
it's running by installing the

222
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,320
dependencies for

223
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,320
it

224
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,800
so as you all can see i am using parrot

225
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,040
but really just use any linux distro

226
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,760
that you want

227
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,320
and what this does sdl

228
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,279
it renders the images and audio for the

229
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
simulator

230
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,880
awesome now we're going to be

231
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,320
installing can utilities so this is

232
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,600
installed by default on parrot but that

233
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
is the command if you're not using

234
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,959
parrot

235
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,399
cool now we're going to grab

236
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,600
the actual simulator

237
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,839
from craig smith's here we go

238
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,079
over to that directory see what we got

239
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,079
oh we have this setup script

240
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,600
and what it does is start up a virtual

241
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
can interface for

242
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,079
us to use so let's actually run that

243
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,839
let's confirm that

244
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,399
virtual can is up and it is cool

245
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,360
so now let's actually start up the

246
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,160
simulator

247
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
all right so here is what's called an

248
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
instrument cluster

249
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,959
um on this we just have the speedometer

250
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,079
left turn right turn indicators and an

251
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,839
overhead view of the car

252
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,959
on other instrument clusters you'll see

253
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,839
something for your fuel gauge other

254
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,680
indicators um

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,839
but this is all we're going to be using

256
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,040
in this emulator

257
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,880
so let's if he controls that

258
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,279
you can use a physical controller for

259
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,560
this but

260
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,839
i will just be using my keyboard

261
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
all right i'm going to hold the up arrow

262
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,920
see the needle going up on the

263
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,160
speedometer

264
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,839
holding down the right arrow left arrow

265
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,880
oh everything's working

266
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,600
let's take a peek into the canvas

267
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,040
you're ready so this is the campus

268
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,120
it is super noisy even though we're not

269
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
actively sending any comments

270
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
it would be nice to know

271
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
what are these message what these

272
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,800
messages do

273
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,480
so we're gonna hold down accelerate

274
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,800
but we still have no clue which of these

275
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
messages

276
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,040
since the accelerate command

277
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,720
so what we're gonna do is dump this

278
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,600
into a text file

279
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,880
and i want to figure out

280
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,519
what message

281
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,160
sends the command to turn the left turn

282
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,959
indicator on

283
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,959
on this so let's start the dump

284
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,639
i'm gonna hold the left arrow

285
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,480
so that the indicator blinks 10 times

286
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,959
3 4 5

287
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,160
6 7 8

288
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,839
9 10. we are going to look for

289
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,360
a message that was

290
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,959
in the canvas 10 times

291
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,320
now i will not be looking at it just

292
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
like that

293
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
we're going to sort through this

294
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
and we are going to look for the ones

295
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,720
that

296
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
came through 10 times

297
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,839
all right so we have these to try

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,040
so this is what your camera message

299
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,160
looks like this is the id number

300
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,279
how big the message is and the actual

301
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,639
data

302
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,279
so what we're going to do is send each

303
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,160
of these back

304
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,279
individually and see if anyone triggers

305
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,680
the left turn indicator all right

306
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,920
so we're going to be using can send for

307
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,240
this

308
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
we can we are starting off with the id

309
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
number

310
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,360
so it's this first three digit uh number

311
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,920
right there

312
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
the pound sign and then the actual

313
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,519
contents

314
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,560
packet one

315
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,800
fb

316
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
so you can see nothing happens so we're

317
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
just going to try all these until

318
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,320
bottom one it turns on

319
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,360
electron indicator

320
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
nice

321
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,410
[Music]

322
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,399
nothing

323
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,360
still nothing

324
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
yeah so we have one left

325
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,440
you try 88

326
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,360
and you see it blinked so we can send

327
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,839
back

328
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,560
this message as many times as we want

329
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,199
and that is the very basics

330
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,920
of car hacking and reverse engineering

331
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,480
you've only scratched the surface but

332
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,279
let's move on

333
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,440
all right now that we've taken a look at

334
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,199
icsu

335
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
we can go more into about starting your

336
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,600
own research workbench

337
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,279
you probably don't want to sift through

338
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,000
cam messages in plain text files

339
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,959
so here's some free applications that

340
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,759
you can use

341
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,759
some you're already familiar with most

342
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,199
likely

343
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,199
you could actually use wireshark for can

344
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,320
sniffing or

345
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,600
metasploit hardware bridge

346
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,559
you want something more cam focused

347
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,520
hearing caribou

348
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
and kayak are great places to start and

349
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,559
they

350
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,559
are installed on parrot by default

351
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,039
next we gotta find a way to connect our

352
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,520
computers to our cars

353
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,720
toyota researchers developed the pasta

354
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,359
the portable automotive security testbed

355
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,280
with adaptability

356
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
it's a very cool open source tool that

357
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,080
comes in a shiny heavy briefcase

358
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,240
and you can get your own for a whopping

359
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,200
28 thousand dollars

360
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,960
you might as well just buy a car at that

361
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,480
point

362
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,799
now the pasta is not actually meant to

363
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,960
perform live car hacks it's

364
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
more for brushing up on your skills

365
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,919
before moving on to actual car hacking

366
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,559
so this is a very expensive i see sim

367
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,600
now that you have some idea on why this

368
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,919
talk is called car hiking on a budget

369
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,000
here are some actual budget-friendly

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
pieces

371
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
that you can grab for live automotive

372
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,120
packs

373
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
non-display supports the elm 327

374
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
bluetooth dongle

375
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,840
like the one in the bottom left and

376
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,960
these go for less than twenty dollars

377
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
it's a little slow and upgrade is for

378
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
sniffing but you can still

379
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,039
transmit raw cam packets using this

380
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,440
dongle

381
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,160
minty net has been developing the nano

382
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,640
can bus for a while

383
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
which can get made for super cheap

384
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
he's also been working on a lot of

385
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,160
simulators and a value version

386
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,160
of the toyota pasta

387
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
lastly we have a couple of devices in

388
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
the 50 to 100

389
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,919
range so we have the car loop in the

390
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
middle

391
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,120
you can grab one of the makino devices

392
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
like the one on the bottom right i think

393
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,440
that one is the m2

394
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,720
and the contact i personally have a

395
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,640
contact

396
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,120
and i just got a hold of the

397
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
cantack pro so feel free to splurge on

398
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,160
more expensive devices when you have the

399
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,880
budget for it

400
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,600
now we just need a cam bus if you can go

401
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
out and buy a brand new car

402
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,039
awesome definitely do that if you can't

403
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,400
we have some more

404
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
options that are easier on the wallet

405
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,600
the ideal situation is grabbing

406
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
a vehicle from a junkyard with its

407
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,960
engine

408
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,799
and electronic cylinder maybe something

409
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,240
in the early 2010s

410
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,760
you could take it apart to give your

411
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,919
test bench more portability

412
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,559
and easier accessibility to the

413
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,000
different components

414
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,480
but that is not required at all

415
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,960
alternatively you can grab some ecu's

416
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,840
off of ebay

417
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,880
and stick them on a go-kart

418
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,360
now this last one i do not recommend

419
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,559
you can use your daily driver

420
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,280
now this is super dangerous especially

421
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,760
if that's the only car you have

422
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,600
so again i do not recommend doing this

423
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
you might accidentally get your horn

424
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,880
stuck and have it blur for all of

425
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,679
eternity

426
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,679
or when fuzzing blow your airbags out

427
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,080
or even void your warranty but hackers

428
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,400
don't care about that

429
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,919
and yes you could improve the

430
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,200
functionality of your own vehicle but

431
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,360
again not something i recommend

432
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,280
there's more resources i have two books

433
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,039
here on the connectivity of

434
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,159
cars there's this recent one

435
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,520
by alissa knight i can connect in cars

436
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,720
there is also this heavier one

437
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,320
by moeller and haas the guide to

438
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,799
automotive connectivity and cyber

439
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,000
security

440
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,240
i apologize if i did not pronounce their

441
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,840
names correctly

442
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,440
but my go-to is craig smith's

443
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,400
car hackers handbook so even though it's

444
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
a little dated

445
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
the foundations and concepts are still

446
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
pretty solid

447
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
he has a free version of this up on the

448
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,600
internet if you want to check it out

449
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,440
but i like having physical copies

450
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,559
i think i saw that he was working on a

451
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,880
second revision of this so

452
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
you might be getting an update soon

453
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,840
so some communities to reach out to

454
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,960
craig smith has open garages

455
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
if there isn't one near you he has some

456
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
detailed instructions on starting your

457
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,320
own open garage

458
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
asrg the automotive security research

459
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,760
group

460
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,520
has several chapters in the u.s and

461
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,120
worldwide

462
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,679
they host monthly events and training

463
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,600
and they've been

464
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,159
they've been really helpful from the

465
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,960
events that i attended

466
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,200
there's also the car hacking subreddit

467
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
and

468
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,880
it seems like a safe space to ask

469
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,360
questions and see what other projects

470
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,080
that everyone else is working on um i

471
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
haven't had any

472
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,320
issues in there so far and

473
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,880
of course we have the car hacking

474
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
village

475
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,240
i had a wonderful experience with them

476
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,440
at defcon

477
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
they're all really friendly and love

478
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,559
helping people start out in car hacking

479
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,240
they're starting to do more virtual

480
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,640
conferences like pancakes cons so

481
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
definitely check them out at their next

482
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,360
online event

483
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,600
so after all this if you've decided you

484
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
don't want to hack cars

485
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,080
no problem there are a couple things you

486
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,880
can do to

487
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,480
secure your vehicle as with all your

488
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
other electronics

489
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,240
keep the software updated if you have a

490
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
newer car

491
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,679
you can usually do this using a flash

492
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,440
drive or just bring your car to your

493
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,360
dealer

494
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,559
lock down bluetooth and wi-fi use

495
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,880
memorable passphrases so you don't have

496
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,720
to keep changing your pet's name

497
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
last you can prevent relay attacks by

498
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,280
storing keys

499
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,000
in a fairy day bag so these stop the

500
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,559
signals out

501
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,320
from getting out for about roughly 20

502
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
dollars depending on how big of a bag

503
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
you want

504
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,279
and where the chances some hacker is

505
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,200
going to drop a zero day to steal your

506
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,320
car

507
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,039
it's not very high but it's also not

508
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,320
zero

509
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,760
if you don't want to deal with any of

510
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,840
this just get an old car

511
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,840
or don't have a car at all

512
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,840
