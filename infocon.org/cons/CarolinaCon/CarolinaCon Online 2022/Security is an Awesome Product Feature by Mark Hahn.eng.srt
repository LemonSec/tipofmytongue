1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
so welcome to my talk um i am uh

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,960
director of cloud strategies sre and

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,000
devops

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,440
uh 30 years of building software so

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,000
and delivering it and and maintaining an

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
operating software for trading companies

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
supply chain systems

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,279
retail payment systems so

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,080
a lot of experience in in building and

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
delivering application software and so i

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
come at security

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,560
very much from an application-centric

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
point of view what do

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,120
what do i as what what do i as a

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,320
developer

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,480
really need to take into account for

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
security how do i deliver a product

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
that's that's trustworthy and reliable

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,200
and doesn't page me in the middle of the

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,760
night and doesn't have you know great

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,160
big oh my gosh what's going on with this

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,199
kind of uh kind of problems

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,480
so

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,160
um

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,440
that's that's the way this talk is

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,719
structured it was

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,120
um inspired by a quote that was on the

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
breaking down security podcast which you

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,119
should um check

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,600
uh check out by the way if you want to

the particular diagrams and so forth

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
with me but this talk was inspired by a

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,320
comment that was made on the breaking

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
down security podcast

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
um teams want to work on awesome

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
features development teams want to work

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,400
on awesome features not security

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,840
but what they don't realize is that

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,240
security is an awesome feature it's an

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
awesome product feature and that's what

50
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
i'm here to do is to help you

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
frame the conversation with your

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,079
development teams that are developing

53
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,360
software in your organization as a

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
as a product feature

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
that brings value to the product brings

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,439
value to the organization

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,159
um so i'm an agile software developer

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,799
i've been doing

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
methods like scrum and kanban since

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
before those terms were developed or

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,038
applied to

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,120
applied to software development

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,879
and one of the things that we've that

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,560
we've tried to do that i've tried to do

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,400
over time is make sure that the software

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,120
that i build is is trustworthy

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,720
trustworthy myself that is can i um

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
can i actually run this software and not

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,080
get woken up in the middle of night not

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,040
have

71
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,680
mana huge risks from it

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,200
but how do i do that and what are the

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
capabilities which is how i got into

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
security in the first place was that i

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,879
realized that a lot of the software that

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,879
i was working with needed much much

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,160
better security controls than i was uh

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
understood at the time in the 90s and so

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
learned a lot about security and uh and

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,800
went from there so

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
let's talk about awesome the word

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
awesome so that's it's used twice in

83
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
this quote that that inspired me

84
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,080
and

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,840
so i went and looked it up and said what

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,000
is you know what is um

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,480
awesome you know why is that term um

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
compelling

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,560
why does it apply in in this context

90
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,440
and

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,800
really it is it is about

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
um a comparative or

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,680
uh you know comparing something to the

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
other so this thing is awesome so it's

95
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,159
better than something else and and

96
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,440
that's sort of the crux of of the um

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,519
of the discussion today is

98
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,360
how do we how do we make comparison

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,200
about product features and um

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
and get them into the discussions so

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
that so that as we're looking at

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,239
developing and building a product

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
you know we're taking into account

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,599
the security features as first order

105
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,200
product features

106
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,319
so

107
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,159
um again i i

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,280
you know i come at this from the

109
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,959
viewpoint of

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,480
uh an agile agile delivery methodology

111
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,879
an azure practitioner a software

112
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,200
developer who does agile systems and so

113
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,560
very you know very much at the

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
fundamental process of what we're doing

115
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,519
is is devops or devsecops uh that

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
diagram at the lower left-hand side

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
there is the is the gartner diagram

118
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,600
about how to how to how to do devsecops

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,560
um

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,320
which i think is i i like the term

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
devsecops but really that gets kind of

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
complicated the more you start talking

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
about security the more that that that

124
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
you get um

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,080
you know complicated

126
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
um diagrams and complicated

127
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
guidance on how to how to move forward

128
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,320
and i

129
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
i prefer to think of of security much

130
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
more in a

131
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
straightforward simpler way

132
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
empowered teams

133
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,960
teams that are empowered to build your

134
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,880
enterprise software or to build your

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,120
product software should be empowered to

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
deliver the business value

137
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
that you want from that software and so

138
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
they need to be they need to have the

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
right set of tools and the right set of

140
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
capabilities and the right permissions

141
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,720
the right roles

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
to do that and they need to to go from

143
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,039
an idea of

144
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,479
you know here's here's some software

145
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,919
that's going to help us and get that

146
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,360
delivered either as a product or as as a

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
a running piece of software in your

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,160
organization so there's planning that

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,039
needs to be done build test deploy

150
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,600
monitor using continuous integration

151
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,919
tool sets um

152
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,199
using

153
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,440
uh

154
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
using devops using automation to deliver

155
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
this so that they're highly productive

156
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
and can focus on the the things that

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
that humans do best which is

158
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
being creative as opposed to the things

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
that machines do best which is which is

160
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,039
following the plan and deploying

161
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,240
software and monitoring hundreds of of

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
different uh

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,680
different software systems that are

164
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
deployed that build this pieces of

165
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,120
software that are deployed to build this

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,759
this holistic system so

167
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
empowered teams can

168
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,440
are

169
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,800
they have the capabilities and the

170
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,319
resources at their grasp whether it's

171
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,840
part of their team or other teams that

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
they can rely on

173
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,440
to to manage the entire process but

174
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,080
fundamentally the process is very simple

175
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
so

176
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
and this is you know the the diagram

177
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
here with the five stages is kind of

178
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,639
built on the

179
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
the uda loop that was developed by the

180
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,960
by the fighter pilots in the in the us

181
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
military and the the udo loop is observe

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
orient decide and act

183
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
and that simple process in a very

184
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,560
complex battlefield situation with a

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
multi-million dollar

186
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,520
100 million dollar airplane um

187
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,319
is this the the straightforward nature

188
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,120
of how to how to react and respond to

189
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
your environment and so software

190
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,639
developers need to do much the same

191
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,039
thing so i like the diagram that's on

192
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,560
the right which is a straightforward

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,039
simpler diagram anyhow

194
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,120
this is all about though delivering

195
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
business value in the simplest most

196
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,680
straightforward way possible and what we

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
want to do is to describe that value in

198
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
ways

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,039
that allow

200
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,280
development teams to make

201
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,479
decisions

202
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
that allow them to prioritize

203
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,639
security

204
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,800
requirements and so

205
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,039
there are many different frameworks that

206
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,360
that development teams will use to to

207
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,440
prioritize the features that they're

208
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
going to put in their product and we'll

209
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,960
talk about some of those that

210
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,840
that help teams

211
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
see that the security features that you

212
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,520
want to talk about the security aspects

213
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
of a system that as a security team you

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
want to see delivered

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,120
add value to their product and so there

216
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
these are are the roughly the four

217
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,199
categories that we're gonna we're going

218
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,639
to talk about

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,479
relative value of security features

220
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
versus other features

221
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
monetary methods

222
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,160
how to how to come up with a with a

223
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,680
a monetary

224
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
framework so the security features can

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
be prioritized in in and amongst the

226
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,479
other say revenue generating features of

227
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,440
a product um checklists of

228
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
different frameworks that you can use to

229
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,800
to say you know you've got to do all of

230
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
these things and then frameworks that

231
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,800
allow you to do modeling around

232
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
this the security

233
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,639
security features that you want how do

234
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
those how does the model of your system

235
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,400
um incorporate the security pieces that

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
that belong in this this particular

237
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,360
product

238
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
so we'll talk about how these how these

239
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,319
different methods of framing value help

240
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,080
you have a discussion with your with

241
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,399
your development teams to uh to make

242
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,599
sure that security is addressed properly

243
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
so

244
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,519
relative valuations is simply

245
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,958
taking a look at

246
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,880
at the product features and then looking

247
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,000
at

248
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
what has to be from a security

249
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,440
perspective what has to be in your

250
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
product and so this relative evaluations

251
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
tend to be i think more um well they're

252
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
relative so so there's a lot of give and

253
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,920
play here there's not a there's not a

254
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
set of

255
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
of uh there's not a fact-driven platform

256
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,720
that you can you can uh go with this is

257
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,440
much more a gut check kind of where does

258
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
where does security fit in gut check

259
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,240
wise compared to the feature to have

260
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
um you know a particular button do

261
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,200
something

262
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,440
uh in in the product

263
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
so

264
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,080
but but there's some things about

265
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,519
relative value that's that's kind of

266
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
helpful like you might have regulatory

267
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
mandates if you're building a system

268
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
that is that is dealing with credit

269
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
cards you've got

270
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,959
you know you can't you can't do this

271
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,359
unless

272
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,000
uh unless you're signing the the the

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,519
agreement with your card holder your

274
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
your card processing bank to uh you know

275
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
to do the following thing so there's

276
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,680
there's um you know contractual

277
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,440
agreements here there are regulatory

278
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,279
requirements if you're dealing with with

279
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,959
healthcare information

280
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,240
if you're dealing with financial

281
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
information

282
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
you uh these are these are mandates

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,760
right you can't you can't get away from

284
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,040
from addressing these things they're

285
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
important requirements which sort of you

286
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,839
know everybody knows using tls um and

287
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,320
up-to-date cypher suites i noticed that

288
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
you know the the browsers have been been

289
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,320
working diligently over the past two

290
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,120
years to really remove older older

291
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
crypto choices out of

292
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,079
your

293
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,920
um your manuals the big change from tls

294
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,279
1.1.1 to 1.2

295
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,120
is just removing

296
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
a lot of the cipher suite choices that

297
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,600
were available uh using oauth as a as a

298
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,760
strong way of doing the authentication

299
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
between systems enabling multi-factor

300
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
authentication in the systems i mean it

301
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
still surprises me that my bank thinks

302
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,519
that that multi-factor authentication is

303
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
somehow a text message to my cell phone

304
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
and and not using an actual multi-factor

305
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,040
app like a ubi key or some something

306
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,120
else um

307
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,959
encrypting encrypting data wherever you

308
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,720
can at rest in transit etc um setting up

309
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
session timeouts so

310
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,760
you know banks have

311
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
gotten fairly good at saying basically

312
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
if you're inactive for 15 minutes you

313
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
know you're you're

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
going to be logged out but there are

315
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,920
other places where where timeouts last

316
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,600
longer it's

317
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
you know for

318
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
for various reasons

319
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
um you know amazon will keep you logged

320
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,320
in for a very very long time because

321
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
it's in their best interest to make sure

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,279
that you can check out that on one click

323
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,200
right and whether it's you or somebody

324
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,680
who's wandered across your um logged in

325
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,839
session at the

326
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,160
library uh you know that's

327
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,279
you know what are the what are the

328
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,640
correct session timeouts what are the

329
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,839
correct session timeouts for your

330
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,880
product

331
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
and um you know there are lots of advice

332
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
and guidance that you can do here and

333
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
and and figure that out but again it's a

334
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,839
gut check for your product what makes

335
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,240
sense for for your product um and nice

336
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
to haves well so i threw an application

337
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
firewall um

338
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,639
as a nice to have but there's you know

339
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,760
some of you

340
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
on this call will say well but an

341
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
application firewall is a is a must-have

342
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,519
it's it's it's above important

343
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,760
requirements it's in a hard requirement

344
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
that may be the case but your product

345
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
team may feel differently that that

346
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,519
application firewall is somehow

347
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,680
preventing them from from doing work or

348
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
they don't have the time to to implement

349
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040
it and their gut says it's more

350
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,800
important to add a new feature that's

351
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,880
going to draw in more users than it is

352
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
to build an application firewall to

353
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
protect this product so having a

354
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,200
relative value discussion here is

355
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
probably the most difficult way to talk

356
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,959
to your to your development team so

357
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,000
uh

358
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,480
there are more factual driven ways to to

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,920
go have a team that allows this

360
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,120
discussion to be on on firmer ground

361
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
monetary evaluation is one way to do

362
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,959
this um

363
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
and so in particular

364
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
like what does it cost if something goes

365
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,279
wrong and so the the uh 2021 ibm pum is

366
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,360
is excellent for gathering this data and

367
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
and delivering it and sending it out

368
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,519
in terms of cost of the data breach i

369
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,160
don't know that their uh 2022 report is

370
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,839
available yet so these these figures

371
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,040
come through

372
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,399
the um

373
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,800
come from the 2021 report

374
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
uh and if you look in the speaker notes

375
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
you'll find the various pages that i've

376
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,560
that i've taken these particular amounts

377
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
from but when you go to your product

378
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,760
development team and you say look you're

379
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,800
spending

380
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,720
uh 10 million dollars to develop this

381
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,800
product or you're spending you know our

382
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
project budget is two million dollars

383
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
for this piece of enterprise software

384
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
and then you come with a piece of paper

385
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
that says hey look by the way

386
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
um if there's a breach here

387
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,079
this is what it's going to cost you um

388
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,560
and that number is you know twice the

389
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,519
size of the project that cost or it's

390
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,600
it's you know half the project cost for

391
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
this product um that can be a real

392
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
attention grabber right

393
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,920
getting you know the the

394
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,639
the full life value lifetime cost of a

395
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120
um of a of a user of your system they

396
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
might bring in

397
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,839
over the life of the system a hundred

398
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,399
thousand dollars in revenue um and the

399
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
cost of acquisition is is ten thousand

400
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
dollars to bring that customer in and if

401
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,320
you go tell them yeah if you add this

402
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
feature and it's broken by the way

403
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,279
the lifetime value of that customer is

404
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,760
gonna go from a hundred thousand dollars

405
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,639
to 2.4 million dollars in the negative

406
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,160
plus that hundred thousand dollars so

407
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,279
you're 4.14 million dollars in the hole

408
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,880
like that's a discussion

409
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
that your product teams your product

410
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,800
owners will listen to um

411
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,720
you know you can talk about the the

412
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
average cost of a of a lost record uh

413
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
and do some multiplication to show that

414
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,560
that a cost of a breach a cost of a

415
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
security of leaving out a security

416
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
feature not putting in that application

417
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,360
firewall that we talked about

418
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,839
could cost um a lot of money that

419
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,600
application firewall that might detect

420
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,560
an accidental sql injection attack

421
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
that's that's blocked by that firewall

422
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
that prevents a data breach that

423
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
prevents hundreds of thousands of

424
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,199
records of being released for 180 a

425
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,040
record right so this is a great way to

426
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
have this discussion um

427
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,680
however this sort of discussion can also

428
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,560
be abused in terms of the way that it's

429
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,440
done

430
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,399
um

431
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,720
i was listening to a security podcast

432
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,839
and one of the the cisos

433
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,079
was was basically saying

434
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,160
that anytime a product development

435
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,920
company a product development team

436
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,440
pushed back on a security feature that

437
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,279
her security team wanted to have

438
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,959
implemented in the product she would

439
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,760
just whip out the gdpr fine amount 20

440
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,560
million 20 million euros as the minimum

441
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,839
fine for

442
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,959
for whatever security feature and

443
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,480
while that's a really big number um it's

444
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,839
also a number

445
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,360
that is

446
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,839
impossible to sort of describe you know

447
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
to to put in in terms of the the product

448
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,320
feature and so because that number is so

449
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,720
far out of whack with say

450
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
a two million dollar project product to

451
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,759
put into the field because that 20

452
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,000
million dollar trumps it by by an order

453
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,639
of magnitude they just ignore it like

454
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
yeah sure you can say that but it

455
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,639
doesn't matter here

456
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,360
so

457
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
you don't you don't want to bring this

458
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
out and just basically have the security

459
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,759
team shut it down because they're you

460
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,959
know they're building a product they've

461
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,639
already been funded and now you come

462
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,800
along with this this big honking number

463
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
that they don't really care about and

464
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
see what what they do is they they

465
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,920
politely nod their heads and they wait

466
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,519
till you leave the conference room or

467
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,160
sign off the zoom call and

468
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
end of discussion they go back to doing

469
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
what they were doing anyway so it's

470
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
important to recognize how to have these

471
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
conversations and to scale these numbers

472
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,440
in ways that make sense to your

473
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
uh to your development team which

474
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,199
probably means talking more you know

475
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
building up more from the average you

476
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,839
know cost of a record loss

477
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,759
assume that the the number of records

478
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,440
lost might be a smaller number that's

479
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
fathomable by the group and then have

480
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,040
this discussion about ways to prevent

481
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
that you know you're concerned that if

482
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
you fire up a web application firewall

483
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,079
on amazon that's costing you

484
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,079
400 a month in addition to the other

485
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
costs on here but we can show that the

486
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,360
payback for that is

487
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,279
reducing the risk of the likelihood of

488
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
of um

489
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
of a of a breach

490
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,400
this way and therefore that 400 is a net

491
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,799
win and our organization can support you

492
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,720
on that by taking the time to build that

493
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,439
out so that's a better way to approach

494
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,000
this and use these numbers as a as a as

495
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
a

496
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
discussion point

497
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,079
um

498
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,480
there are checklists so this this you

499
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,440
know this gartner report um gartner is a

500
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,840
very well respected

501
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,919
organization uh giving lots of lots of

502
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,520
good advice to people

503
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
they have multiple lists on securities

504
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
so this um

505
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,960
12 things to get right i think was from

506
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,760
2019

507
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,840
a 2019 report there the the link is in

508
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,200
again in the speaker notes if you're

509
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
following along

510
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,120
in the uh in the presentation there um

511
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
this is common there are a number of

512
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,520
different um different sets of

513
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,400
checklists um from from this 12 things

514
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
which is kind of fathomable

515
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,360
to much longer lists like the uh the

516
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,400
nist sp 800 series of

517
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,440
of controls and i think sp

518
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,200
sp 863 has got like 106 controls of my

519
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,919
last check um you know going through a

520
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,160
list like that of 106 things that you

521
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
have to add to your product feature

522
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,360
when the product backlog may only have

523
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,840
you know they only have

524
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,799
you know

525
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,880
50 60 features in it and and then you

526
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,039
come in with a checklist here's the nist

527
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,600
sp 863 checklist here's you know 160 360

528
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,559
things you've got to add to your um

529
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,400
to your product before you can release

530
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,120
it is a great way again to to get

531
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,480
development teams to sort of nod their

532
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,600
heads and wait till you leave the room

533
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,799
and then they're going to go back and do

534
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,120
what they what they want to do

535
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,600
um but it but this is you know there's

536
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,080
some authority behind having the nist

537
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,039
give you a set of features the pci card

538
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,960
uh industry giving you a set of features

539
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
gartner telling you these are the things

540
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
that you need to do um there's there's

541
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,000
some authority behind there so it's not

542
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
just you in the room it's it's you know

543
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
important industry experts it's a great

544
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
way to to uh to have a discussion

545
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
but it's also some way you know you you

546
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,120
have to use that again in moderation and

547
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
make sure that you can use that to get

548
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,559
level set and get you know get the

549
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,559
attention of the team but then not shut

550
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
them down because because you're

551
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
carrying

552
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,720
uh too much weight

553
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,880
that they can't they can't uh they can't

554
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,400
carry it

555
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,280
um

556
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,600
so another approach that that i've used

557
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,679
in in the past that that was very

558
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,640
helpful

559
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,400
uh is the is the owasp um open sam

560
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
security model so you're familiar with

561
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,960
the os top 10 which is which is a great

562
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,480
place to start in terms of just sort of

563
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,919
remediating

564
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,520
starting with teams that haven't really

565
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,840
thought about security the os top 10 you

566
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,280
know here are things that you should do

567
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,039
have you thought about these things you

568
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,640
know do you know what sql injection is

569
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,000
does your tool you know does your

570
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,840
security life cycle your software

571
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,360
development life cycle does it take into

572
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
account how to check for and remediate

573
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,799
these top 10 things that's a great tool

574
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,080
the the lesser known product project at

575
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,480
osp is the open sams

576
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
model it's which stands for security

577
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,039
assurance and maturity

578
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,799
matrix model

579
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,640
so it goes through

580
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,360
it it's fairly complex

581
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,679
so in terms of again i think when you

582
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,320
each one of these boxes here each one of

583
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,960
the the um

584
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,640
the 12 sorry 15 boxes here has like four

585
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,960
or five different components on it so

586
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
you know 15 times five is is a pretty

587
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
big number pretty big laundry list of

588
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,799
maturity model processes that you want

589
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,240
in your in your software development

590
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,039
life cycle so it can be overwhelming

591
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,520
but at least it it's got a lot of you

592
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,720
know

593
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,320
good advice on things that you should be

594
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,200
doing

595
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,799
it also is a little bit more on telling

596
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,000
you what you should be doing and a

597
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
little less on

598
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
helpful advice around how to go about do

599
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
that um you know how do you do an

600
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
architectural assessment is is not

601
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,400
something that's in the mod in the open

602
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,640
sam model but it is telling you that

603
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,480
you've got to go do that so

604
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,760
um

605
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,159
this is where you can you can start off

606
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,919
with it with a development team and say

607
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
look here's a maturity model that will

608
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
get you farther along when you're

609
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,720
looking at a particular thing like

610
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,880
secure deployment or an architectural

611
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,400
assessment

612
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
come talk to us like if you don't know

613
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,840
how to do that architectural assessment

614
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,880
if you don't know how to do

615
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,919
that

616
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,600
piece come talk to us because we as

617
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
security professionals can guide you

618
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,000
through

619
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
that we'll we'll help you have that

620
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,400
discussion frame that up so that's um

621
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,159
this is a great tool even though it can

622
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,559
be can be daunting you can use it as a

623
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,280
way to again in moderation

624
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,559
um

625
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,360
talk talk to your teams and and uh start

626
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,520
that conversation and show them that you

627
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,600
can be the the collaborative

628
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,480
um

629
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,440
you know

630
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,840
uh consultant for

631
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,080
security and how to add security into

632
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,200
into their product so these are these

633
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,039
four four different methods of talking

634
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,520
about you know relative value checklists

635
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,480
and frameworks monetary

636
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
you know these are these are ways to to

637
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,320
to start that discussion

638
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,400
but ultimately you know teams teams that

639
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
deliver they have to be

640
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,000
they have to make sure that they're

641
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,720
empowered to deliver the the security

642
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,880
features that are necessary to to make a

643
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
product reliable

644
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,919
um

645
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,799
so

646
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,600
um again my my approach has been you

647
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,440
know the the best software is developed

648
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,400
by by empowered teams that can move fast

649
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,919
agile agile teams that understand the

650
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,159
business space that they're in and have

651
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,880
the uh the authority to solve their own

652
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
problems and move forward so they don't

653
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
you know when they run into a problem

654
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,520
they don't have to reach out to an

655
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,120
operations team they don't have to reach

656
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,320
out to

657
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,280
um other teams to

658
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,159
you know set up um certificates in their

659
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,280
software

660
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,039
they can do that themselves they can

661
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,520
they can set up you know tls they can

662
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
encrypt the data in their database on

663
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,159
their own

664
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,919
they can set up you know column level

665
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,840
encryption they can set up storage level

666
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,360
encryption and they've got the

667
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
capabilities in their environment to be

668
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
able to do that without having to wait

669
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
you know file a ticket wait three days

670
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,200
for for some operations team to get back

671
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,840
to them and then have you know three

672
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
one-hour meetings to discuss how this

673
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,679
gets implemented and then schedule it

674
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,600
for a release to be had in the in the

675
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,039
following month

676
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,080
um

677
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,559
that's um that's down the road right

678
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,400
they can

679
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,480
encrypt the data test it in their test

680
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,200
environment and later that day move that

681
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,559
same encryption

682
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,080
um checkbox

683
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,919
in you know whatever where however

684
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,000
they've enabled that feature deploy that

685
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,159
into production monitor it tomorrow and

686
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
make sure that that you know that

687
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
all of their workflows are still working

688
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,559
as process possible their their business

689
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
transactions are that are the same

690
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,400
they can collaborate with other teams

691
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,240
and this is important so they may not be

692
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,960
the

693
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,520
the be all and end all of say looking at

694
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,600
the how the um

695
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,320
how the azure sql server in their cloud

696
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,400
environment is configured but they can

697
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,679
go talk to their sre team or their cloud

698
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,559
dba team and and ask the question how do

699
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
we implement these this backup scheme

700
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,159
how do we ensure that that our um the

701
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,080
database is encrypted at rest and have a

702
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,799
consultative discussion with other teams

703
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,640
in their organization that understand

704
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,200
that particular area of their

705
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
infrastructure much more deeply

706
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,240
and by being able to do that they can

707
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,880
move fast and so when they recognize a

708
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,039
security need they can quickly

709
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,120
prioritize that and include that in

710
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,520
their product without having to

711
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,799
um

712
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,200
ask for permission or schedule it for

713
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,039
for a long time ahead they can they can

714
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,400
react to

715
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
uh to those security needs and so as you

716
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,400
as a uh as a security practitioner as

717
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,720
the security analyst that is

718
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
recommending things you can talk to

719
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,919
these teams

720
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,240
get the particular features prioritized

721
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
recognize that that the advice that you

722
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,600
bring will be prioritized and that's

723
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,840
okay because eventually

724
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,039
um

725
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,200
as as things become important enough

726
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,559
they will get addressed and not

727
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,000
everything has to be addressed at once

728
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,320
because you can't um you can't do

729
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,760
everything at once

730
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,159
so this is important to recognize that

731
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,000
cyber security is a business problem and

732
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,159
so um

733
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,279
this again is taken you know this idea

734
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,600
is taken from a book called um

735
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,720
fire doesn't innovate by um by kip boyle

736
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,400
who was the the chief information

737
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
security officer for uh for safeco

738
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,520
insurance

739
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,400
um

740
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,919
here in seattle

741
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,520
um so so kip uh i i you know what what

742
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,039
his point was

743
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,240
as as an insurer and as an insurer of

744
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,360
businesses

745
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,960
that that need business insurance and

746
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,159
they were looking at how do they do

747
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,080
cyber security insurance what he

748
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
realized was it was very easy them for

749
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
for them to

750
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,640
to sell insurance like fire insurance if

751
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,120
you've got a warehouse and

752
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,919
you are insuring that against fire like

753
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,440
fire is

754
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,039
um in

755
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
in this century is the same as it was in

756
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,880
the last century

757
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,960
pretty much not much has changed about

758
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
fire on the other hand

759
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
the cyber security threat that you've

760
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
got this year is totally different than

761
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,559
it was say just short two years ago

762
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,840
right the evolution if you read um

763
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,279
the if you go back and look at the

764
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,120
verizon data breach reports or you look

765
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
at at the um you know the various

766
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,760
security lineage security reports you

767
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
look at a microsoft uh trustworthy

768
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,640
computing report from from 10 years ago

769
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
and and now like the landscape is

770
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
totally different in terms of of how

771
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,159
that works and so what do you what his

772
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,520
suggestion is the cyber security

773
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
criminals

774
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,640
are innovating um you know very fast uh

775
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,400
month over month they're innovating in

776
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
the way they work and so if you're an

777
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,679
insurer in this business you you have a

778
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,559
very difficult problem but and and that

779
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,039
problem is a business problem it's not a

780
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,440
it's not a technology problem

781
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
it is a business problem and how do you

782
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
how do you solve that problem well

783
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,159
the way that you respond to an evolving

784
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,480
cyber security threat is through

785
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,159
development teams that can evolve their

786
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,120
product

787
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,600
to mitigate those threats and so you've

788
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,000
got to have an empowered team that's

789
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,559
empowered to to understand their threat

790
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,440
landscape and respond to it and so as

791
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
you do that what you're doing is a as a

792
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,760
cyber security person you're helping

793
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,880
that development team become much more

794
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,919
important uh much more capable and

795
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,360
therefore more valuable to your

796
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
organization and each of those

797
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,000
developers becomes more valuable

798
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,840
in terms of their their capabilities and

799
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,200
so this is a conversation that you can

800
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,360
have not telling them you have to do

801
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,760
these things because otherwise you know

802
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,000
there's grave concerns or whatever but

803
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,679
you can do these things you can make

804
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,279
your product more valuable and you can

805
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,440
become a better developer who brings

806
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,760
more value to the organization and

807
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,600
that's the way you want to frame this

808
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,919
conversation is around

809
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,039
bringing value by by building a more

810
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,320
trustworthy trustworthy product so the

811
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,240
the little pictograms there

812
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,200
um

813
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
is you know sort of a typical sort of

814
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,559
agile team where you've got a product

815
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,799
owner a development lead and several

816
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,240
developers and maybe some junior

817
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,080
developers and these are the this is the

818
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
team that's that's responsible for

819
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000
delivering a um

820
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,799
a product taking taking a product idea

821
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,520
and

822
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,200
building it and delivering that product

823
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,559
to the world and in the most

824
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,760
straightforward way as possible plan a

825
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,840
product increment build that increment

826
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,919
deliver that increment make sure that

827
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,399
product increment works as expected

828
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,480
build that minimum viable product make

829
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,000
sure that you're getting the value out

830
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,240
of that pivot that minimum viable

831
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,000
product into something that's different

832
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,120
than you imagined but is is

833
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,360
um your data shows that that's the the

834
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,880
features that the users are using to

835
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,240
enhance those features and make that

836
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,799
product you know follow what the users

837
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,520
are doing so you know you're you're

838
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,799
monitoring your business level

839
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,039
monitoring goes into your planning phase

840
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,279
and and so forth so this very simple

841
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,480
process

842
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
um security fits into this security

843
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,520
process because you can show that those

844
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
features add trustworthiness uh bring

845
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,039
more users to the product um and and

846
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,919
prevent various downsides and again

847
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,600
it's it's a business problem cyber

848
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
security becomes a business problem and

849
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,480
not just a checklist of things that

850
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,559
people have to do

851
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,679
so we talk a little bit about the

852
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,840
software supply chain there's also a

853
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,440
business value chain there are lots of

854
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
stakeholders that have um

855
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,279
that have

856
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,480
some

857
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,200
impact on your development team

858
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
that uh that they need to take advantage

859
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,919
of

860
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,600
starting with in the in the upper left

861
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
there your senior leadership team that

862
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,360
has certain expectations about what this

863
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,720
product is going to do and the the

864
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
revenue that product is going to bring

865
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,960
your business owners the your product

866
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,120
development so you're on the senior

867
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,960
leadership your cio your your vice

868
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,600
presidents your directors um you've got

869
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
business owners your your product

870
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,399
development teams your product

871
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,080
development owners your business

872
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,240
analysts your project managers they all

873
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,960
have some say so your users

874
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,600
have a significant contribution towards

875
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,159
the the types of business value you want

876
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,000
to deliver in this product

877
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,640
um your sre and operations teams that

878
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,480
that help your

879
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,200
um

880
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,799
your development team

881
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,559
deliver the value help them monitor and

882
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,720
make sure that that value works right so

883
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,799
you've got your your sre person your

884
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,200
tier one responder your operations

885
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
personnel

886
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,640
all of which are stakeholders and making

887
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,320
sure that that um

888
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,159
you know your system is is not um is not

889
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,200
waking them up in the middle of the

890
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
night

891
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
not over consuming resources and costing

892
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,600
more than

893
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,440
than the value etc

894
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,039
that it's a manageable product then

895
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,480
you've got information security so

896
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,559
you're just one of the stakeholders your

897
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,559
team is just one of the stakeholders

898
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,279
that's involved in delivering helping

899
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,279
this product team this development team

900
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,880
deliver value

901
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,399
you've got your your cyber security

902
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,399
analyst your pen tester and your

903
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,320
compliance people that that have those

904
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,039
you know industry regulations or or

905
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,200
governmental regulations in order to to

906
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,960
deliver this product

907
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,559
so all of these people have

908
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,679
conversations and given that you're as

909
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,519
information security competing with

910
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,600
these others you need to frame

911
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,960
what the way that you have that

912
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,360
conversation um

913
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
to ways that are receptive and being

914
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,279
responding to the things that that

915
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,399
organization

916
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,159
the the development team is being pushed

917
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,000
and pulled on and how you can bring

918
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,159
value so that you can

919
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,320
essentially lever

920
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,559
reduce the complexity of their life

921
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,039
reduce the pressures on them

922
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,600
be helpful in ways that allow them to uh

923
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,159
to get their work done better faster

924
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,360
um so by bringing automation by bringing

925
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,000
um helping them with with problems that

926
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
they can't solve themselves and helping

927
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,039
them solve those problems you become a

928
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,519
partner with this team and you frame

929
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,399
things um in ways that they can consume

930
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
the information and the support that

931
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,240
you're bringing them

932
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,519
and that's the important part is

933
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,440
figuring out how how can they consume

934
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,919
the message that you want to receive uh

935
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,480
the message you want them to receive

936
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,000
so my recommendation is that

937
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,080
you know systems that are that are built

938
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,320
and delivered are delivered

939
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,159
iteratively like if you look at the

940
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,480
growth of just just look at aws i mean

941
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,120
it started out as very few features and

942
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,360
and they continued to iterate on the

943
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,399
features that that

944
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,360
that their customers were buying um

945
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,200
azure started out as features that were

946
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
consumed internally in microsoft and

947
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,799
that eventually were released to to the

948
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,200
outside world originally it was really

949
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,120
intended to be a platform as a service

950
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,000
using just uh microsoft the platform of

951
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,480
microsoft products like.net

952
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,399
delivered in platform as a service and

953
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,320
now it's become a fully featured you

954
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,640
know um software as a service platform

955
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,120
as a service and and um in

956
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,039
infrastructure as a service and and

957
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,320
they've incremented on that um over the

958
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,240
you know decade or so that they've been

959
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,039
delivering the azure services so again

960
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,640
taking an incremental approach starting

961
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,720
with things that are most consumable by

962
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,039
by your development team um and getting

963
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,640
that in the current iteration getting

964
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,200
that in the the next thing that that

965
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,159
this team is going to going to release

966
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,600
um

967
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
and and not try to give them the entire

968
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,080
checklist you know in your next release

969
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,600
you have to deal with with everything

970
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,960
that's in sp 863 here are you know 106

971
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
security controls that have to be built

972
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,239
into the next release of your system

973
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,560
that's a great way to to stop all all

974
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,918
project work right that's not going to

975
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,879
happen um for another 18 months and so

976
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,320
whatever whatever product they're

977
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,359
building

978
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,520
um is going to lose an 18-month head

979
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,879
start on on the competition so figuring

980
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,599
out

981
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,520
which ones of those requests are most

982
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,800
important which one of those security

983
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,399
controls are most important and get that

984
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,960
in the next iteration and get that that

985
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
delivered and even helping your team

986
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,440
build some of the automation that's

987
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,399
needed the the devops automation

988
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,399
taking that on and working with your

989
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,399
your sre team or working with the

990
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,079
developer that's really interested in

991
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,440
installing that

992
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,960
that um jenkins server or maybe some

993
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,918
other better qual higher quality um

994
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,918
devops server

995
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,119
um

996
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,280
and but but is interested in that we'll

997
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,200
have a conversation with you get that

998
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,599
built into the next iteration

999
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,400
and you can work your way as you as as

1000
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
your team iterates on smaller wins

1001
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,720
around security they become more and

1002
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,560
more capable they become more capable

1003
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,000
take on bigger wins around um

1004
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,119
around deployments and around adding

1005
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,040
bigger features like doing container

1006
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,359
scanning doing a full thread assessment

1007
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,560
or a risk model of of their their system

1008
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,359
um is a great way to uh

1009
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,480
you know after they've they've had um

1010
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,320
you've developed a working relationship

1011
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,920
on on small

1012
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,760
features that they can implement now you

1013
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,240
can begin to expand that conversation

1014
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
into broader topics and bring them into

1015
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,200
the fold number one they're in a in a

1016
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,720
position to better have that

1017
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
conversation with you because they

1018
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,280
understand

1019
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
that they can deliver security features

1020
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,240
and two they understand having delivered

1021
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,040
some

1022
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
what what remains to be done they begin

1023
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,040
to get um

1024
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,160
uh a good sense of of what the security

1025
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,240
landscape looks like and therefore we'll

1026
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,480
have a broader conversation with you and

1027
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,160
we'll start start having that

1028
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
conversation help you know bringing you

1029
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,440
to the table to to help them evaluate

1030
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,079
what security feature uh is next

1031
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,599
should we be doing should we be

1032
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,520
implementing a software supply chain

1033
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
system or should we be implementing

1034
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,240
oauth on the front end which which one

1035
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,680
of those things is more important you

1036
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,560
guys can help them evaluate that

1037
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,599
through through a consultative approach

1038
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,720
so and what this boils down to is

1039
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,560
that a system is not going to be used if

1040
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,400
it's not trustworthy

1041
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,480
and so by

1042
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,119
helping your development teams build

1043
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,200
trust into the system

1044
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,880
you are helping that development team

1045
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,800
build a system that people will use um

1046
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,880
and i know for for for many years i

1047
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,400
worked in you know various enterprise um

1048
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,920
it shops and all of their uh development

1049
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,359
and actually

1050
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,920
so even working on a project now that

1051
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,240
that kicked off last month and and the

1052
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,320
um

1053
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,160
the

1054
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,720
the project manager brought out the you

1055
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,200
know the book that said okay

1056
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,800
here are the non-functional requirements

1057
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,880
that we want to add to your system

1058
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,640
and and i'm like

1059
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,920
i'm sorry

1060
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,839
those are all functional requirements

1061
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,359
what do you mean that these things are

1062
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,800
are non-functional

1063
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,400
um we're not going to get to them all at

1064
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,680
once and we're

1065
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,920
we're probably going to release well

1066
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,200
before we've addressed everything on

1067
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,839
that list but but trust me they're

1068
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,760
they're important they're functional and

1069
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,680
we will get to them but maybe not in the

1070
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,359
order that you think and certainly not

1071
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
in a big waterfall fashion

1072
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,960
um that was there before so um don't

1073
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
don't you know help your teams

1074
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,320
understand that

1075
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,160
or let me put this

1076
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,839
in a in a different way when you bring a

1077
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,079
big checklist when you when you bring a

1078
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,359
big honking

1079
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,359
um scary number

1080
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,680
you shut down the conversation

1081
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,280
um when you call these things

1082
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,960
non-functional requirements that must be

1083
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,839
addressed like you've you've sort of

1084
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,079
it's a contradiction in terms these are

1085
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,160
functional requirements and if you frame

1086
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
the conversation as as here's everything

1087
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,000
that you've got to do before we you can

1088
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,880
release you end up uh essentially

1089
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,480
throwing down a gauntlet and you and you

1090
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,960
put yourself in an adversarial position

1091
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,680
and and that's uh that shuts down the

1092
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,760
conversation you need to come in a way

1093
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,200
where you're talking about application

1094
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,560
trust the next the next security uh

1095
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,400
minimum viable security increment that

1096
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,839
you can put in your product that will

1097
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,160
make this product better right and let

1098
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,280
the team decide and work with them in in

1099
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,359
developing a rubric their own rubric and

1100
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,720
framework for

1101
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,920
how do you

1102
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
um

1103
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,440
how do you

1104
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,359
decide when

1105
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,200
you know you've got

1106
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,359
enough security value

1107
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,599
for your next release and that may not

1108
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,200
be every bit of security value you'd

1109
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,320
like to see them done but if it's better

1110
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,079
better is

1111
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,800
um is a win and

1112
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,079
if you

1113
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,720
use you know perfection it's it's the

1114
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,800
enemy of of getting a product out the

1115
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,839
door

1116
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,720
so

1117
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,800
you know you need to

1118
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,320
construct your

1119
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,079
discussion in a way that that is

1120
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,160
incremental and consumable

1121
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,280
right

1122
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,480
so sort of in summary um

1123
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,560
and there's still a little bit more down

1124
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,240
here is don't boil the ocean so working

1125
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,599
back up so

1126
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,839
you know be prepared to work iteratively

1127
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,280
you can't you can't come with a giant

1128
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,440
checklist um

1129
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,680
find the developer that's interested in

1130
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
security and work with them and help

1131
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,000
them build a beachhead and then broaden

1132
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
that that beachhead of security in the

1133
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
team as they become more capable they'll

1134
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,040
see more value and this is something

1135
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,000
that builds over time um

1136
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,240
post security requirements as product

1137
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,720
requirements as as

1138
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640
product features that bring value so

1139
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,800
think about ways of of not describing

1140
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,839
features

1141
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,680
security features as things that that

1142
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,560
are

1143
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,760
net negative or or the sort of domicles

1144
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,440
that's hanging over the development

1145
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,800
group that you can't do anything until

1146
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,280
you solve this problem but more as

1147
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,960
here's way to bring more value to your

1148
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,880
product and here's how we can describe

1149
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,160
those those that that value

1150
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,920
and and help empower your development

1151
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,160
teams to to deliver

1152
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,079
so i worked with uh

1153
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,119
with a gaming company

1154
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,560
um many years back in terms of helping

1155
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,720
them develop secure

1156
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,240
conversations between the various

1157
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,079
different components of their system and

1158
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:44,800
so

1159
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,240
you know i i

1160
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,079
showed them

1161
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,440
where where there were going to be

1162
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,680
problems if the code if the conversation

1163
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,280
was insecure and how that could be

1164
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,359
exploited showed them how to secure that

1165
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,040
conversation in the way that you know

1166
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,240
how to use um

1167
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,000
cryptography to secure these

1168
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,440
conversations between two different

1169
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,119
components and then wrote some of the

1170
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,280
code that helped them to do that

1171
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,160
and

1172
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,760
then went on to do some other work with

1173
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,680
that team and was very proud of the fact

1174
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,400
that i was um added to an email thread

1175
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,440
where somebody had said oh look

1176
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,720
we need to have these other two

1177
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,119
components talk to each other and

1178
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,040
we know how to do that so let's add this

1179
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,119
security piece just like we did over

1180
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,319
here

1181
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,400
and they had are actually

1182
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,599
i was added to the end of that

1183
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,960
conversation

1184
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,040
after it had been released and they were

1185
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,359
all done with it and it worked correctly

1186
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,440
um i got added to that thread and i

1187
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,200
thought well there's there's my job

1188
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,079
right um i showed them how to do it and

1189
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,000
now they've done it on their own without

1190
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,160
including me they understand the value

1191
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,240
of security they understand how to

1192
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,839
implement that security so now they're

1193
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,640
capable of doing it as well and you know

1194
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,720
hey that was a huge success so if you

1195
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,560
can if you can have the conversation the

1196
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,040
way that leads the teams to better you

1197
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,960
know to just include that security on

1198
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,880
their own they recognize the problem

1199
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,760
they can solve the problem themselves um

1200
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,359
you've you've

1201
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,680
had a big win and recognize also too

1202
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,040
that like

1203
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
prior to them

1204
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,640
having uh

1205
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
you know having recognized this and

1206
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,160
implemented this feature they had a

1207
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,599
security hole

1208
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,040
um

1209
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,359
and you know you could live with that a

1210
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,280
little bit for a while because they did

1211
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,200
have the capability and they recognize

1212
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,960
it and so lots of products you know you

1213
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,359
in everything right so

1214
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,200
you look at most of the zero days and

1215
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,960
you know the the the big things that

1216
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,760
have occurred in in linux where you know

1217
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,560
the the big problem with

1218
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,359
with um open ssl that was that was last

1219
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,200
year the problem with heartbleed like

1220
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
you look at all of these things they're

1221
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,000
long-standing issues that have been in

1222
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,040
the product

1223
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,000
um

1224
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,440
that are kind of waiting around for

1225
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,240
people to find them don't um

1226
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
you're you know if

1227
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,960
if we had waited 20 years to release

1228
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,720
linux because we hadn't found and fixed

1229
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,119
all the zero days in linux you know

1230
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,960
linux wouldn't be here so

1231
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,480
um

1232
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,920
you still need to get the product out

1233
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,960
get and get feedback um on it so help

1234
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,319
your teams get the product out the door

1235
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,160
a couple of things here so we talked

1236
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,200
about devops devsecops so accelerate is

1237
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,079
is

1238
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,319
a great book for

1239
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,640
how to get teams empowered to deliver

1240
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,960
how to use automation

1241
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,880
the the thing about accelerate is it

1242
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,839
talks again a lot of these these

1243
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,960
tell you

1244
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,720
what you should do without really

1245
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,119
telling you how to do that so

1246
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,640
the the thing on the right there the

1247
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,800
devops efficiency matrix

1248
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,599
is

1249
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,920
give some guidance in terms of how to

1250
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,119
recognize

1251
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,440
whether your your devops your devsecops

1252
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,720
environment is

1253
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,280
efficient or inefficient and the sorts

1254
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,480
of things

1255
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,079
how you go about improving your

1256
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,319
efficiency so the idea is to build a

1257
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,920
simpler framework

1258
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,079
that gives you more structured advice on

1259
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,160
on how to go do that but accelerate is a

1260
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,640
great book for reading um as well as the

1261
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,560
other things that uh the last author

1262
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,440
there gene gene kim has written

1263
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,839
but this book is a great great um

1264
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,359
discussion of the capabilities that you

1265
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,599
need to be able to deliver software

1266
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,160
um the other book which i i don't think

1267
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,400
you know it's it's been around for

1268
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,599
uh a decade or more now based on the the

1269
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,800
microsoft

1270
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,880
secure development life cycle threat

1271
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,839
modeling

1272
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,599
helping your teams you know this is not

1273
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,119
a book that i think the information

1274
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,560
security teams need to read this is a

1275
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,400
book that that development teams need to

1276
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,280
read and understand how to do

1277
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,760
you know threat modeling how to build

1278
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,240
data flow diagrams that show where where

1279
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,480
data is moving in your system

1280
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,160
and where those interfaces are in that

1281
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,400
data flow diagram and then how to secure

1282
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,800
those interfaces this is a great book

1283
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,839
for development teams to uh

1284
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,599
to to work with

1285
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,599
um so working with your development

1286
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,599
teams introducing them to this model

1287
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,839
introducing them to the to the stride

1288
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,640
methodology for evaluating helps them

1289
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,118
gives them a

1290
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,680
it gives them the capability to make

1291
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,520
value-based judgments on the security

1292
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,880
features that they need to add in the

1293
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,560
next product increment

1294
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,280
so

1295
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,680
this is still an excellent book and an

1296
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,359
excellent approach

1297
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,200
even if possibly some of the terminology

1298
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,960
and so forth is more dated for for a

1299
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,079
decade ago this is still correct

1300
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,040
um

1301
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,800
and so thank you for

1302
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800

chat on the the speaker's stream channel

1305
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,880
i'll be around for a while um

1306
