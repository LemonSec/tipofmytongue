1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,480
hi everyone

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,880
so for today we will be talking about

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,720
the trifecta of email authentication

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,880
but before we start i just want to

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,599
introduce myself

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,560
my name is denise and i am currently

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,560
living in the philippines

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,400
and i've been in cyber security for

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
almost a year now i think the first

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
year would be

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
my anniversary in cyber is next month if

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,840
i can recall that right

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,880
so

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
quick background on how i got in cyber

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,719
security

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,960
first year of pandemic i was listening

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
to this podcast on spotify

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,039
it's called darknet diaries i think

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,840
most of you know about it

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,160
and

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,840
after hearing all the episodes one

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
episode stuck with me which is the

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,520
shamoon by

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
chris kobecka

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,400
and i got really inspired with her story

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,890
and

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,200
[Music]

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,520
after that i got in touch with her and

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,200
asked her

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
the things i should do

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,159
for me to be come to be in cyber

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,640
security then i took those steps

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,439
and

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
i took different courses especially

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
online and the tutorials because there's

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,720
a lot of videos tutorials that you can

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,079
find that are related to cyber security

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,400
so i took those those three

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,360
free

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,479
videos

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,400
and

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,720
after a year i

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,360
i was still studying and

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,320
year 2021 i

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
got a job in cyber so someone took a

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
chance on me so if

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
you are

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,799
you are trying to get into cyber do not

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,360
give up because

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
this field is really interesting and

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,960
sometimes it gets really frustrating

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
but

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
again don't give up i think i had 200

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
job applications

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
until one

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,440
one company or one person said okay

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
let's get you in

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,239
but before cybersecurity i was working

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,599
in

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,680
software testing

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
so i worked there for i think seven to

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
eight years

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
that's right

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
then

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
moved to cyber security

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,280
so

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
and another

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,680
things about me so i'm a spokesperson of

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
my dog so no one in my in our family is

70
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
the spokesperson it's only me and no one

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,879
else

72
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,720
and a huge fan of drinking water

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,160
all right okay let's get to the agenda

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
so for today we will be talking about

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,640
spf dkim and dmarc

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
why they matter and the online resources

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,640
you can use to check if these three

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,319
things are

79
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,599
implemented in your company

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,040
first

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,720
we will start

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,120
with spf

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
so spf

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,920
is sender policy framework

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,560
spf was made

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,519
to avoid forgery of sender's information

87
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
or sender address

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
it's at the extra record that you

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,239
publish in your dns server

90
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,879
it also lets you configure

91
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,280
ip addresses or third-party services

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
that can send in your behalf

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,280
it lets you protect from cyber criminals

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,159
trying to spoof your domain

95
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,799
and if you have this in place

96
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,400
it will lessen

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,239
it will likely lessen your email to be

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,200
marked as a spam

99
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,360
so how does spf work

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
for example here

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
i have

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
dave's company

103
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,879
so what divs company

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,959
i have published my spf record

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,519
in my dns server

106
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,238
so

107
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,600
example someone sends an email

108
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
outside my organization and the

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
recipient mail server which will receive

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
that email

111
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,960
and will perform a

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
a check if

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
this

114
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
spf record matches the one that i

115
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,639
that i publish in my dns server

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,199
if it matches

117
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,919
the recipient will receive the email

118
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,040
and if it fails what happens if it fails

119
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,320
so

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
it

121
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,800
it will

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
fall in spam

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
or it will be rejected

124
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,159
so what does spf look like

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
so spf record looks like this

126
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
so this is a text record again the x

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,800
record that you publish in your dns

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
server

129
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,880
so we have here the vs equals to spf 1

130
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
this is the standard one

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,000
and you cannot change this or else it

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
won't

133
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,560
be it won't be red

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,039
this is what everyone uses

135
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,639
and

136
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,039
the ip4 is the list of ip addresses

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,880
again that can send in behalf of your

138
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
domain

139
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,639
and the third party

140
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,840
services

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
it could be the

142
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,360
third

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,320
marketing services that your company

144
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
use

145
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,199
and the dash already

146
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,280
means reject all emails that do not

147
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
match the spf record

148
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,479
so

149
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,720
there are other mechanisms when it comes

150
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,000
to spf

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,759
we'll discuss it in a bit

152
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
so here are the different mechanisms

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,919
that

154
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,120
you can

155
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
use for your spf

156
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,479
we have here that

157
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,360
pass

158
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
soft feel and heart fail

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
and

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
the soft fail just means

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
suspicious emails are not really

162
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,840
rejected but

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
please put it in parenting or spam

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,840
folder

165
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
and the heart fail again this is the

166
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,800
reject this is the one that we discussed

167
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,479
the previous slide

168
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,639
so this means reject all emails that are

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,199
not authorized to send in

170
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,880
my organization's behalf

171
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
and the past just means accept all

172
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
emails even if that

173
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,479
post is not allowed to send

174
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,880
in behalf of us so i do not really

175
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,160
recommend this at all because you're

176
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
just letting

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,880
everyone to

178
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,400
to pretend to be

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
so that's for spf

180
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
next one we have is the dkm

181
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,960
so

182
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,080
dkim or dkim

183
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,120
domain case identified me

184
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,080
so this method also allows us to know if

185
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
the message was altered during transit

186
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,160
so

187
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
we all know in cyber security we have

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,599
the cia triad

189
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,120
we have the

190
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
confidentiality

191
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
integrity and availability

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,479
so domain keys identified near

193
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,199
fulfills the integrity part of the cia

194
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,080
triad so it makes sure that the data has

195
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,120
not been

196
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,039
tampered are altered during transit

197
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,199
and

198
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,360
during if it's stored

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
okay

200
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,199
so dkim allows you to add a dikem

201
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,919
signature to your header

202
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
so

203
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,560
how does taking work

204
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
it works like this

205
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,199
so for example

206
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,440
when you send an email

207
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
the server generates a hash encrypted

208
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,560
with a private key and a corresponding

209
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
public key that is published in your dns

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,840
server

211
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
so the private key is only available and

212
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
accessible to you

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
and

214
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
once the recipient mail server receives

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,919
that email

216
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,479
the recipient mail server will look up

217
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,320
the sender's public key that you pop

218
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
again that you publish in your then a

219
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,679
server

220
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,279
and

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
the recipient mail server will verify if

222
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,200
it matches

223
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
the one that you publish

224
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
once it does it will use that key to

225
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,959
decrypt

226
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,720
to decrypt the signature

227
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
and lastly the receiving mail server

228
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
will generate a hash based from the

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,839
email received

230
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,480
and will compare if that two has hashes

231
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,440
much

232
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
so you have the

233
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,880
decrypted hash and the freshly generated

234
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,080
hash from the email that you receive

235
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,640
so you have two things here for the game

236
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,080
you verify that they are who they say

237
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
they are

238
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
and you have verified that the message

239
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
or the email was not altered during

240
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,120
transit

241
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,560
okay

242
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,519
so

243
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
what does they can look like

244
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,000
they came looks like this

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,839
these are the

246
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,200
required tags for deakin signature

247
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,839
but there are also other optional tags

248
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,959
you can use

249
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,160
when

250
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
you generate or when you include the

251
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
game signature to your

252
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
organization

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,320
so we have here these equals to one this

254
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
is always the version

255
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
so again once you

256
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,760
once you change this it won't be red

257
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
and the a

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,040
means the

259
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,640
algorithm used to generate the signature

260
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,600
so

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,959
most

262
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
organizations

263
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
use this

264
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,440
algorithm the rsa shadow 56

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,720
and

266
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,839
the d just means the domain of the

267
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,800
sender and the s is the

268
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
selector record name to locate the

269
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,839
public key in the dns

270
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,320
and the age this is the header fields

271
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,959
the list of header fields

272
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,959
and the b the ph is the body hush

273
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,600
and the beast the

274
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
this is the actual signature of the

275
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,760
content for both headers and body so

276
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,440
for the deacon signature this is the

277
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,079
heart of it

278
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,560
all right so we'll proceed to

279
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,518
to the d mark

280
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
what is the mark

281
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
so dmarc is domain based message

282
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,040
authentication

283
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,760
reporting and conformance

284
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
so

285
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
dmarc policy started up appearing in the

286
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
year of 2012.

287
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
and it instructs the receiving mail

288
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,760
server how they should process

289
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
the emails from that domain should they

290
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,480
fail the spf and the team

291
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,800
or if spf and d team are not aligned

292
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,680
and

293
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
the email will undergo depending on the

294
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,279
demark policy that you have set

295
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,160
so later we will discuss the policies

296
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
for demar

297
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,959
and

298
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,600
how they can fit in your organization

299
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
so dmarc also

300
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,320
has reports including on how your domain

301
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
is being used

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,560
this also includes reports from

303
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,920
malicious actors or cyber criminals

304
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
pretending to be you so these reports

305
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,639
are generated every day

306
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,440
you can use them to

307
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,399
again monitor how your domain is doing

308
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,399
and from there you can

309
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,680
check

310
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
and

311
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,600
set different policies that can suit

312
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,720
your

313
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,000
your organization

314
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,959
the next slide

315
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
all right for this slide

316
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,959
so

317
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,079
dmarc checks if the vegan signature

318
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,880
or spf record are aligned

319
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
and if they match

320
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
what you have published

321
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
so for example

322
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
spf record is failing

323
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,399
but the deacon signature is passed

324
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,519
what happens there so it depends on your

325
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
organization if

326
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
you want them quarantined

327
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,880
none or reject so these are the policies

328
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
for

329
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,079
for

330
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,479
dmarc

331
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,920
so if they match so if they are all

332
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,200
aligned

333
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,279
the recipient will receive the indian

334
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,680
and if not again the receiving mail

335
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,320
server will decide what to do based on

336
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,160
the demark policy that you have set

337
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,120
so the mark policy looks like this

338
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,760
v is the version again this is what

339
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
everyone uses this is the only version i

340
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,560
think for now

341
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,199
and here this is the policy so you have

342
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,639
quarantine

343
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
none and reject

344
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,279
so for quarantine

345
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,839
if the dmarc authentication fails it

346
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,760
tells the receiving mail server to

347
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,880
parenting the email

348
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
no action taken the email the email will

349
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,399
still be delivered

350
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,920
and

351
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,360
it depends on how the

352
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,639
receiving

353
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
mail server

354
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,360
filters this for example you don't have

355
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,240
you do not have dmarc policy in place

356
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,720
it is up to the mailbox providers on

357
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,800
what they should do it depends on their

358
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
filters

359
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,560
and project

360
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,000
reject unauthorized emails

361
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and the pct here is this is the

362
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,360
percentage

363
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,720
you can set it to either 25

364
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,120
50 or 100

365
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,279
so

366
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
percentage is 100

367
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
here in these policies

368
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,480
100 percent

369
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,760
quarantined

370
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
none and reject

371
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
and rua this is where the

372
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,399
reports are being sent

373
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,560
so this is again

374
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,399
so you'll see how

375
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,279
your

376
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,959
domain is being used

377
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,079
so i think

378
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,880
as of now you are wondering if your

379
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,440
organization has this in place

380
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
or if your organization have set all

381
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,920
these three things

382
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,839
and if not we'll discuss the different

383
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,600
tools checker

384
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,519
you can use

385
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,839
so that you can let your security team

386
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,320
know that hey we do not

387
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
hating we do not use this

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,199
we do not have this in place we do not

389
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,160
have spf record in place the game and

390
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,680
the mark

391
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,399
and let them know what are the

392
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,880
what will happen if we do not have this

393
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,959
in place

394
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,519
so

395
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,639
i have

396
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,920
here the

397
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,160
three tools i use

398
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,839
for spf record generator

399
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,720
and the dkm record generator

400
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,800
so for example i use the mx toolbox for

401
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
spf record lookup

402
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,800
example here i have the i have

403
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,959
google.com i check the google.com and

404
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,639
google has

405
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,279
the spf in place but

406
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,399
it's in software

407
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,519
next this is the spf record generator

408
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,079
again you can let your

409
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,040
security team know about this

410
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,639
or you can check

411
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,399
after this slide

412
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,079
or after this presentation if your

413
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,519
domain has the same base

414
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,199
and

415
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,440
this is the dkm

416
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,199
record generator

417
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,320
you can use this for generating atticum

418
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,600
signature

419
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,320
for your organization you can also use

420
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,519
this for

421
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,880
the kim look up

422
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
and

423
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
here we have the

424
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,359
dmarc record generator

425
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,520
so you just include the domain or

426
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,119
hostname

427
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,880
and you can check

428
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,359
the dmarc record

429
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,119
another good thing about

430
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,240
mx toolbox is they

431
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,280
they

432
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
instruct you on how to create a demarc

433
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
record so they have different set of

434
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,120
questions here

435
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
how do you how do you want mail that

436
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,840
fails the mark to be treated by

437
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,480
recipient this is again the parenting

438
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,120
object it depends again on your

439
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,600
organization

440
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,400
and

441
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,200
the

442
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,280
email addresses should aggregate the

443
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,000
americas report sent to

444
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,799
and this is again the reports that's

445
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,720
being generated every day

446
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
and

447
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
here the suggestion of mx toolbox

448
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,640
so

449
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,840
they suggest on what you should

450
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,240
what you can include in your

451
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,679
dmarc

452
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,640
so

453
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,960
google's current record is this one so

454
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,200
reject

455
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
and

456
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
again you can use this

457
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,919
for your organization hopefully

458
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,360
you can

459
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
tell your security team that

460
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,799
hey we have these different tools

461
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,120
that we can use for

462
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,000
for our organization

463
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,440
to have our email from preventing of

464
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,400
being spoofed

465
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,880
all right

466
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,200
okay i think that's it

467
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
so

468
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,000
you can contact me here and thank you

469
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
everyone for watching

470
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,200
this quick presentation

471
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,679
i hope you learned something from this

472
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,559
talk

473
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,600
and

474
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,640
how these three methods work together

475
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
to combat spoofing and protecting your

476
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
domain

477
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,400
you can contact me here if you have

478
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
questions

479
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,760
and here are the online resources i have

480
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
use

481
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,520
so you can

482
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,679
screenshot this slide and use this

483
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
you
