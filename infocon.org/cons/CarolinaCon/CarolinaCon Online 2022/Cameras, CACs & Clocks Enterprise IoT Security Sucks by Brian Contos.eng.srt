1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
hey everybody i'm brian cantos i'm the

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,480
chief security officer with phosphorus

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,960
cyber security uh today's presentation

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,280
is cameras cacs and clocks enterprise

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,240
iot security sucks uh this is a story of

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,759
two million interrogated iot devices so

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,359
let's just jump right in

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,439
a little bit about my background i've

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,320
been in cyber for about 25 years i've

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
worked all over the world mostly

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,680
pre-covered

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,439
prior to phosphorus

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,199
i started my career with disa then later

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,480
bell labs

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,920
and then just started building startup

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,040
companies

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,399
arcsight

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,040
riptech imperva solera networks and a

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,120
few others i sit on a couple different

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440
boards i've written some books in fact

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,160
in 2007 i wrote a book with the former

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,640
director of the nsa bill kroll uh which

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
was focused particularly on physical and

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
logical security convergence which took

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,640
iot sort of into uh consideration a

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,960
little bit before its day however but

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,399
certainly some of the tenants of that

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,680
research fall into what we're going to

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,239
be talking about today

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,520
so before we start a little bit of

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
background on the research so we started

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
this in 2017 and it's actually still

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920
ongoing and we've looked at millions and

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,159
millions of production customer

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,479
enterprise iot devices so this isn't in

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,479
a lab environment these are actually

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,119
real enterprise iot devices running in

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,560
operation today

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
most of these customers are what you'd

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,159
consider fortune 500 global 2000

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
government agencies

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
and and what we're focusing on again is

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,799
enterprise iot it's not consumer iot

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,560
which you might think of as a ring

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
doorbell aroma vacuum cleaner and alexa

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,439
these types of cloud managed iot devices

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,320
but

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,960
the term iot is very expansive

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,560
you can incorporate industrial iot ot

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,439
devices like scada and weapon systems

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,000
battlefield of things as well industry

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
4.0 smart buildings smart cities and so

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,479
many other things

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
for the sake of this presentation we

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,719
really just want to focus on those

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,280
iot devices that you commonly find in

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
the enterprises

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,520
uh in addition to this

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,920
we're not going to be focusing on uh

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
taking a device ripping apart the

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,080
hardware pulling out an oscilloscope you

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,920
know looking at the chips dissecting the

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,680
firmware for vulnerabilities that's

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,879
valuable there's a lot of great

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,879
presentations on that but this is really

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,360
about enterprise operations of iot

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
devices

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
so what are we going to cover i'm going

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,720
to give you a very short extremely short

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,040
uh technical history with the iot primer

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
just to sort of frame things and then

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,480
we're really going to just jump into the

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,879
stats some really interesting um war

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,440
stories from the trenches uh who some of

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
the biggest offenders are in terms of

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,920
iot devices and uh and then to make

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
things a little fun at the end you know

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
what what we can learn from star wars in

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
terms of how to deal with enterprise iot

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,840
security risk mitigation

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
so here's that short historical primer i

82
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,319
think this is a really great way to

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,000
frame iot

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,599
so if we think about innovations of

85
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
civilization sort of from from the dawn

86
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,519
of of of history if you will you know we

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,239
had cave paintings in 20000 bc

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
but we tend to have these big leaps

89
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,920
forward when when things

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,319
jump out whether that's the alphabet or

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,319
uh you know written language using paper

92
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,400
things of that nature but i draw your

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
attention to 1804 here with uh joseph

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
marija card and he invented uh the

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
automatic loom

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,680
now this is really interesting uh

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
making blankets and rugs and textiles

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,599
before this was all done completely

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,080
manual it was there was no automation

100
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
involved it was very laborious

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
and he invented this device

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,680
which was essentially the predecessor to

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
the computer was mechanical computer but

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
it had input it had output as storage

105
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,200
and if you look at some of these

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,879
pictures you can see it looks like punch

107
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,640
cards or you know

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,840
punch tape even which was the

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,480
predecessor to punch cards uh and that's

110
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
how i was processing this information

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
and essentially what happened was it

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,760
allowed um these manufacturers of these

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
textiles to increase productivity

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
sometimes over a thousand percent so

115
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,519
they're pretty amazing you could have

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,920
multiple looms inside a factory

117
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,720
so

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,639
arguably this is the world's first

119
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,279
computer leveraging uh mechanical

120
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,040
automation but some level of automation

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
to increase productivity

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
the back story to this is actually

123
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,520
pretty interesting because the employees

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
they were nervous about this they're

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,080
like look we're going to lose our jobs

126
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
to this computer they didn't call it a

127
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,600
computer but we're going to lose our

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
jobs to this thing

129
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
so they actually broke into the the

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
factories one night and they smashed

131
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
them they destroyed them

132
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,720
and i always thought it was very ironic

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,880
that the world's first computer suffered

134
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
a insider threat and we see those

135
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,080
insider threats as well on the iot side

136
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,840
and then of course we once we get over

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,520
to you know post arpanet like 1969 and

138
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,759
we get over to you know 1973 when we

139
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,240
start developing tcip and and ethernet

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
comes out we start having these major

141
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
leaps forward you know the personal

142
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,919
computer in 1980

143
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,160
but from an iot side

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
the first sort of roots the inkling we

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,080
didn't call it iot then it probably

146
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,759
really shouldn't be considered iot was

147
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,240
in 1982 a coke machine was actually

148
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,880
connected to arpanet to tell folks how

149
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
many uh cans were still in there there's

150
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
actually modern iot versions that live

151
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
in vending machines today that do

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
exactly that thing

153
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
probably built a little bit better

154
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,000
then we had web browsers

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
the first official iot device and this

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,720
was actually before the term iot came

157
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,759
out which wasn't even until i think 1999

158
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,080
but it was a tcp toaster that was the

159
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
first official iot device and that was

160
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,080
back in 1990 then linux comes out

161
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,639
in 91 we've got cameras on the web and

162
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
of course uh security cameras now are

163
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
one of the most common iot devices we

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
see in the enterprise and also one of

165
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
the most commonly exploited there's lots

166
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
of things you can do there

167
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,680
google's founded in 98 and then lg and

168
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
99 announces the first internet enabled

169
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
refrigerator i live in silicon valley

170
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,080
and i remember going to a fry's

171
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
electronics and seeing these types of

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
things and going oh that's really cool

173
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
i'm not sure

174
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,199
how practical the use cases are but it's

175
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,960
a really cool idea

176
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,759
the iphone comes out in 2007 and then we

177
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,800
just see a whole bunch of stuff

178
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
self-driving cars dublin in dublin

179
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,000
ireland becomes the first iot city

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
and uh now we're seeing global iot

181
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
sensors tracking everything from traffic

182
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
and weather and agricultural systems and

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
in temperature and how humans actually

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
move uh in different environments and

185
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,120
just massive amounts of data being fed

186
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,199
up and analyzed into satellite systems

187
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
from disparate iot devices absolutely

188
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
tremendous it's a trillion dollar market

189
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,360
and there's just billions and billions

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,199
and billions now of connected iot

191
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,919
devices far more than traditional i.t

192
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,440
devices of course

193
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
but even with all this great innovation

194
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,039
that we've had throughout these many

195
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,720
centuries

196
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
we see people trying to exploit them

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
right so this is a security discussion

198
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,360
so i really want to jump into uh sort of

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,319
how

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,280
innovations are often taken advantage of

201
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
and i thought a really easy way to look

202
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
at this was look at when the

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
commercialization first kicked in for a

204
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,440
certain advancement and then when

205
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
somebody tried to exploit it so the

206
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
first example pretty low tech by today's

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
standards but uh

208
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
using the c for trade the first

209
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,479
commercialization of the sea when

210
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
somebody says hey i have some stuff over

211
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,240
here why don't we stick out on a boat

212
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
and sell it to these folks over here

213
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
first records are about 3000 bc that was

214
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,199
in the mediterranean sea the first

215
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,479
pirates

216
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,599
weren't recorded until about 1300 bc

217
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,160
that's a about a 1700 year threat window

218
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,520
that's a pretty big threat window and

219
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,879
somebody said why don't we just rob that

220
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,319
boat

221
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,080
then we moved from c to air so in 1859

222
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
john weiss had this idea he would go

223
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
ahead and move things like mail and

224
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,360
other things of that nature via hot air

225
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,520
balloon really cool idea it crashed and

226
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,560
burned it literally crashed and burned

227
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,479
but we didn't have the first hijacking

228
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,479
until 1931 and that was actually in peru

229
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,479
the first commercialization of space in

230
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,280
the form of satellites was 1962. we

231
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,680
haven't seen a lot of exploitation in

232
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,919
space as it relates to satellite

233
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,840
exploitation or satellite warfare if you

234
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,160
will there have been some isolated cases

235
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
in 2015 there was the trula data theft

236
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,319
which had a command and control system

237
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,720
that leveraged satellites but

238
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
the juice really isn't worth the squeeze

239
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
in most cases that's kind of the realm

240
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,599
of nation states and we just haven't

241
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,839
seen a lot of satellite warfare um

242
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,519
happening next is the commercialization

243
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
of the internet right roughly around

244
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,279
1988 that's when nsfn mci mail said hey

245
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
you've got email users we've got email

246
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,959
users let's charge them and they can

247
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,240
email each other uh what a novel concept

248
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,360
um right about the same time uh we had

249
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
the morris worm

250
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,959
uh and some of you might be familiar

251
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
with that but it took uh advantage of

252
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,320
our commands and finger and things like

253
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,080
that and very quickly propagated amongst

254
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,920
connected devices far quicker than it

255
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
was supposed to propagate but that set

256
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
the threat window to about zero so we

257
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,720
started about 1700 years and now we're

258
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,080
about zero

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
and now we talk about the

260
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
commercialization of iot

261
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,959
this one's a little bit harder to pin

262
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,920
down but it's roughly about 2010 when it

263
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,080
became commercially popular we'll just

264
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,600
say that

265
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
in about 2016

266
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
we had the mirai botnet and i'm going to

267
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,279
talk a little bit more about that later

268
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,360
but that's considered by most people to

269
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,519
be the first

270
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,519
iot malware first iot relevant attack

271
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
so let's just jump into some of the

272
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,320
statistics now

273
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,440
so again phosphorus has been researching

274
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
uh organizations since 2007 millions of

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
devices global 2000s fortune 500s

276
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,160
government agencies large enterprises

277
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,480
all around the world and what we found

278
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,200
is about 67 percent of the organizations

279
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
we work with have had a known iot

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,880
security bridge

281
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
now we don't have great statistics on

282
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,880
the breaches we don't know about of

283
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,760
course

284
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
but i'd hazard to guess and i think

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,880
you're probably thinking the same thing

286
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
that number's probably a lot higher

287
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
they're just not aware of it because

288
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,079
there's not a lot of situational

289
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,320
awareness when it comes to iot

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
but you know almost 70 percent of these

291
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
devices

292
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
or almost 70 of these organizations have

293
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,640
had a known breach related to iot and we

294
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,720
talk about iot breaches

295
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,079
it's all the same stuff that you think

296
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,399
about on the i t side devices can be

297
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,240
compromised with malware they can be

298
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
added to botnets they can be leveraged

299
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
for ransomware video cameras can be uh

300
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
turned on to the people that installed

301
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
them and the audio is turned on and

302
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
they're actually

303
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
siphoning information off they're taking

304
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
video feeds and spying on these

305
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
individuals

306
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
oftentimes people will use the

307
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
compromise of an iot device to leapfrog

308
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
to an i.t device

309
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,079
we've seen cases where devices have been

310
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,079
compromised and an iot device they grab

311
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,880
sensitive information via various hacker

312
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
tools if you will

313
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
take that information back to that iot

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,279
device

315
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,279
compress it up and siphon it out the

316
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,760
organization to steal sensitive data and

317
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,200
of course there can be physical issues

318
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
as well unlocking doors shutting down

319
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,000
power

320
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,839
turning video cameras off again these

321
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,839
types of things so the same cyber

322
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,399
attacks we see on it

323
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,680
we also see on iot and iot can sometimes

324
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,959
be used as a leap frog to i.t attacks in

325
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,800
addition to that of course iot attacks

326
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
can have a big impact on the physical

327
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
world as well all the way up to and

328
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
including asset destruction in some

329
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,839
cases

330
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,399
so a couple more stats here

331
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,800
we started talking to security teams

332
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,959
figure out hey do you folks really have

333
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,120
your arms around at least in inventory

334
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,279
do you know what iot devices you have

335
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,680
about 20 said yeah we can we can

336
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
identify most of them eighty percent

337
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
don't really have a good clue about what

338
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
devices they have

339
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
and one of the reasons is there's just

340
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,040
so many and there's so many different

341
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
groups that deploy these in different

342
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,560
organizations that they just don't have

343
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,680
an idea

344
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
on the positive side though they realize

345
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,120
it's a security issue and almost every

346
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
organization has started increasing

347
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
spending as it relates to iot security

348
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,920
so that's a positive note

349
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
this slide i just said yikes i didn't

350
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
really know what else to call it so i

351
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,519
went over to showdown and i think most

352
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,480
of you are familiar with that the

353
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,399
showdown search engine to see which

354
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,480
devices are

355
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
internet accessible if you will

356
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,720
and i just typed in a couple terms that

357
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
you would think of for iot devices i've

358
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,600
got camera

359
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,519
voice over ip

360
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,160
printer and ups so not very scientific

361
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,399
just typed them in uh but what we find

362
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,880
here is almost 5 million cameras you

363
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,079
know over 250 000 voice over ip phones

364
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,440
uh you know 83 000 plus printers and

365
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,000
almost 14 000 ups systems which oh my

366
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
gosh

367
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
and the thing about ups systems i won't

368
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
tell you but you can google this the

369
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,399
password is almost never changed and

370
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,639
it's a very very simple password on

371
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
these it's actually the same credential

372
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,920
for username and password on these

373
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,839
devices i don't know why they would be

374
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,560
exposed on the internet but uh iot

375
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
devices don't need to be exposed to the

376
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
internet for these attacks to happen but

377
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
certainly the fact that many of them are

378
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,800
increase the likelihood

379
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,399
also we're seeing a lot of nation states

380
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,880
now paying attention to iot and

381
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,639
investing quite a bit

382
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
and this is globally so

383
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,279
russia has this tool called frontend

384
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,880
which was developed for them by some

385
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,800
contractors specifically for the russian

386
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,680
fsb and this was an iot hacking tool

387
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,320
designed to find

388
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,839
compromise

389
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,920
and compromise iot devices install

390
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
command and control software and do

391
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,680
whatever they wanted from that point or

392
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,440
also use as a jumping off point to get

393
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
in deeper into organizations

394
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
interestingly a hacking group called

395
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
digital revolution got their hands on

396
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,680
frontend

397
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,000
and released the code so you can get it

398
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,800
from

399
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
torrents and all the all the places that

400
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,440
you like to get your hacking tools from

401
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
another interesting case is uh there

402
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,600
have been iot devices that have been

403
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,199
banned actually the us house of

404
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
representative has passed bills that

405
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,279
prohibit federal agencies and

406
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,079
contractors from actually using certain

407
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,720
iot devices so i mean they're they're

408
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
that well known to have that level of

409
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,000
vulnerability that they're they're just

410
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,279
not allowed

411
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
so let's just jump into some stories

412
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
from the trenches these are always

413
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
really interesting and um you know i

414
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,120
mentioned earlier mirai botnet so for

415
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
those of you who aren't aware again

416
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
that's from 2016 i'll go a little bit

417
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,000
deeper

418
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
very very simple uh attack essentially

419
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
uh

420
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
some attackers scanned the internet we

421
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,760
just saw what you could do with showdown

422
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,040
looking for

423
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,120
uh specifically video cameras to start

424
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
with that we're running telnet and

425
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
they're running telnet on port 23 and

426
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
port 2323

427
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
on these on these video cameras and if

428
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,880
they found one that they could get

429
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,639
access to they tried the default

430
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,800
password and they tried a handful i

431
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,279
think about a half dozen or a dozen

432
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,959
very common passwords as well if the

433
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,360
default password wasn't being used

434
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,279
what was interesting is there was a lot

435
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,639
of devices that were one accessible two

436
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,959
they were accessible via telnet and

437
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,040
three they were running a default or or

438
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,519
very common password so there was enough

439
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,279
of these devices taken over to actually

440
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,360
create a pretty big botnet but one of

441
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,440
the issues that's unique in iot is

442
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,279
organizations and manufacturers that

443
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,360
make iot devices aren't necessarily

444
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
software development organizations they

445
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,959
don't have a secure software development

446
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,040
life cycle in fact a lot of times they

447
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
just want to take this thing

448
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
and they want to get it online however

449
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
they do that so they they do it on the

450
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
cheap they do it as quickly as possible

451
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,320
and they use a lot of shared libraries

452
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,079
they use there's a lot of white labeling

453
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,600
done or i'll grab this component in that

454
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
component because it's all about speed i

455
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
just want to put this thing online

456
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
certainly security is not an issue so

457
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,399
when it came to mirai when they found

458
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
all these cameras with this insecure

459
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
build what they also started finding

460
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,839
what these attackers found was that

461
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,079
there was voice over ip phones and

462
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,320
printers and other devices that had very

463
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
similar configurations so they got added

464
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,000
to the mix as well and it wasn't just

465
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
cameras

466
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
but fast forward now now that they've

467
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
got this huge

468
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
botnet that they're controlling cameras

469
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,199
printers voiceover ip phones so on and

470
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,120
so forth with their command and control

471
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,440
software and they launched ddos attacks

472
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,120
and they're actually able to severely

473
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
disrupt pretty big tech companies

474
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
twitter paypal netflix github and some

475
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,880
telecoms and many many others so again

476
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,920
this was a

477
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,519
super simple attack it's hard to even

478
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,279
call it attack it was more of just like

479
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,320
a search

480
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
and then they uploaded some malicious

481
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,160
software and they caused great harm and

482
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,639
that was with mirai botnet now the sad

483
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,480
thing is because the half-life of most

484
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,600
firmware

485
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680
meaning that firmware usually sits there

486
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,519
vulnerable on these devices for a very

487
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,240
long time and passwords are often pretty

488
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
weak or default means that there is

489
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
devices

490
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
today

491
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,760
that are still vulnerable to this

492
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,439
specific attack and it's still floating

493
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,559
around the internet even though it

494
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,559
started back in 2016.

495
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,039
even worse there's still devices that

496
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,640
are compromised and they're running the

497
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
malicious code and the organizations has

498
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,959
these all these cameras or printers or

499
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,480
phones or whatever they have that are

500
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,559
infected and they don't even know it

501
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,319
right so pretty pretty sad state of

502
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,400
affairs

503
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,199
so

504
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
passwords so this is a really

505
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
interesting thing when we think about

506
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,960
passwords or just credentials as a

507
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
general term

508
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,240
it's like the most basic step in

509
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,360
security but what we find is about about

510
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,679
fifty percent on average of the devices

511
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,160
we can encounter have default passwords

512
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
now while that's the average there's

513
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,840
there's some interesting skus to each

514
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,400
side there's some audio video equipment

515
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,880
um iot devices for example where we find

516
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
about 95

517
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,760
of the time it's default credentials

518
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,280
and then there's some other devices as

519
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,919
well where when you install them

520
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,520
the default password has to be changed

521
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,880
as part of the installation process

522
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
which is generally a good idea

523
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,720
and so there's some some different sides

524
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,840
to this curve but sadly when we do find

525
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,919
a device that's not a default password

526
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,400
in fact the password has been changed

527
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,520
one it's usually not changed to

528
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,039
something very good

529
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,039
because again people just have so many

530
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,039
iot devices they tend to give them a

531
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,400
very simple name and they give

532
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
everything the same password but usually

533
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
the password was only changed once

534
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
for that printer that kvm switch or that

535
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,880
rack or that ups system maybe was

536
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
changed at the point of installation

537
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,520
five ten years ago who knows

538
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,360
um but another problem is about a

539
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,039
hundred percent of the passwords are out

540
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
of compliance in terms of how often are

541
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,760
they rotated every 30 60 90 days usually

542
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,960
they're not

543
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,720
are they essentially managed probably

544
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,640
not there's probably no pam integration

545
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,679
with like a hashicorp

546
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,840
psychotic

547
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,080
uh cyber art tools of that nature and

548
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
then the complexities off right maybe

549
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
it's just abc123 it's not uppercase

550
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,799
lowercase numbers special characters all

551
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,320
the things that we we know as best

552
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
practices

553
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,160
so here's an interesting case we were

554
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,240
working with a financial services

555
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,919
organization that was involved with uh

556
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,320
stock trading and they had these atomic

557
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
clocks these are actually cesium clocks

558
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,919
and all these devices i'm showing by the

559
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,640
way it's not the actual brand uh that

560
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
popped up there this is just a photo to

561
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,480
give you a representation but what was

562
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
interesting here is um they knew about

563
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
six of these

564
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,840
clocks

565
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,360
and these these aren't cheap clocks

566
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
they're they're about 12k each

567
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
which isn't expensive for some

568
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,799
organizations but still quite a bit of

569
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,440
money um but they knew about six of them

570
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,679
we actually discovered 15 of them

571
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,919
so more than half they didn't they were

572
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,919
aware that they had them so they had all

573
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,840
these cesium atomic clocks and they're

574
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,919
very important for their role and as

575
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,440
many of you probably know if i buy a

576
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,679
stock and you buy a stock and you get a

577
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,679
two millisecond advantage over me that

578
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,760
can have a dramatic and profound

579
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
financial impact right so they're really

580
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,960
important

581
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
what's interesting about these clocks is

582
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,640
there were no cves on these

583
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
and i don't want to say it's because

584
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,679
they're they were ultra secure they were

585
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,919
good devices but they're pretty esoteric

586
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,520
so not a lot of people are poking and

587
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,200
prodding them it's not like a a common

588
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,120
printer or camera or something like that

589
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,480
but what's really interesting again was

590
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
the inventory issue they just had no

591
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,480
idea they had those devices there so

592
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
because of that there was nobody

593
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
watching the security making sure they

594
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
were updated they had strong passwords

595
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
and that sort of thing so a lot of the

596
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,919
time it's just knowing what you've got

597
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,679
and in our research what we've actually

598
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,960
discovered and this these numbers

599
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
actually blew me away before i really

600
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,919
started getting involved with these

601
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,360
organizations

602
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,760
there's about three to five iot devices

603
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,799
per employee so this is the the craziest

604
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,760
looking uh possible chart to show that

605
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
but if we just look at ten thousand

606
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,799
employees for example ten thousand

607
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,919
employees you probably have somewhere

608
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,919
between thirty thousand and fifty

609
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,159
thousand iot devices that's a lot of

610
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,320
devices and it's way more devices than

611
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,280
you could possibly manually manage in

612
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,440
terms of taking care of the firmware and

613
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,039
taking care of the passwords and turning

614
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,600
off uh unneeded services it's just

615
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
completely untenable you need automated

616
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
tools you need a centralized process to

617
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
handle that but it just kind of shows

618
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,280
you the breadth and depth of this

619
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
problem now if you look at law firms for

620
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,120
example they'll have a little bit less

621
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,880
you look at retailers they'll actually

622
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
have quite a bit more so it kind of

623
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,039
depends on industry but on average take

624
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,559
a look at your organization there's

625
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,280
probably about three to five iot devices

626
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,760
per employee right and we'll get into

627
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
some of the iot devices that we see

628
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
quite a bit of in the worst offenders

629
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,039
and you'll start going okay yeah if i

630
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,400
start including these things i can

631
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
completely see how that goes

632
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,559
and just like with the stock exchange we

633
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,480
were talking about those cesium clocks

634
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
when we go into organizations to do a

635
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,960
proof of value and we say hey how many

636
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,559
devices do you think you have iot

637
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,720
devices and they'll say i don't know i

638
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
have x

639
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,280
almost 100 of the time their numbers are

640
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,080
off by about 40 to 60 percent so again

641
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
they just didn't know about half of

642
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,799
their devices in their environment

643
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,400
so we talked about printers a little bit

644
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
before

645
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,760
printers are are really a special case

646
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,960
because everyone's got them and

647
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,799
everyone's got a lot of them we work

648
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,559
with some folks in the hospitality

649
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,320
industry for example where they have

650
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,799
tens and tens of thousands of printers

651
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,720
just printers different models and

652
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,039
brands and you know versions and things

653
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
like that but they have lots of printers

654
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,880
now the thing about printers is most

655
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
sort of enterprise level printers have

656
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,400
about a 20 gig hard drive it's not huge

657
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,840
it's not small but it's a pretty good

658
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,120
size hard drive

659
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,720
and what had happened is some attackers

660
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,400
had gotten access to these these

661
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,679
printers

662
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,880
which by the way most of these are

663
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,960
uncommon operating systems like linux or

664
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,559
android and things of this nature in

665
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,360
fact across all iot a flavor of linux or

666
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,120
a flavor of android is by far the most

667
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
common thing that you'll find and by the

668
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
way they have a lot of the same

669
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
capabilities services

670
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
in the case of printers however they're

671
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,159
far more promiscuous in running so many

672
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,520
different protocols they've got every

673
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,039
protocol imaginable because they want to

674
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,039
be easy to use they want people to be

675
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
able to connect to them and use them

676
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
it's the point of the printer so from

677
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,159
that perspective it makes great sense

678
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,240
but attackers know that and because they

679
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,679
know that they take advantage of the

680
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,120
fact that those printers are so

681
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,880
promiscuous and there are so many ways

682
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,039
to connect with them so

683
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,720
in this particular case some attackers

684
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
had gained access to the printer they

685
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,320
had uploaded some of their tools and

686
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,159
this was only to a few dozen printers at

687
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,840
the time but it did expand greatly to

688
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
hundreds later on

689
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,360
and they used those to go out searching

690
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
for other critical devices on the

691
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,360
network i t devices primarily and from

692
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
them they were extracting data this was

693
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,760
all about um intellectual property theft

694
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,440
they were extracting the data and then

695
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,200
they were storing it on those 20 gig

696
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
hard drives and i'll get to what happens

697
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
next well a lot of this activity because

698
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,080
it was all being controlled through um

699
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,720
various remote connectivity uh controls

700
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,360
and and c2 and things of that nature uh

701
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,200
it created logs and those logs were

702
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,880
showing up in splunk and they were

703
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
anomalous they said hey we've got a lot

704
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
of printers that seem to be pretty

705
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,039
chatty and we're not really sure why and

706
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,840
then what they were seeing was data

707
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,520
exfiltration and these printers

708
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
they're being set up to exfil data over

709
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,720
icmp why because everybody allows icmpo

710
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,799
and even if it's shut off network ops

711
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,400
turns it back on to do some testing they

712
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,159
forget to turn it off just a really easy

713
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,760
way to exfiltrate data you have to make

714
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,679
the packets pretty small takes a little

715
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,279
bit longer but it usually goes under the

716
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,440
radar so they're using these printers to

717
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,559
grab it sensitive data compressing it up

718
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,799
exfiltrating out over icmp which

719
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,520
eventually caused some alarms to go up

720
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,559
and what they found was when they

721
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,000
started looking at these printers and

722
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,679
say god it's not just one or two it's we

723
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,679
have several dozen now more than a

724
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,400
hundred now they're infected um it was

725
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,159
just the firmware they're running really

726
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,840
old firmware some of these devices

727
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,080
hadn't been updated and uh up to 10

728
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,840
years most of them hadn't been upgraded

729
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,159
for about four or five years at least so

730
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,840
they were just sitting there vulnerable

731
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,799
they were doing their job they're

732
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,240
working fine as printers and usually

733
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
most people don't pay attention to a

734
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,640
printer until it stops well printing so

735
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,159
the fact that they are running all this

736
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,039
old firmware just made them a big target

737
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,880
with a big juicy hard drive and an easy

738
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,000
way to exfiltrate that data out

739
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,520
now talking about firmware about 26 of

740
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,600
the devices we counter

741
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,679
have end of life firmware meaning that

742
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,600
there's just just nothing we can do with

743
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,960
that firmware it's completely end of

744
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,159
life if you're running it you have to

745
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,880
get on a newer version of it

746
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,720
of the remaining 74

747
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,600
the average age was 6 years old

748
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,520
think about your smartphone it probably

749
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,159
wouldn't work if you hadn't updated

750
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,080
things in six years and i'm almost

751
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,760
certain it wouldn't work

752
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,799
but now you're talking about your

753
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,120
enterprise devices again all of your key

754
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,640
systems especially the systems that

755
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,279
manage other systems and that's a really

756
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,279
a scary step because if we think about

757
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,640
it again there's not a lot of difference

758
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,360
between an it device and an iot device

759
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,000
in terms of capability network access

760
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
and the type of negative ramifications

761
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
it can cause upon your environment and

762
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
again with iot you can even cause

763
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,159
physical harm

764
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,240
so if i went and told you 26 percent of

765
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,080
your it devices were our end of life

766
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,320
firmware you jump off this video right

767
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,919
now and you go fix those that's how

768
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,159
serious this is

769
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,919
so here was a case that i thought was

770
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,200
pretty interesting too this was very

771
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,840
recently this was a ddos attack against

772
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,080
a microsoft azure customer

773
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
and uh they had

774
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,440
a little over 10 000 iot devices that

775
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
were compromised and there was no

776
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,320
real specific

777
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
uh sort of vulnerability that was being

778
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,919
compromised it was just general

779
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,440
vulnerabilities that tend to sit on

780
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,960
these systems a lot of them run

781
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,480
high-level vulnerabilities and they have

782
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,559
a lot of open services to get in they're

783
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,799
writing clear text protocols like ftp

784
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,039
tftp telnet

785
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,240
they've got things that maybe they don't

786
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,159
need to be running uh in terms of

787
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,039
various services old tls self-signed

788
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,960
certs all sorts of vulnerabilities just

789
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
in terms of the services they're running

790
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,640
their configurations and of course any

791
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
native vulnerabilities so there's no

792
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,559
really rhyme or reason to say it was

793
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,640
just this version of a kvm switch that

794
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,600
was exploited and used for a ddos attack

795
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,880
what was interesting about this

796
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
particular attack against these azure

797
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,559
customers was that it ended up being

798
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,919
3.4 terabits per second

799
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,039
now a 3.47 terabit per second ddos

800
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,919
attack is the largest ddos attack in

801
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,960
history

802
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,760
not the largest iot ddos in history but

803
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,640
the largest attack in history regardless

804
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,440
of it or iot so again this just gives

805
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,679
you a sense the power of these devices

806
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,679
and once you grasp that it's just a

807
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,919
linux server yeah it acts as a camera or

808
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,000
acts as a ups system or acts as a rack

809
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,120
whatever

810
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,600
but it's a it's a computer so they have

811
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,360
these capabilities and they can cause

812
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,760
these negative ramifications

813
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,600
so when we start digging into the actual

814
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,919
statistics around the vulnerabilities

815
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,679
what we found and this is this is

816
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,360
probably one of the the most frightening

817
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,080
statistics so far

818
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,799
the cvss scores so scores of of one to

819
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,799
ten ten being the most grievous fifty

820
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,960
percent of the devices have a score of

821
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,399
an eight

822
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,760
in additional

823
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,960
18

824
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,039
have scores of nine or ten these are

825
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,960
high to critical level vulnerabilities

826
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,000
these are the type of vulnerabilities

827
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,080
where you don't need local access um you

828
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,000
can do remote exploitation they're very

829
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,320
uh they're very severe the great

830
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,520
majority of the vulnerabilities

831
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
discovered on these devices were eights

832
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
nines and tens

833
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,279
that's a scary thought again this is one

834
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,559
of those things where if this these were

835
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,039
your it devices you'd be like oh my god

836
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,480
what can i do

837
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,039
but because iot devices historically

838
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,120
have been so hard to first of all just

839
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,480
discover

840
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,880
then manage then manage the passwords

841
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,000
address the vulnerabilities in the

842
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,080
patching and the firmware uh managed

843
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,760
services etc

844
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,840
nothing's been

845
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,559
done and

846
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,960
i i guess a good analogy for this is iot

847
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,799
security today is kind of like i t

848
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,799
security was in 1995 and this is right

849
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,640
about when i started my career in

850
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
security

851
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,640
but there's no inventory or very little

852
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,039
or was kept on a spreadsheet somewhere

853
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,840
manually poor passwords um there was a

854
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,760
password policy that was written by your

855
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,600
infosec team but

856
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
that you know it was just a policy and

857
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
there was poor patch management right it

858
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
just wasn't taken care of that's the

859
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,279
same thing we're seeing on iot today

860
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,360
we've gotten past most of these issues

861
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,679
by and large um

862
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,080
in the i.t world but in the iot world

863
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,679
we're still stuck in

864
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,760
coolio's gangster paradise xena princess

865
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,600
warrior time frame

866
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
and windows nt 3.51

867
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and i remember when i started just to

868
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,080
kind of frame sort of what you know the

869
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
types of projects back then my first

870
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,200
project and a lot of you might recognize

871
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,279
this us robotics modem here

872
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,440
i was on this project called

873
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
umap the unauthorized modem abatement

874
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,960
project what a what a great acronym um

875
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
all it meant is hey we have all these

876
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,799
modems around our campus we've got to

877
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,320
figure out if we need them because

878
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,600
they're back doors for hackers and

879
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,799
they're going to get it and do hacker

880
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,600
stuff

881
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,039
like angela angelia jolie did as uh acid

882
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,720
burn and hackers right so

883
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,320
that was a project so i used this tool

884
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,919
that in that next picture which is tone

885
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,679
loc which was written by minor

886
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,080
threatened mucho moss and ran under dos

887
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,960
and i actually would scan the entire uh

888
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,200
phone system in pbx lines to figure out

889
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
which ones were responding as a phone a

890
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,480
fax machine or a actual modem and then

891
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,000
based on that i'd have to physically go

892
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,520
hunt it down and figure out who owned it

893
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
and say do you need this or not if you

894
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,279
don't i could unplug it so i had

895
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,200
literally boxes and boxes of these

896
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
things not as nice as some of these uos

897
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,080
robotics ones but some pretty bad ones

898
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,679
also at this time

899
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,720
we were going to start scanning for

900
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,480
vulnerabilities which was

901
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,159
somewhat of a new concept so i had this

902
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,320
tool that dan farmer wrote called satan

903
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,080
security analysis tool for analyzing

904
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,000
networks which is how i learned how to

905
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,279
write perl because the whole thing was

906
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,600
written in pearl and i ran it on this

907
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,080
sun spark one plus pizza box which is

908
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,200
kind of hidden behind my my video there

909
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,799
and that's what i use for scanning for

910
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,320
vulnerabilities and we said hey you know

911
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,919
what we need we need a firewall now

912
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,200
there's this thing called the firewall

913
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,720
we're not just going to use access

914
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,480
control lists in our routers so i

915
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,919
actually turned the device that i was

916
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,440
doing vulnerability scanning on i didn't

917
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,960
take satan off of it

918
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
but we actually threw a couple nicks on

919
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,240
there or one more nick so we could have

920
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,159
two so that became our firewall and

921
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,360
loaded checkpoint on there with three

922
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,039
and a half inch floppy disks so the

923
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,519
device i was using for my firewall was

924
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,760
actually the device that we were us also

925
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,200
using for vulnerability scanning and

926
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,120
then we eventually threw a third nick on

927
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,880
there because that was our dmz because

928
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,360
we're super secure it was crazy we

929
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,279
didn't know what we were doing we have

930
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,360
we're just doing stuff

931
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,760
but again that was it security back in

932
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
the mid 90s and that's kind of where iot

933
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,159
security is is today

934
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,360
so now

935
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,399
let's dive into the biggest iot

936
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,799
offenders and these are the devices

937
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,120
where we see sort of the most grievous

938
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,039
issues across the board now we see a lot

939
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,880
of other devices that i'm not listing

940
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,679
here

941
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,760
but uh you know we just had to sort of

942
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,679
condense into the the ones that keep on

943
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,720
ringing out as being problematic um

944
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,039
again the the pictures that you see here

945
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,039
are not the actual brands i'm not not

946
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,720
gonna call anybody out here that's not

947
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,679
the the focus here but kvm switches

948
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,039
again most of you are probably familiar

949
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,080
with kvm switches um but kvm switch you

950
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
stick it in a rack uh you connect it to

951
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320
multiple computers and it lets you

952
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,440
control

953
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,360
keyboard and mouse and video and

954
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,519
sometimes you can cycle power as well we

955
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,679
come across a lot of these devices that

956
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,679
are running like linux ubuntu version

957
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,480
10. well that's from 2010

958
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
right i think the latest version now is

959
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,840
21 point something it's a little bit

960
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,000
past 21.1

961
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,320
um so this is it's running old stuff and

962
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,000
because of that it doesn't just have a

963
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,640
few but they have a hundreds hundreds of

964
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,000
vulnerabilities

965
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,440
now think about this

966
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,039
i've spent a lot of money on my endpoint

967
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,799
security and application security

968
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,200
identity this and network security that

969
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,039
and now i've got this kvm switch that

970
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,200
can back door into all these devices

971
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,919
running a version of linux that's uh

972
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,960
more than a decade old

973
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
that if i'm an attacker and i can

974
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,080
compromise that i can do a lot of

975
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,760
malicious things so those devices that

976
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,120
are connected i can probably power them

977
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,679
off i can change configurations i can

978
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,360
you know modify

979
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,960
stuff steal stuff whatever i wanted to

980
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
do so that's a huge back door and that's

981
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,720
one of the reasons that a lot of nation

982
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,080
states and we talked about russia

983
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,880
earlier are building these tools because

984
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,640
why bang your head through the firewall

985
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,279
and the ips and the encryption that and

986
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,279
application security and endpoint

987
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,440
security what i can just

988
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,240
go around that back door again like 1995

989
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,840
with that u.s robotics modem plugged

990
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,240
into the back of that windows nt 351

991
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,679
server in the back of the data center

992
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,159
that everybody forgot about right

993
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,320
so kvm switch is one of the biggest

994
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,640
offenders that we see out there

995
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,960
another big one lights out management

996
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,320
controls

997
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,159
so if you look at the back of this

998
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,240
of this server we see a couple ethernet

999
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
ports on the right and something that

1000
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,600
looks like an ethernet port where that

1001
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
arrow is well that's not an ethernet

1002
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,240
port

1003
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,000
that's a lights out management port

1004
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,120
right that's that's what you're going to

1005
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,360
use for management these devices

1006
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,039
well the thing the thing about these is

1007
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,559
there's a few different flavors there's

1008
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,399
hp has ilo

1009
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,440
dell has idrac

1010
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,320
super micro has ipmi

1011
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,000
so there's a few different flavors those

1012
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,440
are the main ones they're just little

1013
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,280
linux servers in fact there's malware

1014
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,879
specifically designed to target those

1015
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,560
little linux servers for lights out

1016
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,399
management systems and again like the

1017
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,000
kvm switches but a little bit more

1018
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,839
powerful actually these lights out

1019
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,159
management controls bypass all that

1020
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,679
other security that you put on top of

1021
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,119
that server so you can have 10 million

1022
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,719
dollars of endpoint security on top of

1023
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,040
this thing but if that interface isn't

1024
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,879
secure if it's running a default

1025
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,520
password for example or a weak password

1026
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,199
or has a vulnerability in it that can be

1027
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,199
exploited because that version of linux

1028
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,599
or vx work that's running on that has

1029
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,239
not been updated in the last 10 years

1030
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,599
that's a problem

1031
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,199
because now as an attacker the things i

1032
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,040
can do for that is i can shut the system

1033
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,680
down i can change the network settings i

1034
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,920
can run a shell some of these guys i can

1035
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,320
pop open a virtual terminal as well i

1036
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,359
can upload software or malware

1037
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,440
i can do all the bad stuff

1038
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,839
that an attacker would want to do and

1039
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,599
again most of your critical servers are

1040
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
going to have these devices

1041
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,400
and some people say oh well you know i

1042
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
don't even know that thing was there and

1043
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,119
that's the problem again because there's

1044
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,960
no good inventory for discovery for a

1045
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,839
lot of these a lot of these products

1046
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,760
server cabinets and racks this is

1047
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,320
another one that people tend to go oh

1048
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,160
those do have a lot of iot devices they

1049
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,680
sure do ups systems which are notorious

1050
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,520
for having the vendor's default password

1051
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,119
which takes about five seconds to find

1052
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,359
if you google it cooling systems cable

1053
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,079
management tamper resistance um sensors

1054
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,839
and all sorts of other things depending

1055
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,599
on how fancy that rack happens to be and

1056
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,560
they're really cool and they're really

1057
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,040
capable they're almost always running

1058
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,920
the oldest firmware known to man

1059
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,599
and the reason for that i think the

1060
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,320
primary reason is if i want to upload

1061
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,839
all the firmware on my rack including my

1062
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,000
ups system everything else i need to

1063
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,079
reboot that system in most cases which

1064
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,320
means all those devices that are relying

1065
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,119
on that switching gear routing gear

1066
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,359
computer systems etc they're going to

1067
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,400
have to be

1068
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
rebooted as well so there has to be a

1069
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,000
change window and when people schedule

1070
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,359
change windows they don't always think

1071
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,680
about iot devices unfortunately which

1072
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,480
causes this problem so these devices are

1073
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
frequently frequently vulnerable and a

1074
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
lot of these are also tied to kvm

1075
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,680
switches that we talked about earlier

1076
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,119
exposing you to a lot of problems

1077
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,880
physical access controllers here's

1078
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,240
another case where you probably have

1079
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
oodles and noodles of these throughout

1080
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,560
your environment whether it's biometrics

1081
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,760
or

1082
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,000
you know a pin or a scan card or a cac

1083
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
system whatever the solution might be

1084
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,320
again these are these are linux devices

1085
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,240
that are that are running on the network

1086
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
and in one particular case

1087
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,000
we're working with a customer

1088
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,200
and they had uh the system deployed

1089
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,800
it was uh

1090
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,880
it was all default passwords but if

1091
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,040
those passwords were not default and

1092
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,720
it's crazy to find the default passwords

1093
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,160
on door locks

1094
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,839
it's crazy to think but you always find

1095
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,480
it

1096
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,640
they had three critical cpes so have

1097
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
that default password

1098
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,640
not been there it would have been easy

1099
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,680
enough to get through one of the

1100
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,119
critical seats one of the three you

1101
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,960
could pick the one that you like most to

1102
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,640
get into that system

1103
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,920
and we're sitting with the cso and uh

1104
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,839
their team and we're actually able to

1105
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,839
show them with a click of a button we

1106
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,880
could have locked or unlocked all 6400

1107
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,560
doors door lock systems that they had

1108
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,839
throughout this financial services

1109
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,200
company

1110
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,400
and again the iot tax iot devices can

1111
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,839
have that impact on the physical world

1112
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,599
uh printers we talked a little bit about

1113
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,000
printers before they're certainly one of

1114
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,320
the most commonly attacked devices

1115
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
especially from nation states but cyber

1116
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,320
criminals like them too

1117
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
if any of you are at black hat back in

1118
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,160
2019 in vegas

1119
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,079
uh there was some research that was

1120
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,440
released where they found critical level

1121
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,040
vulnerabilities again these are level 10

1122
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,920
vulnerabilities on over 10 000 different

1123
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
printer types and brands and there's

1124
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,200
just so many different types of printers

1125
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
out there but that's that's pretty

1126
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,079
incredible over over 10 000 devices had

1127
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,240
critical level vulnerabilities and again

1128
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,599
they're highly promiscuous they're

1129
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,760
running a lot of services they've got

1130
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,599
wired and wired list connections they

1131
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,200
probably have bluetooth they might be

1132
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
running other other protocols as well

1133
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,160
you can manage it via https or ssh some

1134
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,320
of you can tell that into they're just

1135
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
very very open and that's taking

1136
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,760
advantage and again because a lot of

1137
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,240
them have that big storage drive

1138
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,000
it's great to use them to attack it

1139
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,560
devices and exfiltrate your data out the

1140
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,079
way we talked about it before but again

1141
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,400
it's one of the biggest targets

1142
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
for state-sponsored hackers i would say

1143
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,040
it's probably in the top three

1144
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,200
next one voiceover ip phones and video

1145
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,520
conferencing systems

1146
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,800
like printers

1147
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,040
organizations have a ton of voice over

1148
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,560
ip systems

1149
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,880
and even when people weren't at

1150
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,480
at the office there's still so many

1151
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,800
active iot systems that we actually saw

1152
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,640
an uptick in the number of attacks on

1153
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,720
iot devices but now i guess they're

1154
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,400
calling it the great return here in

1155
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,320
silicon valley we see you know the likes

1156
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,640
of apple and facebook and google people

1157
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,720
are all going back to work again

1158
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,079
traffic's increasing because of that

1159
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,760
which is usually a pretty good sign

1160
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,240
probably an iot device could detect that

1161
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,000
but there's a lot of these voice over

1162
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,520
iphones and they're usually running a

1163
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,599
flavor of android

1164
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,839
what we find with a lot of these devices

1165
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,800
is they've got undocumented ssh

1166
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,720
administration capabilities running on

1167
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,599
them with default credentials again

1168
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,040
and a lot of this goes back to what we

1169
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,560
were talking about before with the

1170
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,800
manufacturers of some of these devices

1171
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,480
aren't necessarily software development

1172
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,640
houses they're more they manufacture

1173
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,320
things sometimes like farm equipment and

1174
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,000
things of that nature

1175
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,079
so they have a small crew

1176
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,359
they're not putting a lot of time and

1177
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,200
effort into into testing certainly not

1178
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
looking at security or if they are it's

1179
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,160
very little

1180
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,359
and because of that they're saying well

1181
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,040
i'm just going to white label that i'm

1182
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,560
going to use that library from that

1183
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,240
group and they might not even know they

1184
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,480
have that undocumented

1185
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,000
ssh with default credentials right

1186
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
it just got rolled out that way because

1187
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,200
they hadn't done that level of testing

1188
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
so that's a that's a pretty scary thing

1189
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,599
with this one organization i guess you

1190
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,040
can call this a beacon of hope but maybe

1191
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,760
it's kind of sad they had 31 000 phones

1192
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,040
only 700 only 700 had a critical level

1193
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,240
cve

1194
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,400
as we know it really only takes one so

1195
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,800
these again are uh an example of

1196
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,319
something that there's just so many

1197
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,720
they're so voluminous 31 000 phone

1198
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,560
systems if you wanted to upgrade the

1199
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,880
firmware or rotate the passwords every

1200
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,560
90 days that you use for managing those

1201
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,960
or whatever steps it would be impossible

1202
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,400
to try to do these things manually

1203
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,920
and then the last group i wanted to

1204
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,400
cover were secure our security cameras

1205
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,319
these suck the most

1206
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,400
there's so many of them and there's so

1207
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,319
many problems again some of these

1208
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,760
cameras ship directly from their

1209
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,680
manufacturers with the malware already

1210
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,440
installed so you skip the middleman you

1211
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,200
just go straight to straight to being

1212
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,319
infected and having your device

1213
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,520
controlled

1214
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,280
these cameras have been known to

1215
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,960
actually turn on when they're supposed

1216
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,280
to be off they're known to record audio

1217
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,960
when they're supposed to be on new and

1218
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,480
they also take these streams and they

1219
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,079
can pipe them back

1220
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,319
to various countries so that's a problem

1221
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,160
right there again a lot of these devices

1222
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,480
have been banned but cameras are devices

1223
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,920
that if they're compromised they can

1224
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,319
certainly be used for spying we

1225
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,839
mentioned some of the attacks that are

1226
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,680
very common in it and iot and how

1227
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,920
they're the same from ransomware to data

1228
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,400
theft ddos command and control

1229
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
malware distribution things of that

1230
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,119
nature

1231
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,520
one case we were working with a customer

1232
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,160
um i think they had something like 9000

1233
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,880
or 9500 a lot they had a lot of video

1234
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,760
cameras and they had been crypto jacked

1235
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,680
uh most of you probably know that means

1236
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,119
i want to take this device and i want to

1237
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,280
use it to mine crypto so they had all

1238
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,720
these cameras that were doing crypto

1239
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,040
mining um and the way they detected it

1240
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,720
i'd love to say it was some cool sim

1241
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,560
tool or alerted this it was their power

1242
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
bill their power bill was really really

1243
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,800
high and they didn't know why if you've

1244
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,400
ever looked at organizations that do

1245
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,040
crypto mining it's uh it's pretty

1246
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,640
energy intensive so that's how they

1247
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,400
found it um these guys are usually

1248
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,160
running linux usually some form of like

1249
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,800
busybox which is a common a common piece

1250
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,079
that's on there

1251
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,359
and the thing that's interesting about

1252
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,520
video cameras is a lot of the older ones

1253
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,319
are designed so i have 10 000 cameras

1254
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,079
but they all have to have the exact same

1255
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,680
password that's talking to the

1256
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,200
management console like something like

1257
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,800
you see here in the middle

1258
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,680
um

1259
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,480
which

1260
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,160
which is an architectural flaw i mean

1261
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,200
you could set it up and there's some

1262
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,280
newer ones where you have the streaming

1263
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
password is the same but the management

1264
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,640
password is different so it has two

1265
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,280
different passwords uh because of that

1266
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,040
issue so when you're talking about

1267
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,599
password management on these things uh

1268
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,040
you have to keep in mind that hey if

1269
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,240
you're if you are going to change the

1270
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,920
password and use something complicated

1271
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,520
now i have to do it for all 10 000

1272
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,280
devices and it has to be the same thing

1273
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,040
has to be a group password again from a

1274
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,880
secure perspective not a great design

1275
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,640
but sometimes you have to work within

1276
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,760
the limitations of those devices as well

1277
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,920
so again virtually every organization

1278
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
has hundreds if not thousands or even

1279
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,680
tens of thousands of these types of

1280
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,079
devices there's often finger pointing

1281
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,000
when it comes to cameras well i thought

1282
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,839
facilities took care of that no i

1283
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,599
thought i t did no i think it was

1284
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,520
supposed to be security and it's kind of

1285
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,800
like spider-man right they're all

1286
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,040
pointing at each other it just

1287
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,280
it it's just very

1288
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,480
commonly

1289
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,400
um targeted

1290
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,079
and they tend to be very easy to take

1291
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,720
advantage of and on the consumer side

1292
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,319
again we're not focusing too much on the

1293
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,960
consumer side here but one of the most

1294
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,319
popular cameras on amazon last year most

1295
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,400
popular camera highest rated you know

1296
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,920
approved this and that

1297
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,680
shipped with malware already installed

1298
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,720
on it

1299
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
so it wasn't some esoteric device that

1300
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,200
you probably wouldn't come across

1301
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,119
so now let's get into star wars and what

1302
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,040
we can learn from star wars as it

1303
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,480
relates to mitigating uh the risk for

1304
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,319
iot devices i think there's some some

1305
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,240
good lessons learned here

1306
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,400
so the first thing is discovery we need

1307
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,200
to

1308
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,280
know what we've got if we want to be

1309
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,119
able to remediate these risks you can't

1310
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,040
remediate without discovery so discovery

1311
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,319
is very important

1312
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,400
and there are some old school ways

1313
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,480
that have been done historically to

1314
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,560
address discovery that aren't horrible

1315
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,000
but they don't really scale that well

1316
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,079
for iots take end bad solutions which

1317
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,079
are you know off of some span port

1318
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,720
sniffing the traffic most iot traffic

1319
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,480
thankfully is encrypted

1320
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,920
um

1321
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,280
so if you're sniffing the traffic and

1322
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,319
all you're getting is encrypted data

1323
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,160
you're not getting very much information

1324
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,760
plus the information that you can glean

1325
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,000
from sniffing a device it might tell you

1326
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,319
i'm a printer or maybe even even on my

1327
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,319
hp printer but it's not going to get

1328
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,839
down to the detail that you need a

1329
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,400
version model firmware or the dynamics

1330
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,480
of the credentials services etc that you

1331
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,240
need if you want to do remediation

1332
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,920
knowing that something is a printer

1333
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,160
isn't a very good gauge

1334
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
so the end bads tend not to work that

1335
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,119
well

1336
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,040
also legacy vulnerability scanners

1337
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,119
things that are really designed for it

1338
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,119
such as the qualis the tenables the

1339
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,880
rapid seven they're great at what they

1340
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,400
do but usually they work by sending

1341
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,920
malformed packets when they're trying to

1342
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,400
do discovery which is fine with it with

1343
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,480
iot if you send a malformed packet

1344
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,160
especially on the ot side of the world

1345
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,280
where you really don't want to be

1346
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,200
scanning most of the time you can knock

1347
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,520
that device offline which

1348
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,040
impacts availability of course because

1349
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,400
it's offline has all sorts of other

1350
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,800
ramifications so that's not a great

1351
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,319
approach for iot

1352
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,480
a lot of inventory discovery systems as

1353
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,359
well

1354
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,119
they'll just look at the mac

1355
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,040
more specifically the first three octets

1356
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,880
the oui the organizationally unique

1357
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,560
identifier

1358
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,800
of that mac address and when they do

1359
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,119
that it says oh you're a jet direct you

1360
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,560
must be this

1361
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,720
well that doesn't work great in iot

1362
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,400
there's a lot of false positives because

1363
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,319
that mac identifier could be the same

1364
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,119
for a printer or for a phone

1365
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,560
or for a voice conferencing system or a

1366
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,000
million other things in between so

1367
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,839
there's lots of false positives with

1368
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,720
that so it really doesn't work very well

1369
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,920
so some alternatives are like enterprise

1370
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,400
iot security platforms and some of the

1371
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,319
things that they do is they can do

1372
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,640
something like a very short port scan

1373
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,079
check out some various ports and then do

1374
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,400
a banner grab to kind of get a level set

1375
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,280
of

1376
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,560
hey here are here are some of the

1377
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,079
devices on the network that look like

1378
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,400
they might be iot devices or they can

1379
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,240
jack into these n-bats and vulnerability

1380
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,480
scanners and other asset inventories to

1381
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
kind of create that jumping-off point

1382
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,640
they say okay in your environment we

1383
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,680
think there's probably around 50 000 iot

1384
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,480
devices based on the scanning and based

1385
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,560
on these integration pieces but then it

1386
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,960
goes to the next level which is called

1387
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,480
interrogation

1388
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,960
so this is the part where it's like c3po

1389
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,720
instead of bombarding it with malformed

1390
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,119
packs trying to sniff devices what we're

1391
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,480
actually doing in this case is we're

1392
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,640
speaking the language of that device in

1393
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,160
its native tongue

1394
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,520
so you're talking to the printer the way

1395
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,440
it wants to be spoken to you you're

1396
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,920
talking with the kvm switches the

1397
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,160
gunshot detection device the elevator

1398
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,119
shaft

1399
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,960
hvac systems whatever they are in that

1400
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,640
language right

1401
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,720
and based on doing that you're doing

1402
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,880
interrogation either authenticated or

1403
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,800
unauthenticated to glean all those

1404
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,680
details firmware serial number uh what

1405
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,520
they're running etc

1406
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,119
and that allows you to scale because now

1407
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,880
very quickly you're ascertaining what

1408
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,599
these devices are that i have with a

1409
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,599
tremendous amount of detail

1410
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,720
and

1411
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,960
the cool thing about this is

1412
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,359
you have a unique identifier so as as a

1413
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,920
device switches from wired to wired list

1414
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,599
well the mac address changes but so does

1415
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,760
the ip so you're not pegged to that ip

1416
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
address or that mac address you're

1417
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,800
actually fingerprinting that actual

1418
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,440
device based on its scalability of its

1419
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,240
capabilities so being able to speak the

1420
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,559
language of the devices is really really

1421
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,480
critical and there's a lot of complexity

1422
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,160
and subtlety that has to happen behind

1423
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,000
the scenes but from your perspective

1424
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,440
you're essentially just running a scan

1425
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,880
and letting it do its interrogation of

1426
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,280
those devices that's why enterprise iot

1427
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,400
security platforms are really so popular

1428
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,920
now i've discovered all these devices i

1429
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,000
want to look at hardening and upgrading

1430
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,200
these devices so they're not on

1431
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,440
vulnerable versions of firmware

1432
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,839
so again back in the day

1433
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,960
a lot of people say well i'm just going

1434
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,559
to throw everything on a vlan

1435
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,559
well that's nice and i don't think vlans

1436
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,839
are bad i think they're a good approach

1437
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,359
but the problem with that is again you

1438
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,200
have three to five iot devices for

1439
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,319
employees

1440
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,599
you probably don't even know what you

1441
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,520
have so trying to put everything on a

1442
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
vlan first of all is technically

1443
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,720
challenging

1444
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,160
to scale that but it also can be

1445
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,240
extremely expensive and we're talking

1446
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,079
millions of dollars in this approach to

1447
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,839
be able to vlan all those devices and

1448
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:28,960
you're still going to miss stuff and

1449
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,520
there's still going to be

1450
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,359
misconfigurations now at the end of the

1451
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,800
day the worst part is you're not fixing

1452
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,480
it it's like saying oh i just cut my

1453
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,319
hand so instead of going to the doctor

1454
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,520
and getting stitches i'm just going to

1455
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,440
put a plastic bag around it well i'm not

1456
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
getting blood on my other hand so that's

1457
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,559
good

1458
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,839
but at the end of the day i still have a

1459
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,079
cut hand in a bag that's kind of what

1460
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,240
what v landing is like you still need to

1461
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,160
fix that device you still want to make

1462
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,440
sure that the firmware and the

1463
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,079
credentials and everything are secure

1464
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,559
so once you find these devices with

1465
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,880
these enterprise

1466
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,800
iot security platforms you can harden

1467
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,720
them you can say look run ssh don't run

1468
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,960
clear text protocols run wire don't run

1469
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,800
wi-fi don't run bluetooth or bluetooth

1470
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,520
low energy ble shut these things off now

1471
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,680
push those out to all my printers or all

1472
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,440
printers of this version or everything

1473
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,680
in building a so you can do hardening so

1474
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,440
that's good so that reduces the attack

1475
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,599
service down greatly the next part is

1476
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,160
firmware well it has to be agentless

1477
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,920
because you can't put agents on iot

1478
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,359
devices that's one of the one of the

1479
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,200
reasons that traditional it tools don't

1480
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,079
work

1481
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,559
so you need this centralized agent list

1482
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,880
structure such as an enterprise iot

1483
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,720
security platform that can in an

1484
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,880
automated way go out

1485
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,160
and upgrade the firmware on these

1486
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,839
devices and usually the way that works

1487
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,880
is uh these devices these enterprise iot

1488
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,559
security platforms they run on-prem

1489
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,200
usually or from a cloud like a private

1490
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,800
cloud like amazon for example most of

1491
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,640
them have been dockerized and they run

1492
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,480
from these environments and they have

1493
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,119
all the firmware old and new sitting in

1494
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,880
like a google cloud it's all been

1495
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,319
cryptologically checked some both

1496
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,599
communication is encrypted they've been

1497
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,640
verified so you've got all these

1498
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,559
verified firmwares so you don't have to

1499
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,000
hunt the firmware for this device and

1500
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
that device and that device multiplied

1501
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,559
by 50 000 try to find it then go ahead

1502
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,079
and upload it to the device and figure

1503
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,760
out how do i actually communicate with

1504
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,839
this device how do i have to upload it

1505
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,119
it's a nightmare it could take you an

1506
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,760
hour or more per device easy

1507
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,200
with this model

1508
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
that firmware is in the cloud if you

1509
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,599
want to update 5000 printers at once or

1510
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,680
during some change management window or

1511
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,040
everything in building a today and

1512
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,960
building b tomorrow however you want it

1513
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,400
makes it very easy

1514
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,760
and in some cases you want to even

1515
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,839
downgrade it you go oh well i'm on

1516
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,000
version 5 of my firmware but version 5

1517
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,839
has a log for j vulnerability the vendor

1518
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,040
knows they're not going to have version

1519
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,119
6 for three more weeks but maybe i've

1520
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,720
got to go down to version 3 for now

1521
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,640
because that didn't have log for j so i

1522
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,000
might want to downgrade that just

1523
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,599
because log4j is in the news and

1524
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,040
everybody and their sister is running

1525
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,800
these attacks right now so that can

1526
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,280
cause a problem so being able to upgrade

1527
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,760
and downgrade firmware is a huge gain

1528
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,200
once i discover the device the first

1529
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,480
thing i want to do is make sure it's on

1530
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,400
the latest version of the firmware and i

1531
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,040
have to be 100 accurate you don't want

1532
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,760
to turn a 2 million dollar mri device

1533
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,079
into a 500 printer so that's why

1534
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,400
accuracy is so key when you're doing

1535
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,800
this type of analysis and furthermore

1536
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,640
when you're doing the firmware some

1537
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,160
devices let you jump from version three

1538
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,720
of the firmware right to version six

1539
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,400
some devices say you have to go three

1540
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,480
then four then five then six

1541
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,920
that's why during the discovery phase

1542
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
and that interrogation that c-3po

1543
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,960
process that we talked about

1544
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,880
communicating the native language you

1545
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,640
don't just get the information about the

1546
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,400
device but all the supporting

1547
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,319
intelligence about how these how are

1548
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,839
these devices upgraded what's the

1549
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,880
process what are the capabilities

1550
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,319
the next thing is managing credentials

1551
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,800
inserts so i found the device

1552
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
i've got the firmware locked down now i

1553
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,160
want to address these credentials these

1554
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,480
default credentials so a lot of these

1555
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,400
enterprise iot security platforms will

1556
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,960
integrate with pam tools uh cyberark

1557
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,839
hashtag uh phycotic tools like that and

1558
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,280
during discovery they can even

1559
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,200
automatically enroll these devices in

1560
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,240
the pam which is pretty cool

1561
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,760
and when you're doing this you can set

1562
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,000
policies you can say look for all these

1563
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,760
devices i want to rotate the passwords

1564
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,400
every 30 60 90 days i want these

1565
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,240
passwords to be complex i want them to

1566
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,160
be 20 characters long well just like

1567
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,000
with the firmware knowing that upgrade

1568
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,960
path

1569
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,800
the enterprise iot security platform

1570
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,319
needs to know hey you know what this

1571
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,559
thing only takes a four digit pin

1572
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,400
or this device can use upper and lower

1573
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,480
case but not special characters or this

1574
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,240
device can't use a hyphen or the letter

1575
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,319
b we've seen all sorts of crazy things

1576
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,400
in this world

1577
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,839
but knowing that you can create these

1578
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,000
policies again based on that device

1579
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,440
because you've done that interrogation

1580
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,359
you understand what that device can do

1581
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,119
just like with the firmware now you're

1582
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,880
actually applying the same concept to

1583
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,440
credentials which is really nice

1584
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,040
and then the same thing can be applied

1585
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,119
to certificates as well because just

1586
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,720
like not knowing where the device is or

1587
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,319
what firmware or password usually the

1588
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,720
certs are problematic it's on like tls

1589
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,960
version 1.1 it's maybe a self-signed

1590
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,760
cert it expired a long time ago so by

1591
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,119
integrating with those systems you're

1592
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,880
actually able to

1593
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,839
validate and ensure that the certificate

1594
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,240
are strong as well on those devices

1595
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,480
so i found the device

1596
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,880
i've hardened it i fixed the firmware

1597
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,480
i've got the credentials and the

1598
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,839
certificates working great everything's

1599
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,440
humming along and i want to make sure

1600
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,760
that thing that's working now

1601
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,680
is working tomorrow and working next

1602
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,480
week next month next year in perpetuity

1603
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,160
we call that environmental drift things

1604
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,319
always happen right things that were

1605
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,079
working stop working things can be

1606
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,760
hacked things can just break there's

1607
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,599
mechanical fatigue there's all sorts of

1608
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,920
problems that can happen in it and iot

1609
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,599
we all know that so if you have an

1610
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,440
automated way of interrogating just like

1611
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,599
during the initial interrogation usually

1612
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,400
best practices to have a daily test from

1613
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,640
your enterprise iot security platform

1614
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,000
that's going to go out and talk to your

1615
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,559
devices once a day or maybe one building

1616
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,480
a day or one region a day however you

1617
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,319
want to break it up to make sure that

1618
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,599
they're working the way they're supposed

1619
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,400
to work

1620
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
if all the senate says hey

1621
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
you were on version six of the firmware

1622
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,480
but now you're back to version three or

1623
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,079
you did have a password that was managed

1624
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,960
by cyberark or something but now it

1625
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,160
looks like it's back to a default

1626
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,760
password or the password was changed and

1627
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,000
the pam tool didn't change it because

1628
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,559
the enterprise iot security platform has

1629
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,640
to act as that intermediary between the

1630
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,040
pam and the iot devices because pams

1631
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,599
can't talk to iot but enterprise iot

1632
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,839
security platforms can talk to iot and

1633
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,359
can talk to pam

1634
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,720
so because of that it has all that

1635
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,040
notion of state or somebody walked by

1636
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,640
and committed an insider

1637
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,079
threat attack you know with a paper clip

1638
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,920
if you take a paper clip and you walk to

1639
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,000
the back of a lot of iot devices there's

1640
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,599
a little black reset button and if you

1641
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,359
depress that it sets everything back to

1642
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,359
the default firmware default password

1643
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,160
then it's called a paperclip attack

1644
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,240
so if these paperclip attacks are

1645
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,000
committed it's going to drop these

1646
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,440
things back down and there could be a

1647
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,280
valid reason for resetting a box right

1648
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,559
or it could be malicious but you don't

1649
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:53,839
know at the time

1650
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,440
now because these enterprise iot

1651
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,040
security platforms are integrated with

1652
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,160
tools like splunk and servicenow and

1653
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,839
demisto and other types of management

1654
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,680
tools and ticketing systems

1655
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,760
you're made aware by exception so you

1656
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,480
could have 50 000 devices but now you're

1657
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,079
aware that hey but it was this one

1658
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,200
device

1659
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,359
or these five devices that changed today

1660
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,680
or this week that i need to focus on

1661
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,880
right now

1662
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,240
those are the ones that i need to

1663
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,640
address and that's powerful that allows

1664
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,400
you to scale so when you talk about the

1665
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,160
ability of an automated platform to

1666
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,240
allow you to scale and address a really

1667
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,440
vast complex iot network that has

1668
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,280
multiple communication protocols and

1669
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,640
hundreds of different ways to upgrade

1670
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,240
firmware and all these different things

1671
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,599
going on

1672
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,760
now you can actually do it

1673
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,280
now you can actually manage that those

1674
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,359
passwords those firmwares and monitor

1675
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,680
those devices to make sure that nothing

1676
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,079
malicious has actually occurred or there

1677
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,920
wasn't some type of fault so again

1678
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,440
really really powerful capability of

1679
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,200
having both monitoring for that

1680
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,760
environmental drift and insider threat

1681
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,200
and then integrating with all the tools

1682
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,280
that you're using on the it side

1683
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,799
so you have your alerting through your

1684
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,200
sim through your ticketing system

1685
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,960
through your source systems things of

1686
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,520
that nature

1687
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,920
and then finally reporting

1688
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,720
so

1689
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,000
you're doing all this great stuff with

1690
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,839
all your iot devices but now i need

1691
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,319
regulatory or policy compliant reports

1692
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,240
that kind of show me where i stand i

1693
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,000
want to know one can you just tell me

1694
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,760
how many devices i have

1695
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,119
of what device type and version

1696
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,559
and grab all that information tell me

1697
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,599
firmware

1698
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,280
um values what firmware's end of life

1699
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,119
what devices do i have actually enrolled

1700
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,599
in my pam maybe i have 50 and i'm

1701
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,200
shooting for 90 by the end of the

1702
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,960
quarter so you can track that

1703
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,559
um services

1704
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,400
do i have do i have telnet turned on or

1705
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,319
ftp or tftp

1706
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,319
um what type of cves do i have how many

1707
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,799
devices do i have that have level 10

1708
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,040
um cvss scores

1709
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,799
right or how many do i have that are

1710
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,640
eight or higher and then i want to break

1711
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,160
it up maybe based on models show me all

1712
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,640
my cameras okay show me all my access

1713
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,960
cameras great show me all my access

1714
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,200
cameras that are firm or older than two

1715
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,799
years so they can get really really

1716
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,799
detailed so having that

1717
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,480
those built-in reports is extremely

1718
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,440
powerful piece and then finally

1719
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,960
you might want to have all of that

1720
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,160
reporting capability piped out via api

1721
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,400
into some of your existing

1722
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,559
reporting tools that you're using for it

1723
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,880
so that's really really common so these

1724
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,559
enterprise iot security platforms

1725
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,000
generally speaking

1726
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,920
are going to have an api capability to

1727
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,440
integrate all that reporting data out so

1728
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,720
you don't have to have a separate report

1729
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,760
for iot a separate report for it things

1730
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,280
can be integrated again it's all about

1731
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,280
scalability it's all about making sure

1732
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,720
that

1733
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,799
this isn't going to take a lot of extra

1734
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,319
time because there's a lot of devices i

1735
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,480
mean you might have more iot devices and

1736
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,079
you have it devices that you're trying

1737
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,160
to manage but you don't want to stack on

1738
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,160
more and more tools but you do want more

1739
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,400
and more capability

1740
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,200
so to summarize

1741
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,000
you know iot devices they're virtually

1742
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,760
always vulnerable

1743
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,640
i wish

1744
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,160
i wish there was another another way to

1745
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,400
say that it just sucks hence the title

1746
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,000
of the presentation

1747
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,680
um historically it was really hard to

1748
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,839
just find these devices just say i don't

1749
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,119
even know what i have i know i got a

1750
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,720
bunch of cameras and some door locks i

1751
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,000
think and

1752
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,280
lights out management i hadn't even

1753
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,200
thought of that but just finding them

1754
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,960
that's that's a problem then the next

1755
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,880
step of course is once they're found

1756
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,880
remediating the risks which is the

1757
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,319
bigger part of the equation right i just

1758
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,240
don't want to find it i want to fix that

1759
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,000
and then i want to keep it fixed

1760
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,079
right so that's really important

1761
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,440
and now there's solutions to help with

1762
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,599
this right enterprise iot security

1763
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,359
platforms

1764
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,880
somewhat of a newer concept in this

1765
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,799
world and i put a couple versions down

1766
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,160
here of course this is something that

1767
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,599
phosphorus does but we're not the only

1768
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,839
people that plan iot security you can

1769
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:42,880
take a look at some of these other

1770
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,319
vendors everybody has a little bit of a

1771
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,000
different approach to this some a little

1772
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,599
bit more legacy some a little bit more

1773
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,040
modern

1774
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,400
but now these tools can help you

1775
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,160
discovering the device and what

1776
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,240
vulnerabilities are on my device

1777
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,920
updating my firmware

1778
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,760
uh managing those credentials and those

1779
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,160
certificates and hardening those devices

1780
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,599
and then what's really critical is

1781
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,440
integrating with all my other it

1782
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,079
security tools for logging

1783
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,559
for soar capability for ticketing

1784
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,400
systems and then being able to pull all

1785
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,760
that together with a reporting

1786
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,040
capability

1787
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,799
that makes this

1788
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,280
easy for me to manage at scale if you're

1789
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,119
able to do this not only are you able to

1790
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,760
sort of discover your iot environment

1791
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,920
and lock it down but you're able to do

1792
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,359
it at scale

1793
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,280
with these automated tools and make

1794
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,720
these devices secure you're just not

1795
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,960
hiding them off in a vlan just not

1796
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,119
closing your eyes and hoping nothing bad

1797
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,319
is going to happen

1798
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,319
you're greatly reducing the risk on your

1799
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,839
organization with something that's very

1800
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,040
easy to do

1801
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,200
in most cases running discovery from

1802
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,680
these enterprise iot security platforms

1803
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,680
is like running a vulnerability scan

1804
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,440
right the firmware is just kept up there

1805
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,240
you don't have to go hunt for the

1806
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,640
firmware yourself the integration api

1807
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,079
