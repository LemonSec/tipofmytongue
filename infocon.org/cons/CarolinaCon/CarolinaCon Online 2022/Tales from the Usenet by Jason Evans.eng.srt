1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,080
tales from the usenet at carolinacon

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,559
online too

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,480
let's start with a little a little about

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,120
me my name is jason evans i am a

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,440
training engineer for susa linux

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,600
i am also a board member for the usenet

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,119
big eight management board and we'll

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,640
talk a little bit about what that means

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
in just a moment

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,640
i'm a volunteer for the tour project i

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,519
do tech support like new user help on

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,080
forums like reddit and stack exchange

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,599
i'm not an official

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,640
part of tour project but i do volunteer

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,120
i attend meetings sometimes i do

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,640
like the project and what they're doing

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
so i try to be a part of that

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,879
and i'm an all-around nerd i've got a

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,239
lot of different weird nerdy interests i

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,680
used to live in a triangle i lived in

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,640
the triangle for 15 years from 2000 to

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
2015

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,920
and then i got the chance to move to

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
europe where i am now in prague czech

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,879
republic

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,280
so let's begin with what is usenet

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,199
the simplest term i the simplest

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,360
definition i could find was usenet is a

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,720
decentralized worldwide peer-to-peer

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,880
system for circulating newsgroup

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
articles on newsnet we call

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,520
messages articles you know get it news

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,880
articles

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,040
it has grown somewhat chaotically from

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,200
the very big small beginnings

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,119
mostly as a labor of love most people

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,360
who use usenet now do it because they

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
want to right there aren't that many

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
people who get paid for using that use

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,960
or anything

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
there are some companies out there that

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,720
still provide using that service but

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,880
for the most part people who use it are

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
there because they want to use it

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
it is the original long-form messaging

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
service system that predates the

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
internet as we know it now back in 1979

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
whenever they first

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
set up the first usenet

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,439
devices

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,159
um there was no use it was no internet

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,920
there was the arpanet which was a

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,079
government us government program

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,439
but there was no internet

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,799
now we come

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,360
to the more interesting definition of

57
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,040
usenet

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,878
ned is like a herd of performing

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,878
elephants with diarrhea

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,680
massive difficult to redirect all

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,879
inspiring

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,319
entertaining

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,640
and a source of mind-boggling

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,879
amounts of excrement when you least

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,959
expect it and that's from gene spafford

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,640
back in 1992.

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
uh 1992 time frame is what i would

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
consider to be

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
probably the golden age of usenet and

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
that's something that we're going to

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,480
talk about today

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,040
so how does it work users

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,280
read and send articles that is met

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
messages on a new server that server

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
exchanges articles with other new

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,440
servers across the usenet across the

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
network the collection of servers is

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,239
known as the usenet so there is no

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,800
top-down structure to use now whatsoever

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
everything is peer-to-peer it's all

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,760
peer-to-peer messaging

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
so let's begin with a little bit of

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
history in 1980

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
there was no internet there was only the

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,879
arpanet and few had access

86
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,200
from the stories that i've read at the

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,720
time

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,599
most

89
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,200
universities and research institutions

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
didn't even have arpanet access you

91
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
needed to have political connections

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,599
as well as a substance substantial

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
amount of money to even get those those

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
those um those connections uh two of the

95
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,239
schools that did not have

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,360
access to the arpanet would be duke in

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
unc

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,480
the email has been around

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
so we needed something that was better

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
than email email's been around since

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,080
before

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,480
um the use net at the time you could

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,760
send messages to another person on the

104
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,120
same machine especially if you're using

105
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,560
a mainframe or if you're using a mini

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
computer where different people had

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,200
different

108
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
um dumb terminals you could send

109
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
messages to each other that would be

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
email

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
but there's no way to really send that

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
to another person on another machine or

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
to another city

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,840
um

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,799
there were a few people had modems um

116
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,120
even like the first used net modems had

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,920
been uh coupled together by you know as

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,060
projects

119
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,239
[Music]

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,680
there was really no way to talk to

121
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,199
people

122
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,918
outside with the uh with the arpanet so

123
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,440
if you had somebody on the arpanet and

124
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,600
they want to talk to somebody who wasn't

125
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
on the arpanet they literally would have

126
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,320
to call them or send them um snail mail

127
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,840
because there's no intern there's no

128
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
interconnectivity

129
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,919
um between the systems

130
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,600
and i'm sure

131
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,199
somebody had like

132
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
hacked together something once once or

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,520
twice i'm sure you know

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,080
there had been you know a few things

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,400
where that happened but by and large

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,919
that wasn't not common

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,759
so let's begin with duke and unc

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,759
in 1979 uh students from duke and un and

139
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,880
unc

140
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,759
um

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,320
had pdp 11 mini computers

142
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,720
um the compute the picture on the left

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,479
is from duke the picture on the right is

144
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,759
from unc

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,039
and

146
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,039
at about that time

147
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,919
the new unix version 7 came out and that

148
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,720
included a command called uucp or unix

149
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
to unix copy now this had originally

150
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
been meant to just send one-off messages

151
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
from from user to user or from machine

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
to machine you know and that could go by

153
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,080
modem

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
but they wanted to have a way to

155
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
actually

156
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,160
have

157
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
multiple messages going out to the

158
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,560
people um there had been things like

159
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,880
mess like like mailing lists before like

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
where you can like send mail to a

161
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,800
mailing list and other people on the

162
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,160
machine can get that and you can have

163
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,039
different

164
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,720
discussion topics

165
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,840
but to be able to actually go from

166
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,800
computer to computer and actually have

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
places where you can just go check your

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,840
messages

169
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,720
and

170
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,120
have multiple machines that would that

171
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,560
would talk to each other not just one or

172
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
two but actually you know

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
three four dozen 100

174
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
different computers talk to each other

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,600
that was something that was different

176
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,199
and this is actually before the first

177
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
bbs's the first bbs's came out in the

178
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,600
early 80s this as it was actually

179
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,160
started as a project in november 1979.

180
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,919
so let's talk about the rise in the fall

181
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,520
of usenet

182
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
so this is this is the beginning in the

183
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
beginning the usenet arc

184
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
achieved rapid growth

185
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,000
hundreds of new new servers were added

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
yearly

187
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
universities and other institutions

188
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,479
wanted to be a part of this network

189
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,160
because they knew that knowledge and

190
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,639
communication is is everything when it

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
comes to growth

192
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,360
so

193
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,639
what happened is in 1980 the

194
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,319
the students from duke had been at the

195
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,800
usenet used nick's conference

196
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
and had presented this usenet

197
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
project they were working on

198
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
and it grew like wildfire after that you

199
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,440
can see by the end of 1980 there were 15

200
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,759
different universities and research

201
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,520
institutions that were on this

202
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,280
and that just exploded from there

203
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
so here is a a logical map of what usnet

204
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,039
looked like in 197 in in 1981.

205
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,639
we can see here there's a few machines

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
here from duke a few machines from unc

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,919
um there were

208
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,639
machines from cornell

209
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,400
from toronto

210
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
uh microsoft is actually on here they

211
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
had their own pdp 11 or

212
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,360
some similar vax

213
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,199
a mini computer that was on here pretty

214
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,919
universities on here

215
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,120
and they were

216
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
part of this this connection where they

217
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,919
were able to send messages to each other

218
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,720
now because this is uh probably on 300

219
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
baud modems

220
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
and

221
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,560
they

222
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,879
and telephone expenses

223
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,319
long distance calling was really

224
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,160
expensive at the time

225
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,470
you had a few

226
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,400
[Music]

227
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
groups like microsoft that had deep

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
pockets that would do

229
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,479
more calling than others so the smaller

230
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,039
institutions probably couldn't afford a

231
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
thousand or two thousand dollars a month

232
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
on telephone bills so some of the bigger

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,120
ones would pick up and actually call

234
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,240
them instead of them calling out um

235
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
and this worked

236
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,960
for this worked for a while um and as

237
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,759
you can see it really blew up especially

238
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,039
whenever

239
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,440
uh land hardline connections started

240
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
becoming more common

241
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
and whenever the internet itself started

242
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,000
coming in where people actually had a

243
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
static connection to an internet without

244
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
needing to

245
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
[Music]

246
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,920
dial to a bunch of

247
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
other users at the same time so let's

248
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
look at that

249
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,320
so this is a map of the usenet in 1993.

250
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,959
so this is you know 13 layers later

251
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,959
um and

252
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,760
all of the black dots are

253
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,519
um our connections

254
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,880
and the um

255
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,000
of servers on the use net we've got

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,040
of course the united states is

257
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
completely covered

258
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
so it's most of western europe but we

259
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,959
also have several in australia

260
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,920
japan south america and because this is

261
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,600
1993 and after the after the fall of the

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,279
soviet union we actually do have

263
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,200
connections here from russia

264
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
from poland

265
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
um and

266
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,920
several of the eastern bloc countries

267
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
so what would happen

268
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,120
how did how did an actual user start

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,480
using usenet

270
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
well during the golden age and they're

271
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,560
in the early 90s before people had like

272
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
home internet access

273
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,800
most users were from again research

274
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,320
institutions universities and

275
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
corporations

276
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,240
um every september new freshmen would

277
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,519
would arrive

278
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,160
in the computer science programs and

279
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,279
other

280
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,320
stem programs and they would be given

281
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,920
their access to usenet but they would

282
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,240
also be inculturated

283
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,880
into how to use usenet you know how do

284
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
you not make a fool of yourself

285
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,279
how do you get along with other people

286
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,680
on this use nothing

287
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
and then in

288
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,079
1993 america online offered usenet

289
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,320
now there had been other commercial

290
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,519
entities offering usenet prior to this

291
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,959
but they were

292
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,279
more difficult to use

293
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,160
they were really focused at the

294
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,240
computer savvy um

295
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,720
users but aol was a general purpose

296
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,920
platform for everybody

297
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,600
if you're as old as i am you probably

298
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,160
remember getting floppy disks and

299
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,720
cd-roms in the mail for aol during the

300
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
90s

301
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
um

302
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,320
with this

303
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,240
with aol's focus

304
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,519
on being

305
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,480
easy to use and for everybody

306
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,440
this enculturation was gone there was no

307
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
now nobody there to tell people

308
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,839
how to

309
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,000
use usenet how to

310
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,360
be a part of the community and

311
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,519
it went kind of crazy

312
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,600
at first it wasn't that big of a deal um

313
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
i've actually read some of those um some

314
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
of those old archives during this time

315
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,079
most of the things where people are just

316
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,760
using bad

317
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
grammar

318
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,640
bad

319
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,519
bad

320
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,959
practice on using that for example

321
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,800
typing in all caps or starting flame

322
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,200
wars and things like that

323
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
that was pretty easy to handle

324
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
because you would say okay hey so-and-so

325
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
this isn't how we do things here if you

326
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,320
want us to work with you you have to you

327
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
know you have to be in line with what

328
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,079
what the standards are for this

329
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,360
community

330
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,839
and and things weren't that bad but this

331
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,279
kind of opened the door for

332
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,120
for users to start using use now all the

333
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
time

334
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,920
without any kind of

335
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
way to learn what it means to be on the

336
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
use net

337
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,760
a few years later um the largest

338
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,720
web-based unit service which was deja

339
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
which was deja was bought out by google

340
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
google then started up google groups

341
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,959
which

342
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,800
provided google's own forums in addition

343
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
to usenet

344
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,600
the problem is that even to this day

345
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,720
google

346
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,079
never put in any kind of spam blocking

347
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,079
so if you wanted to

348
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
um

349
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,839
if you want to comment on youtube you

350
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
need to like log in and do all of the

351
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,480
stuff if you want to spam the entire

352
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
usenet you just need an account you

353
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
don't you don't actually there's nothing

354
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
there to keep you from spamming multiple

355
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
groups with whatever crap that you want

356
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,120
and

357
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,639
that's still going on today right now

358
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,720
the google is the largest

359
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,079
spammer on usenet

360
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
and then things started going downhill

361
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
this is from 2005

362
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,240
aol pulls the plug on their news group

363
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,320
service and this was

364
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,600
not just aol this was actually a lot of

365
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
companies that were doing the same thing

366
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,120
and the reason why

367
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,639
is because

368
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,120
there are two types of news news groups

369
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
there are binary groups where you can

370
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
like get pictures and videos and

371
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,320
software and then there are talk groups

372
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,800
what happened is that the binary group

373
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,599
started being

374
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,480
used for child pornography

375
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,880
and

376
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
a lot of the

377
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,760
isps decided you know what we can't stop

378
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
this usenet thing

379
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
trust me they had tried

380
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,560
their

381
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,959
usenet providers have been sued so many

382
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,399
times at this point

383
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,240
but there's nothing you can do just

384
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
because one server decides to pull

385
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,680
articles

386
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,839
it's a completely peer-to-peer system it

387
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,079
still is

388
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,120
just because there are these issues

389
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
and somebody pulls

390
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
articles from one server it doesn't

391
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,920
affect the rest of usenet the rest of

392
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
usenet can keep on going on without

393
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
affecting without being affected by one

394
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,560
server going down

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,519
so

396
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,320
the isps decided to stop carrying usenet

397
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,720
so you can see here verizon

398
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,839
sprint

399
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,399
um time warner uh all decided to stop

400
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,920
carrying usernet about the same time and

401
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
this is about the same time

402
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,720
that

403
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,399
aol started started dropping their

404
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,440
service

405
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
um and

406
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,519
because people couldn't get a free and

407
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,760
easy way to get to usenet

408
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,839
i think this more than anything

409
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
has hurt usenet

410
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
now there are still free services that

411
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,800
you can go out there and you can just

412
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,760
get an account and use usenet

413
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,839
and there are lots of paid services

414
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,680
where you can do the same thing

415
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,519
but it's not like this it's not the same

416
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,279
thing as having it just a part of your

417
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,480
of your current service where you can

418
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,440
just log in and use it

419
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,519
um sadly a few years later uh duke took

420
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,839
down their usenet server so

421
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
one of the first

422
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
um

423
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,440
computers to actually use usenet was in

424
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,600
duke and duke had been running their own

425
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,360
server for many years

426
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
and then slowly sadly they shut down

427
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,320
their server not long after that this is

428
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
about 20 2009.

429
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
um mostly because people had decided to

430
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,399
use

431
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,440
facebook

432
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,839
reddit and other forums

433
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,279
um and there are good and bad reasons to

434
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,480
do this

435
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
but the biggest problem is that

436
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,079
people didn't want to deal with spam

437
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,079
but

438
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
um but that's you know

439
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,759
that's a discussion that we can have

440
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,560
um

441
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
is spam really that big of a deal well

442
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,360
it's the the whole

443
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,959
reality of using that being that it's

444
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,079
peer-to-peer means that it's up to the

445
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,680
user to block what they don't want to

446
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,959
see

447
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,880
there are moderated groups out there but

448
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,120
there there's not many

449
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,160
so

450
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,759
for the most part it's up to you to

451
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,440
block what you don't want to see rather

452
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
than expecting a moderator to do it for

453
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
you

454
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,399
so

455
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,360
why

456
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
go on use net

457
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,360
and have to block what i don't like

458
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
whenever i can just go to reddit and let

459
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,680
somebody else do it for me until

460
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,279
that person on reddit decides they don't

461
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,199
like you and they block you anyway

462
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,079
so there's no shadow padding on usenet

463
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,639
um there's no outright banning because

464
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,759
they don't like somebody doesn't like

465
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,000
you all they can do is block you

466
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
and if you're if they complain to your

467
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
provider then you just go to another

468
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
provider or you change your name

469
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
on usenet it's kind of like the old the

470
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,759
wild west but it also gave you the

471
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,199
freedom to do what you want

472
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,799
this is the usenet as of

473
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,559
uh 2020.

474
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,799
so it is significantly smaller than that

475
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,959
picture we saw from 1993

476
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,880
but it is still going

477
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,319
and not all of these are

478
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,280
our corporate entities a lot of these

479
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,199
are people like you and i who run their

480
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,439
own servers they're hobbyists they

481
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,880
believe in using that they want to see

482
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,520
it thrive and they keep their servers up

483
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,400
and

484
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
that way we can keep the network going

485
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
um you can't kill the usenet unless you

486
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
take down everything

487
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,559
and even then there's nothing stopping

488
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,840
two servers

489
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
from making connections and starting a

490
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,919
new usernet

491
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,760
if that's just the the reality of the

492
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,840
period of your nature of usenet

493
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,880
so

494
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
how are we bringing things back from the

495
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
dead

496
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,400
in 2014 all of the members of the big

497
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
eight management board these are the the

498
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
people who run ran the

499
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,520
the big eight hierarchies and usenet

500
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
these are the traditional um

501
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,840
hierarchies that have been there

502
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
not since the beginning but they are the

503
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,440
descendants of from the groups from the

504
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
beginning um all of the board all the

505
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,919
members who ran this board stepped down

506
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,160
or they let their membership relapse and

507
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,360
the board was basically dead

508
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,840
without the big eight board no new news

509
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
groups in these hierarchies could be

510
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,559
created

511
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,160
old ones could not be removed and

512
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
changes could not be made to existing

513
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
groups

514
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,159
etc

515
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,640
and then i posted on reddit

516
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,440
in 2020

517
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
a open letter that i had sent to the

518
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,919
board because the board email was still

519
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,039
up

520
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,880
um

521
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,360
and this is and i got a response

522
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,320
um and actually at the same time that i

523
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,200
had posted this um

524
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,120
open letter someone else had actually

525
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,640
written to the board at the same time

526
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
just you know happenstance

527
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
and we actually got together

528
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,880
and we had a meeting with the former

529
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,160
board members

530
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,120
and

531
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
from that point on

532
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,799
uh my colleague tristan miller and i

533
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
became the

534
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
board members for using that

535
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,840
usenet

536
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,919
big eight management board and we also

537
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,679
added in one more person so now we're at

538
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,840
board of

539
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,240
three you just

540
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,760
so we can make changes together and be

541
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,960
able to

542
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
have a functioning board so that's

543
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,679
that's what we're doing right now

544
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,760
so this is our website

545
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,840
we are currently up and running

546
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,720
we

547
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
um have weekly weekly meetings we've

548
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,559
created um

549
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,720
a we created our first new news group

550
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,320
last fall we've deleted a few old news

551
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
groups this year

552
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
and we're looking forward to continuing

553
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
to add new news groups

554
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,280
um make positive changes and also do

555
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,799
outreach like we're doing right now to

556
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,280
try to get people interested in using

557
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,480
usenet again

558
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
we've also got a reddit subreddit which

559
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
is r slash

560
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,559
classic usenet

561
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
and we are

562
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
openly trying to educate people on what

563
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,120
is usenet and how we can get people to

564
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
use it again i think it's important that

565
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
we have a

566
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,000
moderation free distributed chat network

567
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
by being moderation free

568
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,159
well it's not completely moderation free

569
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,159
but it's it's it's

570
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,240
not being centered around a specific

571
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,280
company

572
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,039
or organization

573
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,559
um we are

574
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,840
peer-to-peer

575
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,000
so what one peer does does not

576
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,559
necessarily affect than the other peers

577
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,360
now

578
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
as a rule like if somebody creates a new

579
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,080
news group we try to get all of the all

580
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,640
of our peers to also carry it but it's

581
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,799
not necessary i mean it's not uh it's

582
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,720
not absolute that they will do it but we

583
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,799
have a pretty good track record of

584
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,240
working together

585
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,600
if one

586
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,720
peer decides to start spamming everybody

587
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,120
else we can cut them off

588
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,559
if one peer goes goes dead you know they

589
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,240
decided to take down their server it

590
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
doesn't hurt the rest of the network so

591
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,720
we we think it's resilient and we think

592
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
it's really great when it comes to

593
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,240
dealing with things like censorship

594
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
so this is the noon group that we

595
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
created last fall it's it's

596
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,440
comp.infosystems.gemini

597
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,919
gemini is an awesome project that

598
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,400
basically is a cross between gopher and

599
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,360
the web it's completely

600
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,880
completely secure

601
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,200
but also minimal and that you don't have

602
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
to worry about things like cookies

603
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,159
or

604
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,880
um or other or other things that you

605
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,840
find annoying on the web

606
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,039
so

607
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
i'm not actually a part of this organist

608
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
you know this this project so much i do

609
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,600
use gemini's from time to time but it

610
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
was cool that we actually got to create

611
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,200
a new

612
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,880
news group uh with people who are

613
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,840
interested in using usenet

614
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
so let's talk about some of the stories

615
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
from usenet and that's really what we're

616
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,320
here for today um these are

617
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,559
not in any specific order

618
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,559
um i just want to tell and talk about

619
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,120
some of the stories from usenet to kind

620
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,440
of give you an idea of what it was like

621
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,760
but also some of the weirder things that

622
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,640
happened during our time

623
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,080
we're going to start with probably one

624
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,919
of the most famous stories from usenet

625
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,360
and that is from a grad student in

626
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,039
finland

627
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,440
so in 1991 a finnish grad student by the

628
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
name of linus torvalds was interested in

629
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
designing his own operating system at

630
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,640
the time

631
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,960
some hobbyists were using closed sourced

632
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,559
os that was based on unix called minix

633
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,120
linus wanted to want is his os to be

634
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
free but he promised that it wouldn't be

635
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
big and professional

636
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,720
and here's his article so

637
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,480
um

638
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
he writes i'm doing a free operating

639
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,919
system it's just a hobby it won't be big

640
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,000
and professional like canoe the gnu he's

641
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,760
he's referring to is going to hurt and

642
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
if you know anything about operating

643
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,000
systems it's uh it was never really very

644
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,679
big

645
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,559
for 386 and 486 clones this has been

646
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,480
brewing since april and is starting to

647
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,080
get ready

648
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,480
i like any feedback on things people

649
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,720
like or dislike about minix and my os

650
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,919
resembles

651
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,480
it's some it's somewhat same physical

652
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,799
layout of the file system due to

653
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,120
practical reasons and other things so

654
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,679
this is linus's opening email to

655
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,360
discussing linux

656
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,240
and of course this became incredibly

657
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,760
popular this is the kind of things that

658
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,520
you could you could expect to see on

659
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,400
usenet in 1991. you can see people

660
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,679
talking about new ideas and new projects

661
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,760
while things were much more limited in

662
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,640
that people were on dial-up modems

663
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,039
maybe linus being at the university

664
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,039
probably didn't need to dial up but a

665
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,039
lot of people did

666
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,679
if you wanted to see the newest software

667
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,279
um packages

668
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,960
you would probably come to usenet and

669
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,320
talk and find somebody who's talking

670
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,440
about it if you want to find out what's

671
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,279
kind of happening with unix if you want

672
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,200
to see what's happening with windows

673
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
this would be the place to go

674
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,799
of course it didn't take long for

675
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,120
disagreements to arise andrew tenenbaum

676
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,840
the originator of minix

677
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,480
the non-free unix-like system for

678
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,600
students said that linux is obsolete but

679
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,279
notice how he did it

680
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,200
while the article summer summary is

681
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
somewhat inflammatory saying that linux

682
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,080
is obsolete he gave his reasons called

683
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
why calmly these two threads persisted

684
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
and persisted on usenet for literally

685
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,760
years it was using it at its finest in

686
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,919
these years the signal-to-noise noise

687
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,000
ratio was fantastic

688
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
i would argue that again that the 90s

689
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,159
that the early 90s was the golden age

690
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,240
for usenet that's not to say that there

691
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,919
weren't the case worth it wasn't the

692
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,600
occasional trolling

693
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,039
um and there was a monochrome spam out

694
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,039
there but it was pretty tiny

695
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,559
but for the most part they can say the

696
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,440
conversations were great and people who

697
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
and people who used it respected each

698
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,520
other

699
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
so this is one of the first

700
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,600
funny

701
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
instances of usenet and this is from the

702
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
very early days

703
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,120
this is from this is cramvax

704
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,840
starting in april 1st 1984

705
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,840
there was an article sent out um

706
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,120
from

707
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,039
the soviet union

708
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,440
to use that to to announce that they are

709
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,120
officially on usenet

710
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,640
and i'll leave this up here for just a

711
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,480
moment so you can read it

712
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,600
um

713
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
but it's basically the soviet union is

714
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
saying uh uh someone from the soviet

715
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,880
union is saying yes we have our own

716
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,360
server and now we want to join usenet

717
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,200
at the time most usernet servers were

718
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,799
using um

719
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,600
on usenet were on them terminals at

720
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,120
universities and the servers were

721
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,679
running pdp 11 or vax or other types of

722
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,279
mini computers

723
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,640
and at the time it wasn't really known

724
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,440
it was possible to spoof a user or

725
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,679
complete server cramfax was proof that

726
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,760
it was so this was actually a really

727
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,400
funny joke um that they that they put

728
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
out obviously it's on april fools

729
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,360
and there was a lot of spam a lot of

730
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,320
feedback a lot this was a huge uh flame

731
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
flame war that went on because of this

732
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,840
because people were so upset that

733
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,039
somebody was posting jokes on the usenet

734
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,440
and again this is 1984 so these net had

735
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,200
only been around for about four years

736
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,960
really so

737
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,679
yeah that's this is great um

738
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,400
this is an example of one of the

739
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
responses

740
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,799
and um

741
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,720
i wanted to point out something here at

742
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,840
the very end of this

743
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,960
in the 90s and in the early 2000s

744
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,679
parents and legislators were talking a

745
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,320
lot about internet addiction

746
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
a whole 10 a whole 10 years before the

747
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,039
eternal september and years before the

748
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,039
internet of the web people were already

749
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,400
talking about

750
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,840
um about

751
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,600
why people were taking the use net

752
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,320
taking being on the net as he says it so

753
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,880
seriously

754
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,200
so i i just like this thing i i know

755
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,440
that's the case with some people that's

756
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,320
why the

757
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,480
term nerd applies to computer people and

758
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,080
not to those who spend all weekend

759
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,840
watching tv sports

760
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,320
the real user is how well-rounded

761
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,559
people's lives are flamers should go to

762
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,360
death dave slash shrink please so i i

763
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,440
like this i like the fact that it's it's

764
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,600
sarcastic but it's also

765
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,799
kind of

766
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,720
kind of foreboding about how people

767
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,000
would would see their lives on the net

768
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
years before there even was an internet

769
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
let's talk about cypherpunk cypherpunks

770
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,840
are one of my favorite uh groups on the

771
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,080
on the old internet

772
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,000
and it's from them that we get a lot of

773
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
our security that we have today

774
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
the cypherpunk's mailing list and then

775
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,200
the alt thought cyberpunks news group

776
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,399
was the

777
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,799
home for a group of anti-authoritarian

778
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,279
hackers who cared about online freedom

779
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,559
and privacy

780
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,399
both the news group and the mailing list

781
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,480
were home to individuals

782
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,200
like the early cryptocurrency advocates

783
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
online anarchists

784
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,399
would be folks like the pre-wikileaks

785
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,720
julian assange

786
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,960
as the as the news or ss news article

787
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,039
states the mailing list was originally

788
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,120
started by john gilmore who is a

789
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,279
founding member of the eff for the

790
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,600
electronic freedom foundation

791
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,360
sadly the news group didn't quite have

792
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,279
the punch that the mailing list had in

793
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,679
its prime but it was a step forward so

794
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,200
if this is just a cool little story

795
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,320
about how

796
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,279
um

797
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,880
how whenever they

798
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
the mailing list got shut down the

799
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,120
cypherpunks were able to go to usenet

800
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,000
and still be able to to function as they

801
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,480
had been

802
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,360
so one of the people who was

803
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,520
famous on

804
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,760
on the cypherpunk's mailing list and

805
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,520
also in on the usenet um newsgroup was

806
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,919
tim may tim may was one of the

807
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,960
major

808
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,559
visitors to the cypherpunk's mailing

809
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,799
list and in the news group this was an

810
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,520
example this is an example of an article

811
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,279
that was discussed that was that he

812
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,080
wrote years before the anonymous satoshi

813
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,919
nakamoto

814
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,480
invented bitcoin was nakamoto a member

815
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,760
of these communities

816
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,679
it's impossible to say but these

817
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,200
communities were sentenced were

818
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,679
certainly influential on people like him

819
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,080
or her

820
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
um before we leave the cypherpunks i

821
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,440
wanted to point out one more brief

822
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,919
mention and that is phil zimmerman's

823
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,880
posting of the source code for pgp or

824
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,559
pretty good privacy in 1991 on usenet

825
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,799
without pgp we would not have the

826
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,640
internet security that we know today

827
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,039
at the time strong encryption wasn't

828
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,480
meant to be in the hands of regular

829
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,399
people and it was regulated with the

830
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,440
same kind of legal pressure as firearms

831
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
zimmerman was soon investigated by the

832
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,360
government and the indictment against

833
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,919
him only ended five years later

834
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,480
pgp wasn't hidden away in some scholarly

835
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,720
article on theoretical encryption it was

836
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,600
in the hands of people who needed it

837
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,640
and used it um available on the usenet

838
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,240
so this was actually just the the

839
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,760
beginning

840
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,880
message for that article and it was the

841
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,960
first of five articles and

842
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,360
together this was the

843
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,159
uh source code for pgp and because i

844
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,919
don't want to like have like 20

845
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,000
different slides with with source code

846
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,159
we only get the the beginning here but

847
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,200
it's good to see where that came from

848
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,640
all right let's talk about a few more

849
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
uh this is one unfortunately i couldn't

850
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,919
find the original article on so i just

851
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,320
have to paste what i could find you've

852
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,760
probably heard of imdb before imdb is

853
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
internet and movie database it's a very

854
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
popular website it was bought out by

855
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,399
amazon a few years ago

856
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,440
imdb actually got it started as a set of

857
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,519
unix shell scripts

858
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,440
and they were written by colin needham

859
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,519
who is still the ceo of imdb to this day

860
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,760
the scripts were distributed on the news

861
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,080
group wreck.arts.movies

862
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,120
so back in the day if you wanted your

863
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,159
own copy of imdb you could get it he he

864
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,600
he provided this

865
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,679
free of charge on the use net so this is

866
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,240
just another thing this is 1993 this is

867
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,159
that's still that same

868
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,000
uh same early version of you um of

869
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
usenet before a lot of people were or uh

870
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,519
before a lot of people were on the use

871
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,200
net or before a lot of people were on

872
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,360
the internet i should say so it's really

873
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,039
cool that this was something that was

874
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,840
that was out there

875
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,399
um

876
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,399
another thing that happened during this

877
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,840
time was the alt scientology war

878
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,640
this is an article from wired

879
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,679
that um as i said earlier lots of people

880
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,919
had tried to sue

881
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,080
different use net providers over the

882
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,600
years and one of them was the church of

883
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,760
scientology now i'm not going to talk

884
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,519
here about scientology

885
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,559
and specifically but i will say that

886
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,720
on the internet someone had published

887
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,960
many documents that had been

888
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
copyrighted and owned by the church of

889
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,399
scientology

890
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,600
as a means to

891
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
educate people about what it believes

892
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
and before this point all of this had

893
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,720
been had been like internal secrets to

894
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,640
their church

895
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,960
and

896
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,159
because of this uh scientology this this

897
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,320
church of scientology went a little

898
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,679
crazy with their lawsuits and

899
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,039
against individuals and against

900
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,720
different services

901
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,880
but what they eventually found out is

902
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,159
that it

903
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,600
they couldn't really

904
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,320
put a dent in this because

905
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,840
the usernet being again being

906
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,480
peer-to-peer even if they were to sue

907
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,960
let's say verizon because they had

908
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,399
they had their own new server or

909
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,799
something and they were disseminating it

910
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,960
they would have to sue each and every

911
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,760
new server and that just wasn't going to

912
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
happen

913
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,120
they eventually did get some of the

914
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,320
larger

915
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,600
services to delete those articles

916
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,399
but they couldn't get everybody to

917
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,880
and that's part of the resiliency of the

918
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,360
usenet

919
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,240
all right well thanks for for coming to

920
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,279

921
