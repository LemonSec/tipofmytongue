1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,680
all right

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,560
good morning everyone happy carolinacon

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,000
happy sunday uh this is matt i am here

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,639
with wonky we have been the designers

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,440
for the past three carolinacon badges we

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,560
started with carolinacon 15. we made one

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,320
for 16 but we didn't get to use it with

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,800
the outbreak of the pandemic we made the

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,880
hack the pig badge last year for the

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,519
first uh carolinacon online and then we

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
have designed this badge here

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,558
this is the carolinacon online 2 badge

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,760
let's see

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,360
we have a 555 timer right here

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,320
for the blinking led and the associated

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
capacitor and resistors

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,039
uh we're going to try and have it so

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,600
that the discord general chat is on our

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,239
screen here so we can also field any

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
questions about the ctf

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,360
about the badge itself carolinacon

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,879
anything like that we're happy to go

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
ahead and discuss

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
all right see everything is set up we

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,879
are ready to begin

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,400
so we're going to talk a little bit

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
about how we came up with the design for

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,600
this badge

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,760
so this year we had the theme of

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,159
satellites and we got some art

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,799
commissioned for a satellite logo like

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
this with some leaves growing on it so

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
once we have the logo made we always

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
start our process by starting in a

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,720
vector program called inkscape where we

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
take the logo that the artist gives it

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
and we change it into the associated

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,600
layers

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,520
so if you think of this pcb it's

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,079
actually about like seven layers if you

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
really think about it on the outermost

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,320
layer there is this solder mask that is

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
this blue color you see here

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,399
then beneath that is copper which

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
appears as this silver because i believe

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
they put what is the metal they put on

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,640
that mic i forget what that's called

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,560
something um and then in the middle

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
there is fiberglass which is what makes

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,479
the badge so sturdy

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
and then repeat the process on the other

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,880
side copper and then solder mask again

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
so to actually make this exposed copper

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
here up here we have to first tell the

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
program hey we want there to be copper

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,680
on all the areas here

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,199
and then we have to tell it hey we don't

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,360
want there to be solder mask because by

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
default it will put soft water mask

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
everywhere and that's how we're able to

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
get the exposed copper for the r on the

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,840
front here

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
on the back it's a bit simpler

64
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,599
because this is where we have all the

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
traces for the actual circuit

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
um and because we don't want to mess up

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
the art on the front

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,040
uh yeah so in inkscape once we have the

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,440
art and everything set up we then use a

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
plugin called svg descension which will

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,720
then export this into a file that kicad

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
or kicad depending on who you ask

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
can read and we actually go in

74
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
with all the footprints and everything

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
it has to actually wire up the circuit

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,040
itself

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,480
and that's where we get everything on

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,680
the back

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
uh this year wonky did all the

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,519
handwriting on the back i really love

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,599
this idea i think it's super super

82
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,040
unique so i'm really happy with how that

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
came out

84
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,360
all right without further ado uh we are

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
going to go ahead and start soldering

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599
the badge again i am looking at the

87
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
general chat right now so if anyone has

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,239
any questions about the badge the ctf

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,480
anything at all we can go ahead and

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
answer that i think starting at around

91
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
noon we're going to go over the winner

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,959
of the ctf some closing remarks things

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,080
like that

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,840
but let's go ahead and get started

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
so i am heating up my soldering iron now

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,519
and turning on my little diy fume

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,159
extractor

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
there we go

99
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,319
all right

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,080
so the very first piece we're going to

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,920
solder in is the ic socket for the

102
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,000
555 timer

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,319
is dip eight for anyone that's familiar

104
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,920
because there are eight little holes

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,599
there and dipped because it is a

106
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,680
through-hole component it doesn't just

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
sit on top of the pcb it goes all the

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
way in

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,319
so we just place it in like that

110
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,720
and then we are ready to start soldering

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,480
let me get my iron primed

112
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,160
i'm basically just putting a little bit

113
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
of solder on the iron to kind of warm it

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,880
up to get things ready and then i'll go

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,600
ahead and clean it off

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
all right

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
so i'm going to go ahead and just solder

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
one of the the pads first just to get

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,360
things started

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,720
because i want to make sure that the

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
socket is soldered flat into the pcb

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,919
if you can see it's at a little bit of

123
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,680
an angle right now

124
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,880
and so what i'm just going to do is i'm

125
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
going to push that with my thumb

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
while heating up the one pad that we

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,759
have right there to kind of flat there

128
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,840
we go to get that centered nice in

129
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
position

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
all right

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,039
and now i'll just solder the remaining

132
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,039
pins

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
i'm at a bit of a weird angle with the

134
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
camera here so forgive me this looks a

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
little bit strange

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,800
um some initial ideas for this badge

137
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
were very ambitious we were talking

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
about running kubernetes on this thing

139
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
um by getting some wi-fi enabled chips

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
uh it was some pretty crazy stuff for

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
the design process at first

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
unfortunately with the supply chain as

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,479
it is right now we want to make sure we

144
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,080
could use parts that were easy to

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,560
acquire and this situation all of these

146
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,919
are

147
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,360
so if anyone does go to

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
shop.carolcon.org

149
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,840
you can purchase our merch bundle this

150
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,440
year that comes with a shirt a sticker a

151
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
shot glass and one of these badges with

152
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
all the parts you need to go ahead and

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,360
make your own

154
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,479
and

155
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,319
it is a great way to support the con we

156
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,720
really appreciate it that's how we uh

157
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
you know get the money to run the

158
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,479
servers for the ctf and handle all the

159
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,360
other expenses that we have running it

160
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,400
so

161
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
that socket is in there that's good the

162
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,039
next thing we're going to do is solder

163
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,520
in the three resistors

164
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,319
so

165
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,120
when you use a 555 timer like this

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,440
the two resistor values specifically

167
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,039
these two right here

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,680
are the ones that determine

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,639
how quickly the timer is going to blink

170
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,880
so in this case i wanted a long slow

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,199
blink you know one second on one second

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,840
off and i managed to cheese it by using

173
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
a 220 and a 10k

174
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,720
as a rounded values it's very funny

175
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,000
because after i ordered the parts for

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,319
this i saw a tweet where someone said oh

177
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,639
yeah if you use rounded resistor values

178
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,919
like this it means you didn't do the

179
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,400
math uh and i did not do the math i won

180
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,759
it and it worked

181
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,759
uh so they absolutely called me on that

182
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,720
and let's see

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,440
so right now i'm just getting that

184
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
resistor in place

185
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,759
i'm going to add

186
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,960
the next 220

187
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,719
ohm resistor here

188
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
show off i have one of our black uber

189
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,280
badges right here those are going to be

190
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,800
given away uh as prizes i'm not entirely

191
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,639
sure yet we think the ctf winner is

192
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
going to get one in addition to our main

193
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,319
ctf prize of that meteorite that real

194
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,319
meteorite

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
let's see and now we're gonna add the

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
last resistor

197
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,840
again if anyone has any questions you

198
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,759
can go into the general chat on our

199
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,680
discord or a matrix server those are

200
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,440
both synced together

201
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
and i'm happy to answer that if anyone

202
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
has any questions about

203
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,759
the badge the ctf or anything else

204
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,360
that's going on before we announce the

205
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,400
ctf winners coming up

206
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,559
all right

207
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,679
trying to get

208
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,760
that in there it should be good to go

209
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,679
uh both both wonky and i uh we are we

210
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,760
are not electrical engineers by trade

211
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,800
this is

212
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
all self-taught it's all just out of our

213
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,680
own uh you know desire to work with this

214
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,560
stuff

215
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,399
so it's it's always very interesting

216
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,000
seeing our approach to it and the

217
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
official approach whenever we come

218
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,040
across it

219
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
but now that those resistors in place i

220
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
can just

221
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
add a little bit of solder to the back

222
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
of each pad here

223
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,160
and look at that those are some good

224
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,160
connections

225
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
all right

226
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,440
all right

227
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
you guys can take a look

228
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,959
good connections there

229
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
so i'm gonna go ahead and cut those off

230
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
i don't have my good snips for this so i

231
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,200
have to kind of use these wire strippers

232
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
to do it awkwardly so forgive me if this

233
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,839
isn't the prettiest uh the prettiest

234
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,160
trimming

235
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,720
yeah i can't get those as short as i

236
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,160
really want them to be

237
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
but that's fine we'll just bend them

238
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,399
over for now and then when i do get my

239
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,880
better snips at home i can go ahead and

240
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,279
cut these shorter

241
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,480
what oh my gosh thank you

242
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
ask and you shall receive

243
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
so now i've got the good snips here we

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
go

245
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,959
look at that all right

246
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,920
so now we can see all those resistors

247
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,800
are wired up right

248
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,560
there try and have them blend in with

249
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,839
the artist here

250
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,680
all right the next piece we are going to

251
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,720
solder in is the led this is polarized

252
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,560
so you can always tell the negative end

253
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,560
of an led by looking at the shorter

254
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,720
pin bit of wire i'm actually not sure

255
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
what that's called but the shorter one

256
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
is always negative so we can just insert

257
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
that into the pcb right here

258
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,959
i'm going to do the same thing i did

259
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
with the ic socket where i'm just going

260
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,880
to solder one of the legs and then i'm

261
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,320
going to straighten it out with my

262
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,240
finger before i solder the other leg

263
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,480
there we go

264
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,800
just enough solder in there

265
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
and i'll show you what i'm doing if i

266
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,279
can here

267
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,600
i'm just heating up that little bit and

268
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
then with my thumb

269
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
i'm going in and i'm straightening it

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
out

271
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
there we go now the led is

272
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,399
mostly not crooked it's still a little

273
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
bit of it there

274
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,519
nothing i'm gonna try and fix that

275
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
there we go that's about right

276
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
and now just to finish off

277
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,519
those pads right there

278
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,959
there we go

279
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,959
i always tell people don't be afraid to

280
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,040
put the iron right on the pcb you want

281
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,279
to heat up the pad so the solder flows

282
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
right to it you don't want to worry

283
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,800
about uh you know trying to hot glue

284
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
dribble the solder onto the circuit

285
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
that's never going to work to form a

286
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
good connection

287
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,399
all right let's go ahead and get the

288
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,040
capacitor

289
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,160
this is 120 microfarads

290
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
um

291
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,279
picking capacitors

292
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,120
is tricky because

293
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,680
there's a million different kinds and

294
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,920
it's always always fun to try and figure

295
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,519
out which one is the best one for this

296
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,240
particular project from the price from

297
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
the actual size to

298
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,720
uh you know constraints on is this

299
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,800
component in stock and will you be able

300
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,399
to get it in time for the con all of

301
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
that fun stuff

302
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,600
the other thing is they really absorb

303
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
heat i have to leave the iron on that

304
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
for a bit more than usual just because

305
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,920
they will suck up so much of the heat

306
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
and take away the heat from the actual

307
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,639
pcb where we need it to be

308
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,120
looking at that that's soldered on great

309
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,800
so i can get the other lead the other

310
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,399
leg there

311
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,839
capacitors also uh polarized so

312
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,000
we have to use the shorter leg here and

313
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,120
the negative spot on the pcb

314
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,560
there we go

315
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,680
that

316
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,560
looks pretty good to me

317
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,760
go ahead and trim that now

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,079
okay

319
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,079
all right things are coming along well

320
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,399
we are almost done the last piece we

321
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,480
have is the battery pack

322
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,959
so let me go ahead and get that

323
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,399
double a batteries are a little bit

324
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,399
overkill for this project they'll power

325
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
this one led for i think it's a week or

326
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,839
so it's it's a very long

327
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,120
time uh

328
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
this is the double-sided adhesive that

329
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,639
we use

330
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,920
uh

331
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
to adhere the battery pack to the pcb we

332
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
bought this last year for the carolina

333
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
online batch for ten dollars and this is

334
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,480
still how much we have left we expect to

335
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,160
be able to use this for many years to

336
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,279
come

337
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,839
and in the process we had to learn the

338
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,120
official 3m data c data sheets and

339
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,199
levels for adhesiveness because the

340
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
stuff we bought originally wasn't sticky

341
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,639
enough and so we had to like go through

342
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,720
their process to find out what is their

343
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,480
stickiest roll and this is it

344
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
so i am just

345
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,079
putting the double-sided adhesive on the

346
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,880
back of the battery bank

347
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,399
removing

348
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,959
this actually i want to cut the power

349
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,800
wires to length

350
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,440
uh before i peel off the adhesive and

351
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,560
stick it

352
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,199
so in this case the wires are very short

353
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,360
for this badge that's because we want to

354
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
make this badge a little bit smaller

355
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,240
than

356
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,639
usual

357
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,079
so here i'm going to cut the wire to

358
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,199
length

359
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,480
and just remove just a smidge

360
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,959
of this sheathing to expose the wires

361
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,720
whenever you have this multi-threaded

362
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,959
wire like this i really don't want to

363
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,279
cut off too much because you can easily

364
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,480
fray

365
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,959
in a lot of situations

366
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,479
all right

367
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,880
now i'm just going to go ahead and twist

368
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,000
the ends here and then bend them down so

369
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,240
they will stay in place in the pcb when

370
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
i want to solder them

371
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,440
and now remove the adhesive backing

372
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,920
go ahead and center this onto the badge

373
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,479
itself

374
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
perfect

375
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,920
that's not going anywhere

376
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,399
and i left a little bit of extra room

377
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,880
for these wires that might make it a

378
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
little bit tricky to try and solder them

379
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,639
in place here but let me go ahead and

380
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,759
bend them

381
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,759
and get those ready to solder right now

382
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
there we go that that could work that's

383
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,000
going to stay in place

384
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,800
all right let me go ahead and solder

385
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,199
that in place

386
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,040
here's the one component where we're

387
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,519
gonna burn the sheathing on the wire

388
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,959
just a little bit

389
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,600
um it's pretty much impossible not to

390
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,639
but that's okay that's okay

391
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,000
there we go we've got a pretty good

392
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
solder connection there

393
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
all right now repeat the process for the

394
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,319
black wire

395
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,039
oh it's being a little bit tricky it

396
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,120
doesn't want to stay in

397
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
well that's fine

398
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,520
that's fine maybe i just

399
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,720
convince it a little bit

400
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
a little bit of convincing we'll get it

401
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,280
there

402
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,840
let's see

403
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,799
there we go a little bit of convincing

404
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,360
for my other hand

405
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,120
there we go

406
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,240
now just to finish up that joint

407
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,160
there we go

408
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,240
all right that's not a bad connection

409
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,400
not the worst i've ever seen

410
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,640
let me go ahead and cap that off on this

411
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
side

412
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
perfect

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
all right and with that we have fully

414
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,720
assembled this year's bash let's go

415
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,840
ahead and pop in a battery and give it a

416
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,080
try so first let me get the last

417
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,000
component the 555 timer

418
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,280
there's a circular notch in the top of

419
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
this one we want to line that up so it's

420
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,160
facing up on the badge

421
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,160
all right that goes in the socket just

422
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
like so

423
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,280
and now i've got some spare

424
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,440
aaa batteries

425
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,400
hey it worked on the first try

426
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,240
we can now see the antenna on the side

427
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,960
light here is blinking that nice steady

428
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
red every one second

429
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
all right just like that this year's

430
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,840
badge is pretty simple to assemble that

431
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
took what was that less than 20 minutes

432
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,039
to get that done

433
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,720
and everything is working great

434
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
okay

435
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
well thank you very much for listening

436
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,360
uh again badges made by myself matt and

437
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,320
wonky

438
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
we're very happy to answer any questions

439
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,919
