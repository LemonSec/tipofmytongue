00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,520
mine don't necessarily reflect my

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,720
employer standard disclaimer um although

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,360
uh obviously there's there's a lot of a

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,920
lot of overlap there given uh

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
given what we've what we've done at the

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
company

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,359
a little bit about myself

andrew clinton

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,199
18 years in the greater i.t space past

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,119
10 to that heavily focused in security

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,560
roles

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,519
held a wide range of positions windows

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,558
linux security sysadmin type physicians

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,160
security engineering

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,800
pen tester consultant pciqsa for a few

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
years i've worked as director of

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
security for now two separate companies

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
currently i'm director of cyber security

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,000
on healthcare

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
hold uh

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,719
too many certifications um some of which

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,399
i'm happy with some

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,680
yeah all right

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,480
uh

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,960
college dropout and uh i've got lots of

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,399
expensive hobbies that i don't really

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,840
have time for

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
and the great example is right there at

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,078
the bottom

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,400
and i want to talk a little bit about my

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
team because we're kind of

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
gearing up for

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,720
you know how to go beyond purple i think

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
i need to talk about my team first and

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,759
i'd avion i'm fortunate that

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,119
both

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,280
both divisions red and blue report up to

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,759
me now my my team is

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,960
is kind of

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
kind of think is roughly divided into

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,240
instant response and vulnerability

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
management it's a whole lot that gets

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,640
fit into that incident response side you

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
know sim engineering and security

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,560
engineering

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,280
threat hunting

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
and of course incident response as well

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,439
vulnerability management tends to

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,560
encompass all of our internal

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
vulnerability scanner scanning external

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,159
vulnerability scanning

52
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
penetration testing

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,720
um as well as uh kind of facilitating

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,399
and coordinating you know third-party

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
assessments and third-party penetration

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,280
testing so

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
definitely a strong mix of red and blue

58
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,320
but we're all on the same team so

59
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,479
heavy heavy focus on collaboration no

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,360
silos within my group

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,878
um

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,920
everyone's kind of involved and uh and

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
everyone works together it's it's a

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
great scenario

65
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,560
um

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
you know we're on the same stand-up

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
calls every morning

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,239
you know our

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,640
sprints are are in alignment

70
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,360
um we perform frequent purple team

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
operations and sometimes i think i think

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,720
uh i think of purple team operation it's

73
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
almost on the scale of a pen test it's a

74
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,040
bigger thing

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
or any kind of red team does their stuff

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
and then then they go back to blue and

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,519
have a conversation about it that's not

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,080
really how we operate the our purple

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
team offs are

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
kind of smaller in scale but far more

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
frequent far more iterative

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,760
um

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
so we've got a monthly cadence but it

84
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,239
goes beyond that you know lots of lots

85
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,599
of collaboration

86
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,679
between both sides of that equation

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,040
you know

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
red team works with blue to

89
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
to validate security controls and kind

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
of make recommendations

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
and blue team works with red it's a it's

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
a great two-way relationship that has

93
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
led us to a lot of quick maturity over

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
over the past couple of years

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,360
so beyond purple

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,120
what do we even mean by that

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
oh kind of

98
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
baseline here

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,519
when i say purple i really mean

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,920
you know enhanced information sharing

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,319
between red and blue teams okay that

102
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,720
collaboration that

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,080
kind of shares perspectives and leads to

104
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,319
increased effectiveness if

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,519
a uh

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,000
if a defender has a better idea of what

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
an attacker is doing you know they're

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
going to have a better way of better

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
understanding how to defend against it

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
and vice versa attacker understands how

111
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,840
defenders working that they can tune

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
their attacks to tailor it to the

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
environment and tailor it to the

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
situation

115
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,519
and kind of drive those results further

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,239
maximizing effectiveness

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,319
and

118
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,760
getting getting the most out of that

119
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
relationship

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,238
uh

121
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,478
in this talk i want to kind of cover

122
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,560
taking that philosophy of sharing

123
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,120
understanding sharing information

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,919
and

125
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,080
and i want to expand it outside of

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
security i want to take it and talk

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,800
about

128
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
things we've done at avianna

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,360
a couple of scenarios where we've worked

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,080
with teams outside of security to

131
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,880
to increase communication to to do more

132
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
knowledge transfers and to uh to break

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
down communication barriers and

134
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
and drive more effective results and

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
broader understanding

136
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,040
um i want to say across the organization

137
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,240
but the

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
over

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
some of the

140
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,160
the the examples we'll step through with

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
some specific teams so it's it's

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
definitely a heavy focus for us

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
we want to

144
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,960
want to make sure that everyone's

145
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639
talking everyone's working with each

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,800
other and that uh

147
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
you know we're kind of increasing

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
understanding across the board so so i

149
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
mean in short this this is a this is

150
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
talk about talking to people

151
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,520
i hope everyone is excited

152
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,320
a couple of key points i want to talk

153
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,120
and touch on um

154
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
you know i think i think some of the

155
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,759
real significant advantages some of the

156
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,440
the things we've been able to achieve

157
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,039
with

158
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
with the

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
with kind of the the actions you've

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,520
taken

161
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,240
across these these kind of cases i'll be

162
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
stepping through showing no new

163
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
perspectives to people

164
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,199
um kind of taking theory and turning

165
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,639
into reality for for some

166
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,199
two-way knowledge transfers is a big one

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,240
getting

168
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
getting separate teams to talk and

169
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
and walk away with a deeper

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,199
understanding is huge

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,280
sometimes barriers go up

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,919
silos get established and document much

173
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,199
communication get through and then

174
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,160
you've got

175
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
you know independent teams doing their

176
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
own thing and

177
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,440
that can be detrimental

178
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,039
so

179
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
and again

180
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,919
breaking down barriers encouraging

181
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,759
communication yeah i think there's a

182
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,680
short-term aspect of that and then a

183
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
long-term aspect of that

184
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,199
so

185
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,560
sometimes you just get some friction

186
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,319
that happens between teams and they're

187
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
not talking as much as they should

188
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
how can we work to approach that and

189
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,240
encourage more communication so that

190
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,039
there's you can avoid uh animosity or

191
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,800
friction and then you know what can we

192
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
do from a long-term communication

193
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
standpoint because that i think that's

194
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,400
where real collaboration comes into play

195
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
so i want to acknowledge a couple of

196
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,160
challenges um

197
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,440
there's there's a lot of companies out

198
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,319
there that struggle with cross-team

199
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,639
collaboration i've seen it firsthand

200
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,680
i've heard

201
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
heard stories from from other colleagues

202
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,759
um i think

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,160
one of the things that uh that stands

204
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
out to me a lot is dialogue teams you

205
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,919
get teams working independently of each

206
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
other they kind of everyone's got their

207
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,560
own specialty so there's some natural

208
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,440
tendency to to move in the direction of

209
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
silos you know kind of leave me alone

210
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,840
i'm working on i'm working on my thing

211
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,720
um

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
but uh but that can be detrimental you

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
know it kind of kind of leads to echo

214
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,479
chambers and

215
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
and uh and not really understanding what

216
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,800
other teams are doing another another

217
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,639
issue is uh communications being

218
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
filtered through leadership sometimes

219
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,400
senior leadership doesn't want to

220
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,039
it doesn't want engineering talking to

221
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,400
engineering

222
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
um division of duties fees into that and

223
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,479
then sometimes corporate culture just

224
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
isn't really facilitating of uh open

225
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
communication and there's a lot of

226
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,240
impacts to this as well

227
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,919
and this is kind of a short slide

228
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,560
covering some high level items but the

229
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
misalignment of goals you know if we're

230
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
not talking to each other we don't know

231
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,919
what each other's doing and

232
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,800
maybe

233
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,479
maybe i'm working on a project that

234
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,479
you're working on and

235
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
and uh

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
if we're not talking to each other about

237
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,840
it we're we're not working towards the

238
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,479
same goals in the same way and that can

239
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,120
be

240
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
that can decrease efficiency and kind of

241
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
harm the overall

242
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440
the overall product

243
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
now first in between teams

244
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
you know if you're not talking about

245
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,680
relating to your fellow co-workers yeah

246
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,160
sometimes hostility can can kind of

247
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
start to grow

248
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,000
um if uh if it's just status updates hey

249
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,159
you finished that thing for me yet um

250
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
that can

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
that can lead to

252
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,559
lead to animosity and and friction uh

253
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,399
lost communication isn't a big one maybe

254
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,160
you're just not talking yeah i think

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,000
that sees in the barriers

256
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
as well and then

257
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,360
then already touched on outright

258
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,839
hostility and stonewalling

259
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,560
you know security keeps pestering me so

260
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,839
i don't i don't want to talk to them

261
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,200
anymore yeah they can go talk to my

262
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,399
manager if they walk across me

263
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
um

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,320
as we kind of step into

265
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
before we get into the the specific

266
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
stories i want to touch on uh the

267
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
prerequisites i think in

268
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,200
my current position current company

269
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
we're very very fortunate in our

270
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
corporate culture and

271
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,040
you know our our leadership has enabled

272
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
you know this sort of scenario where we

273
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,800
can have that a stronger crossteam

274
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,519
collaboration but as i've touched on in

275
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,160
a couple of previous slides

276
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,800
um that's not always the case so i think

277
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
there's a few prerequisites i wanted to

278
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,839
touch on here

279
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,920
you can't have any leadership barriers

280
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,640
we don't want any any any vps or

281
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
directors standing in the way of

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,880
communication uh toxic personalities and

283
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
then we won't we all experience it from

284
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,640
time to time we all run into

285
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,560
that guy that's really challenging to

286
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
work with yeah you get to get one too

287
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
many of those and can

288
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,160
damage communication all around

289
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
we

290
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,279
another prerequisite everyone's kind of

291
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,880
working towards the same goal you know

292
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,480
whether they're aware of it or not i

293
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,399
think i think this is generally the

294
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
situation you know working in a company

295
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,320
um your goals tend to be aligned across

296
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,519
the board

297
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,279
but uh

298
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
um but it's definitely

299
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,560
definitely something you might keep in

300
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
mind and then i think finally uh the

301
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
last prerequisite here is probably the

302
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,480
most important

303
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,720
time a lot of us get overworked over

304
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,399
stressed

305
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,360
but

306
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
you know the the hard fact about trying

307
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
to increase communication is you need

308
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,160
more time for uh meetings and emails

309
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
and

310
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,720
that's thrilling as that sounds um it's

311
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,480
kind of

312
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,360
part of the experience here and uh yeah

313
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,440
maybe in short this this worked in my

314
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,360
company this is this has worked for us

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
and worked really well for us happy to

316
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,839
share these stories but may not be

317
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
perfect for every single scenario

318
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,320
so

319
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,160
it's four stories i'll be kind of

320
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,680
talking through today

321
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,959
um

322
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,399
this is the first one here is kind of a

323
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
quick one and this picture is actually

324
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,600
the uh the only real picture in the in

325
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,120
the slide deck the rest have been

326
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,720
swapped out for random entity or kind of

327
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,600
keeping

328
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,560
keeping

329
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,640
confidential details you know away from

330
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
the slide deck but this this is our

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
senior pen tester

332
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,480
conducting a wireless bed test portion

333
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
of it anyway

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
pointing a yagi internet at our

335
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,040
corporate headquarters way across the

336
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,000
street

337
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,040
um at the in context for this the story

338
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
um

339
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,519
was i believe this q1 of last

340
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
were we were performing an internal

341
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,279
wireless pen test there wasn't a whole

342
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,000
lot a whole lot going on there

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,079
wireless network was pretty secure not a

344
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,440
lot of vulnerabilities it was an

345
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
interesting pen test

346
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,519
but uh but not not a lot of exciting

347
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,760
things so we we did some

348
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
we did some initial testing discovery

349
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,800
mapping

350
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
and kind of figuring out uh

351
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,279
you know

352
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,959
what what access points were where what

353
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,560
wireless devices where would this

354
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
consistently consistency look like

355
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
throughout the company did some

356
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,200
preliminary attacks

357
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,079
but

358
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
i think the real real key thing that we

359
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,079
decided to do here that had a huge

360
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,920
impact was we we scheduled a

361
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
collaborative session

362
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,399
with network engineering and uh and the

363
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,040
defensive security engineering team to

364
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,959
do a collaborative kind of i want to

365
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,240
call it a workshop but it was really

366
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,839
more of a demo and screen share

367
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,800
and

368
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
and so we

369
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,279
we scheduled a meeting and i think it

370
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,560
was maybe an hour long um

371
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,519
it wasn't too bad but uh scheduling the

372
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
meeting with with the networking team

373
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,200
and the the

374
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,279
the defensive security team

375
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,000
allowed us to to fire up a fire up

376
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
screen chairs and show

377
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,360
show what everybody was doing show

378
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
everybody's perspective for this

379
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
particular thing and the scenario where

380
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,880
you know wireless attacks are being

381
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,800
performed on our network and what what

382
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,079
is the

383
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,440
what does the wireless system look like

384
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,880
so it was just a

385
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,639
off the internet screenshot of uh i

386
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,959
think cisco meraki air marshall you're

387
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,440
showing rogue ssids the networking

388
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
team's perspective this when they log

389
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
into their equipment this is what they

390
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
see they know that they they can detect

391
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
rogue ssids rover access points they

392
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,279
know that they can detect attacks

393
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,360
and uh yeah but

394
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
yeah

395
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
it doesn't doesn't happen a whole lot

396
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,839
so

397
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,600
so most of the time there's not not much

398
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
to look at here

399
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
um but being able to have there have

400
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
their system on the screen while the

401
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
pentester performing live attacks and

402
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,959
generating info is kind of kind of cool

403
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,440
to see you see the board light up

404
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,320
and

405
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
see okay well pentester's doing this and

406
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,760
i'm seeing that it's a good experience

407
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,880
um

408
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
then we're going to dip back into a

409
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,959
little bit of purple here we also had uh

410
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,320
also had the defensive security

411
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
engineers on the line

412
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,839
and that kind of allowed us to

413
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,839
to uh to watch event generation or

414
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,079
alarms you know what how does the system

415
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,440
react you know

416
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,199
the rogue access point is stood up do we

417
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,680
actually get do we actually get an event

418
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,120
can we how can we validate those

419
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,519
controls

420
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,079
um and then

421
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,760
and then of course the pen testers were

422
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,839
able to do the screen share as well and

423
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,680
i think this was this was a real

424
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,160
eye-opening moment this was really cool

425
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
to see um and i think a lot of fun for

426
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,720
the network engineering team

427
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,000
you know because

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,160
said they they've got their interface

429
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,199
they conceptually know that uh hey their

430
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,600
their system detects rogue access points

431
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,560
or

432
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,199
or you know or those sorts of things and

433
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
potentially detecting the authorization

434
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,880
packs or

435
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
or uh you know any you know malicious

436
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,839
activity the uh the wireless intrusion

437
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,680
detection system does

438
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,000
does quite a bit but um but how are

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
those attacks performed how you know

440
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,079
what does that look like

441
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,839
most of them had never never seen it

442
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,800
never

443
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
never touched it

444
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,920
um never seen it performed in front of

445
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,839
them so this was a great experience it

446
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,240
wasn't pre-recorded it was it was all

447
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
live it was hey i'm gonna fire up a

448
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,079
remote access point you know we're in

449
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,839
the middle of the corporate office

450
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,399
tell me what the wireless system does

451
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,720
and um so it was kind of an eye-opening

452
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,800
moment here changed changed theory into

453
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
reality for uh for the network

454
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,399
engineering team

455
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,000
um we got a lot of a lot of great

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,560
questions throughout the session

457
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,480
uh just kind of talking about how

458
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,279
attacks are performed you know what uh

459
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,720
what we should work out and what we

460
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
should look out for and it was a good

461
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,800
conversation overall

462
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,720
uh

463
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,880
story too um

464
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,079
in this uh

465
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,040
this this kind of scenario we had uh we

466
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
had an internal web application with

467
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
with multiple vulnerabilities standard

468
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,759
fantastic discovered them remediation

469
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,399
was pretty quickly queued up and and

470
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
development started working on it

471
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,399
but one thing we were a little bit

472
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,720
concerned about was um it was always a

473
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,639
business attack we didn't

474
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
we weren't getting any resistance to

475
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,959
to deploying

476
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,440
deploying remediation or updating the

477
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
application we were working closely with

478
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
the development team and making good

479
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,839
progress

480
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,680
but we wanted to

481
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,199
we knew that the

482
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,880
the business owners of the application

483
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,399
and the users they application were

484
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,720
going to be impacted with a smaller

485
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
group of internal users

486
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
and we wanted to

487
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,399
we kind of wanted to show them what was

488
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
going on and

489
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,839
and why we're doing what we're doing

490
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,279
so

491
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,040
yeah we scheduled another kind of live

492
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,160
demo

493
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,880
um the live interactive session i mean

494
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,560
30 45 minutes uh it was pretty quick

495
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,519
um

496
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,199
and we uh we pulled up the report and we

497
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,799
stepped through the findings this was

498
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,199
really illuminating and again changing

499
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,280
kind of theory into reality

500
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,839
um and the business owners know you know

501
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,880
understand that hey there's

502
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,039
vulnerabilities in the application

503
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,319
and uh

504
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,880
and they need to be fixed but

505
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
it's completely different to see it

506
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,599
and so in in this scenario

507
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
our senior pen tester

508
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,240
was able to

509
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
um

510
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,559
our senior penthouse knows i'm sorry for

511
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,280
the

512
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,600
pause here

513
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
technical difficulties in my own um so

514
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,039
in this scenario our senior senior pen

515
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,960
tester was able to

516
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
was able to uh step through the findings

517
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,360
and really

518
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
really demonstrate uh yeah what what the

519
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
results would be

520
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,160
you know

521
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,480
what could be done with

522
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,200
with these uh with these issues

523
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,280
um and so again kind of changing that

524
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
theory into reality

525
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,440
um it's one thing to be told that

526
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
there's vulnerabilities on your web

527
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,039
application but uh but it's another

528
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,360
thing to see uh see a pen tester fire up

529
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
sql map and dump sensitive records right

530
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
there in front of your eyes

531
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
and and you know this was a technical

532
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,120
demonstration for for non-technical um

533
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,600
business leadership but uh but it still

534
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
had a substantial impact it really kind

535
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
of showed them hey this is why we're

536
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,400
doing this this is why we go through

537
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
these efforts this is why we we test for

538
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,080
vulnerabilities and why we're working

539
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,760
towards remediation this is why your web

540
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,280
application is going to be down for a

541
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,039
day or two as we're pushing out upgrades

542
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,039
story number three here

543
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,360
senior engineering meetings

544
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,080
last year we kind of had a we had a

545
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,000
pretty pretty substantial workload on

546
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
both the security and the infrastructure

547
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,679
side

548
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,559
um as we were working through some some

549
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,640
heavy-handed compliance goals across the

550
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,280
board it was uh there's a lot of work

551
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,080
being done and there's a lot of a lot of

552
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,919
projects that are somewhat intertwined

553
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,640
and

554
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
this particular situation that kind of

555
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
spawned this discussion was uh

556
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
um we had we had security engineering

557
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,760
waiting on infrastructure to complete

558
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,200
some of their projects and we had

559
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
infrastructure waiting on security to

560
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,160
complete some of their projects and in a

561
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,000
remote work environment yeah

562
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,640
what that kind of translates to is

563
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,440
the

564
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,640
security

565
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,320
agile sprint is you know a week long the

566
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
infrastructure agile sprint is two weeks

567
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
long and so once a week security emails

568
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,720
infrastructure and said hey you finished

569
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,240
that thing for me yet

570
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,520
and uh

571
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,760
and so twice throughout their

572
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,919
their uh their sprint cycle

573
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,679
infrastructure is getting getting

574
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,280
nuisance emails

575
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
um and then

576
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,520
vice versa is somewhat true as well you

577
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,240
know

578
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
the infrastructure teams look into

579
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,240
security hey did you did you finish this

580
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
thing yet did you finish those

581
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,320
dashboards in the sim for us yes and um

582
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,679
when that's all the communication that's

583
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,600
happening friction starts to build up

584
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
yeah no i'm

585
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,679
waiting on so-and-so it's been weeks

586
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
it's been weeks

587
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,919
and then i'm waiting on him to do this

588
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,360
thing for me and he keeps pestering me

589
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,799
about this other thing

590
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
and uh it really is a breakdown of

591
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
communication it was yeah everyone had

592
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,600
their their heavy workloads and so

593
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
they're kind of focusing on their own

594
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,679
work

595
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,400
and not understanding the perspective of

596
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,200
the other individual and not necessarily

597
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,520
blaming anyone for for this scenario

598
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
it's just kind of

599
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
an emergent property of kind of hey we

600
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
all had a lot of work and we're all kind

601
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,799
of pushing each other to

602
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,400
you know trying to get to the next step

603
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,039
the answer was pretty obvious we we need

604
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,480
to increase the communication between

605
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,559
some of these guys

606
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,520
so

607
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,919
so we established a standing meeting um

608
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,480
between infrastructure and security

609
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,919
engineering

610
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,840
um

611
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,880
and

612
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
there wasn't there wasn't a set there's

613
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,159
no set uh agenda there's no sets goal

614
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,640
it's just it's a bi-weekly cadence

615
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,760
um somewhat in alignment with uh with

616
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
agile sprints because that kind of lines

617
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
up the projects and updates and keeping

618
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
vms happy

619
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,559
but uh no managers just senior engineers

620
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,000
senior engineers know how to talk to

621
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
senior engineers i don't need to be

622
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,039
involved here

623
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,039
um these guys are all working towards

624
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,320
the same goals

625
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
and they just need to

626
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,919
you know they just need to chat and make

627
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,720
sure that you know they're not kind of

628
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
making make sure that the communication

629
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,080
between these teams is more than just

630
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,559
status updates and you know hey you

631
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,400
finished that thing for me yet

632
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,360
um so this is a this is actually an

633
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
ongoing standing meeting i think we're

634
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,720
still getting fantastic results out of

635
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,400
it you know even if it's just

636
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,240
encouraging communication between the

637
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
teams you know so

638
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,559
they they get into these uh

639
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,720
these bi-weekly meetings and

640
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
i think sometimes there's a little bit

641
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
of an agenda there's projects on the

642
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,600
board that need to be discussed you know

643
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,280
sometimes i think the conversation's

644
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,440
more casual you know what you're working

645
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,280
on this week yeah you know we're all

646
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
technical

647
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
um both both sides of engineering and

648
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,360
focus on technical tasks everything's

649
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
interesting you know what what's the

650
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,679
cool project that's in the pipeline but

651
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,280
that also kind of

652
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,880
gives them an opportunity to talk about

653
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,799
what's what's on the horizon what are we

654
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,919
going to be working on in a couple of

655
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,200
months or what are the ideas we're

656
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,480
playing around with

657
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,280
it's helped us get ahead of uh some some

658
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,480
challenges

659
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
you know where uh where security may be

660
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
rolling out a project that's going to

661
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,880
have a more substantial infrastructure

662
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,799
impact we need we need to deploy a new

663
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,520
ids system and that's that's gonna

664
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,280
that's gonna take you know three server

665
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
deployments

666
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
well that's an impact infrastructure you

667
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
know we can discuss it in these meetings

668
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
so that you know it's on their radar as

669
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,880
soon as possible and there's some

670
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,720
preliminary discussion that kind of

671
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,440
eases some of those tensions and uh and

672
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,520
increases efficiency overall

673
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
and then uh of course you know how can

674
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
we help each other out

675
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,520
there's been some great examples of

676
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,840
between these two teams over over the

677
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
past couple of years

678
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,120
you know there's tools that they use

679
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,280
that infrastructure uses that that can

680
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,520
help us and there's tools that security

681
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,240
uses that can help infrastructure and

682
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,159
you know where does that overlap and and

683
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
how can we how can we increase that

684
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,039
collaboration

685
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,000
and i think

686
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,159
another point i kind of wanted to make

687
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,120
here

688
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,320
and

689
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,400
with the first two first two

690
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
um scenarios it's kind of kind of

691
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,880
standoff or standalone

692
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,000
uh scenarios one-off meetings this is

693
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,760
more this is a cadence

694
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
and i think as you

695
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,440
kind of talk through implementing these

696
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
or you know

697
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,799
having these meetings

698
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,320
you know you're having a long-term

699
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,840
effect you're you're opening up

700
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,120
communication

701
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,559
you're you're encouraging more

702
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,919
communication

703
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,720
um

704
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,360
so this this is this one in particular

705
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,080
this bi-weekly cadence is is a big one

706
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,320
it kind of gives that that conversation

707
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
space but even in the previous two

708
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,240
you're encouraging on ongoing

709
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
communication even though it's not just

710
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,840
the one-off meeting you know with

711
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,919
with the business owners and users of an

712
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,320
application suddenly they know security

713
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,799
exists and they know what security does

714
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,320
and so they're going to be more likely

715
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,120
to pick up the phones than that email

716
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,600
and uh ask questions later on and you

717
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
guys did that session you know three

718
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,159
months ago can we do another one because

719
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,240
i want to better understand

720
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,039
you know

721
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,880
what's going on over here or can we can

722
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,799
we talk through some things or you know

723
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,080
we just implement implemented

724
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,039
multi-factor on this application

725
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,679
why

726
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,240
might be uh some really valid use you

727
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
know questions from users

728
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,640
that uh want to make sure that

729
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,799
that security has an open door and that

730
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,480
people are comfortable approaching us

731
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,440
and

732
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
kind of we want to foster that long-term

733
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
communication so that we can collaborate

734
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
collaborate with

735
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,559
you know all the different teams across

736
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
the business and uh

737
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,080
and have a more effective result

738
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,919
um it's a this is a bigger bigger story

739
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,240
but kind of my favorite

740
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,000
saved it for last

741
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
um pen testing and development

742
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,640
integration so last year we had the

743
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,679
we had we had an external party do a

744
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
into a pen test for one of our

745
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,440
applications one of our internal

746
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,919
applications and they came back with i

747
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,279
want to say it was an overwhelming

748
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,720
amount of findings but there was plenty

749
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,919
of findings

750
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,600
some of them were fairly complex and

751
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
some of the the complexity here had to

752
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,679
deal with legacy code issues

753
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,760
standard challenges that a lot of us run

754
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,880
into

755
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,799
um but uh

756
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,480
you know

757
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
we um we were pretty quickly we

758
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,000
established resources and and budget and

759
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
secured

760
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,240
secured the budgeting resources required

761
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,640
for remediation and tied that to a

762
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,080
timeline um somewhat aggressive timeline

763
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
you know there's a variety of risks in

764
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,120
play

765
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
uh

766
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
with the application

767
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,240
but uh but really we just kind of wanted

768
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,480
to make make sure that we processed you

769
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
know this hearty list of

770
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
vulnerabilities you know in an effective

771
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
manner so i think how do we do that

772
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,840
we've got like some some complex

773
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,760
vulnerabilities that

774
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,520
that are a little difficult to explain

775
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,039
understanding how they interact with

776
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,360
back end code is a challenge because

777
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,840
legacy code that's not necessarily being

778
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,240
um not not necessarily the most

779
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,320
exercised by by the current development

780
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,000
team so how do we bridge some of these

781
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,520
knowledge gaps

782
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,200
and uh you know make sure that the

783
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,720
developers understand the attacks

784
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,200
understand the security implications

785
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,799
and those scenarios

786
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,240
um and

787
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,880
how do we cue up effective remediation

788
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,480
and

789
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
work in a reasonable timeline so we can

790
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,400
we can meet the deadline and

791
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,440
move on to other projects well

792
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
have the pentesters and devs hang out

793
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,080
hang out a lot

794
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,520
so

795
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,440
stepping into the the remediation

796
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,520
process and

797
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
single slide covering months worth of

798
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,480
work

799
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
um

800
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,120
we uh

801
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,440
yeah after commuting after discussions

802
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,880
with the development teams and

803
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
leadership

804
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,760
and kind of the best way to approach

805
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
this we uh we integrated

806
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,080
the pen testing team into into the

807
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,399
development teams and so pentesters

808
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,640
joined the daily daily stand-ups and

809
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,399
weekly sprint planning from uh

810
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,240
development teams and

811
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,039
and uh pentesters joined the the

812
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,480
development slack channels because

813
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
that's where most of the development

814
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,440
communication was going on

815
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
and yeah i don't want to i don't want to

816
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,279
understand the the impact here we've got

817
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,360
several development teams each with

818
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
their own set of stand-ups and and

819
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
sprint planning

820
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
yeah that's a that's a huge burden for

821
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,760
you know a short list of pen testers

822
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,159
it's a lot of that's a lot of new

823
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,200
meetings every single day but uh

824
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,480
but the team did a great job

825
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,559
and this this really

826
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,240
threw open the firehouse in terms of

827
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,480
communication between the teams

828
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
you know the

829
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,840
pentesters were heavily involved

830
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,360
understanding you know

831
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,399
what

832
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,120
how things are being prioritized what

833
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,279
what fixes were being worked on there's

834
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,000
active communication between developers

835
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,799
and and planetary pen testers

836
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,600
to

837
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
talk about hey we're looking at

838
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,520
implementing this as a fix for for this

839
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,279
vulnerability what do you guys work when

840
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,440
you think about that is that going to be

841
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
effective

842
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,600
um

843
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,520
yeah there's there's a lot of great

844
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
discussion so there's kind of

845
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,080
smaller fixes for more

846
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,240
spot issues and then there were certain

847
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,080
scenarios where we had you know

848
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,360
recurring issues throughout the

849
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,520
application and we needed to discuss

850
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,840
larger fixes that were broader and i

851
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,799
think that

852
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,320
that uh

853
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,480
this relationship really really helped

854
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,240
facilitate those conversations where we

855
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,399
could talk about you know dewey

856
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,440
um

857
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,840
this is not a specific example but yeah

858
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,159
do we uh

859
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,320
you know do we do we run through the

860
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,159
full list of cross-site scripting

861
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,640
vulnerabilities and remediate those

862
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,360
inputs one by one or do we do we try to

863
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,039
find a broader approach that takes care

864
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,600
of everything in one one uh

865
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,399
you know kind of one one file swoop

866
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,760
and uh there's a lot of great

867
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,840
discussions in this time frame about the

868
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,760
pros and cons of different different

869
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,440
types of remediation

870
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,240
and

871
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,960
how how do we approach it and

872
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
you know it was i think it was

873
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
illuminating to the the development

874
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,039
teams you know how the pen testers

875
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,039
operated and

876
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,760
kind of helps help the development teams

877
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,320
understand well if you if you fix it

878
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,799
this way we can still get around the fix

879
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
versus if you fix it that way

880
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,600
that's far more robust and is going to

881
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,200
keep me from getting back in um and and

882
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
vice versa and the

883
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,320
this uh this relationship really helped

884
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
pen testers gain deeper understanding

885
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,760
and we could talk about white box

886
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,799
testing

887
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,399
but uh

888
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,640
but this is kind of goes beyond whitebox

889
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,480
box testing because it's active

890
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,399
communication with the developers

891
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,360
maintaining the code so there's

892
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,279
scenarios where the contest is going to

893
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,120
have questions you know if i if i

894
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,440
initiate this function and you know drop

895
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,279
this input in there you know what

896
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,960
happens on the back end

897
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,760
and

898
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,919
you know they had the direct line of

899
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,159
communication into the the teams that

900
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,559
understood the back end functionality

901
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,600
and uh

902
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
and seeing what the implications of it

903
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,080
would be but to kind of

904
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,960
bring this portion to a close uh

905
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,640
that

906
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
that open communication really really

907
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,279
helped streamline remediation across the

908
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,159
board

909
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,240
it was kind of cool launching especially

910
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
at the tail end as we're kind of getting

911
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,640
into that the remediation validation

912
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,240
phase

913
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,640
if uh if there's so much conversation

914
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,120
happening on the front end before

915
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,080
uh remediations are designed and

916
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,159
implemented well then by the time

917
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,679
they're implemented

918
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,600
you know it's the pen testers already

919
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,360
had eyes on it

920
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,519
the we're confident in the results and

921
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,000
that that final validation step is just

922
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,159
like you can almost instantaneous yeah

923
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,919
no we'll run the check again but we know

924
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,080
that it's you know the validation is

925
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,159
going to be sound and it was is really

926
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,840
kind of cool we're watching the final

927
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,200
couple of months of this project and

928
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,440
we're just knocking out

929
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,799
validation

930
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,600
left and right

931
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,559
but

932
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,399
again constant communication between the

933
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,320
teams really opened this up and kind of

934
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,880
helped streamline all these processes

935
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,600
gave us a much much more robust

936
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,679
remediation end result and uh and really

937
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,360
kind of fostered the relationship

938
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,000
between between those teams that's kind

939
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,880
of

940
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,720
brings me to my next slide

941
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,159
um yeah more buzzword synergy here

942
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,039
um

943
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,480
but uh

944
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,640
that open two-way communication still

945
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,200
exists that uh that project in

946
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,039
particular was a big one but it's come

947
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,880
to a close we wrapped it up at the end

948
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,080
of last year

949
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,200
but the

950
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
development team the security team still

951
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,799
talk all the time

952
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,399
um

953
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,320
you know we'll have a lot of developers

954
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,720
proactively reaching out to security

955
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,159
yeah again via slack via you know the

956
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,399
other messaging the emails

957
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,159
pro meeting on the calendar and we're

958
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,679
about to do this let's let's talk

959
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,600
through it real quick yeah make sure

960
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,720
that uh

961
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,080
make sure that we're doing this right

962
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,679
and that we've considered the attacker's

963
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,440
perspective

964
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,679
and then on the opposite side

965
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,559
our our pen testers um part of the

966
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,080
vulnerability management team and part

967
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,559
of that is uh static and dynamic vote

968
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,240
analysis which kind of

969
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,000
you know ongoing

970
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,399
and having that direct line

971
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,200
you know

972
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,440
not just into the development teams but

973
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,200
to the developers

974
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,840
really helps with that hey we ran a

975
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,480
static code analysis on on this older

976
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,799
application and you know we found static

977
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,039
credentials in this file what's up with

978
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,720
that in developer in in slack in

979
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,039
two seconds oh yeah no that's a

980
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,720
that's that's uh

981
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,039
that that code is no longer in use

982
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,200
um i'll uh i'll tag it in the next

983
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,360
sprint just to delete the file

984
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,159
um

985
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,679
you know we've found situations like

986
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,799
that so it's kind of this open

987
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,640
communication has really

988
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,799
has really helped us out long term in

989
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,720
breaking down those barriers

990
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
establishing that uh

991
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,960
that two-way communication and

992
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,360
you know getting quick effective results

993
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,719
so

994
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,399
i ran through this a little a little

995
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,079
more quickly than i was expecting but

996
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,719
kind of in conclusion you know kind of

997
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,480
touching on my my four key points here

998
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,359
again

999
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,239
you know

1000
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,879
there's there's a lot of benefit to kind

1001
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,719
of fostering this cross-team

1002
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,079
collaboration

1003
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,320
and you know either either having

1004
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,480
standalone meetings or

1005
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,199
you know standing meetings or

1006
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,800
you know integrating

1007
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,000
you know teams within other teams to

1008
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,399
to kind of facilitate more communication

1009
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,079
you can really

1010
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,000
you can really show new perspectives you

1011
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,839
can kind of take that theory into

1012
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,119
reality

1013
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,719
you know so with the first two examples

1014
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,239
pretty confident the network team had

1015
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,639
never seen the aircrack suite you know

1016
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,359
live and running in front of them before

1017
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,599
um you know they conceptually understood

1018
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,000
what what the attacks were but never

1019
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,520
seen them perform so it was an

1020
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
eye-opening experience

1021
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,680
yeah not only hey these are the attacks

1022
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,079
being performed but these are the

1023
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,720
results this is how my system reacts and

1024
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,040
dang the pen tester can do that quick

1025
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,440
um a similar situation in the second

1026
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,240
scenario talking to the uh business

1027
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
owners of the application

1028
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
again hey we have these vulnerabilities

1029
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,400
we need them fixed okay cool you guys

1030
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,839
you guys picked them

1031
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,040
but uh

1032
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,079
um but we wanted to take take the time

1033
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,560
and and show hey this is

1034
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,200
this is why we're fixing vulnerabilities

1035
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,359
you know you can

1036
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,359
this is the this is the impact of some

1037
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,040
of these

1038
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
some of these uh web application

1039
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
vulnerabilities and

1040
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,640
and uh this is how we dump sensitive

1041
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
data over this is how we do cross-site

1042
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,960
scripting and hijack credentials or it

1043
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,359
says why session handling is important

1044
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,000
you know because it has this impact and

1045
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,119
take a

1046
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,079
if you

1047
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,760
have somebody who

1048
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,599
who normally works with sensitive data

1049
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,119
and they think that it's in a confined

1050
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,640
spot and then they show it and then you

1051
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,680
show them

1052
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,720
you know a sql injection attack that

1053
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,800
bypasses all the controls and dumps the

1054
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,400
contents of the database and suddenly

1055
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,480
all that all that information that they

1056
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,320
thought was secure is right there on the

1057
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
screen

1058
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,000
it can really uh it can really

1059
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,280
illuminate

1060
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,520
you know the why you know why are we

1061
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,599
pushing these security initiatives and

1062
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,640
uh

1063
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,240
and

1064
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,280
how does that relate to

1065
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,400
to them as the user of the of the

1066
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
application or or the business owner of

1067
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,000
the application

1068
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,320
and then stepping into the security

1069
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,440
engineering

1070
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
or the uh the engineering senior

1071
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,920
engineering meetings as well as the uh

1072
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
the development and the

1073
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,000
security integration you know breaking

1074
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,280
down barriers and encouraging

1075
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,359
communication is huge

1076
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,240
um

1077
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,000
you know kind of reached a point where

1078
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,760
teams are proactively reaching out to

1079
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,400
each other communication is streamlined

1080
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,599
and

1081
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,560
and it's

1082
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,920
it's fun

1083
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,440
man like

1084
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
you know we're all technical we're all

1085
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,280
interested in the work that's being done

1086
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
and so

1087
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,800
it's it's easy to talk to each other

1088
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,119
once the communication starts happening

1089
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,040
yeah and it's exciting because we all

1090
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,760
get to learn and that's

1091
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,920
the i think i think that makes everybody

1092
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,480
excited about things it kind of helps us

1093
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,440
uh

1094
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,079
helps us queue up new projects

1095
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,599
helps us

1096
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,520
make effective use of everybody's time

1097
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
and i think everybody gets to grow and

1098
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,960
learn throughout the whole process

1099
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,359
all right so that's uh that's my talk

1100
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,880
about talking to people

1101
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,359
