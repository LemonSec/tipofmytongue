1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:01,129
sit

2
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:02,390
pretty hardcore

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,200
uh... market that's me

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,049
uh... my that these security engineering
for uh... consulting form uh... firm

5
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,309
here in raleigh

6
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,529
um...

7
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,799
my personal researcher wireless realm of
technology eh...

8
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:16,899
most the time

9
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:20,309
and um... portable stuff but i used to
say mobile but that's like mobile

10
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:23,229
obviously means fono if nothing else can
be mobile

11
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:25,189
so i have to say portable

12
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:27,649
um which is a lot but we're talking
about today

13
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:33,650
uh... my website where post christmas
stuff whenever get around to

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,420
uh...

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,880
don't take it easy you know you learn

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,719
that for people have income comes before
and stuff you learned a lot of stuff you

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,510
can do

18
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,820
that things were so

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,810
i don't need to say more that's just

20
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,240
sr

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,700
okay so the focus of this talk

22
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,420
basically

23
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,270
leave your computer at home i i realize
this week uh... in labeling attack from

24
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,400
a library

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,050
at the kid

26
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,940
people might think of software library
like that's what that's not the focus of

27
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,850
this all this is this is actually from
mike

28
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,230
well safely

29
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,070
a computer that's not yours

30
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,010
so that's that's the top it's not
actually libraries in the bias is no

31
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,670
coding boxes

32
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,630
uh... so what can you do uh... without

33
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,530
your system that you've got to know your
pre configured

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,369
i've got my desktop earn laptop at the
hearts

35
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,040
event set-up ready go

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,390
what if that's taken away you know you
have to go and heard

37
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,570
well it's on the singer's sides helpful
had you know you're doing a contestant

38
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,690
whatever

39
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,200
uh... you have to go n

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,309
maybe you're doing some social
engineering

41
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:35,920
where he would be awkward type have a
laptop and going up

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,170
for an interview

43
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,050
for you know some sales job

44
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,870
you carry a laptop in the distance aunts
though

45
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,980
some all the way you're going to that

46
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,060
a real world you know it's a scenario
where they want to say somebody comes up

47
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,550
the street millions

48
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,189
uh... incident response

49
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,809
sometimes have to get for a quick you
know if you're out to dinner but you

50
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:56,450
have to respond immediately

51
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,870
and it's not you know at your office yet
the offsite

52
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,820
what do you have on you that you can do
incident spots were

53
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,990
some backup plan

54
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,009
if you're all set to do your assessment

55
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,449
and your hard drive just crapped out

56
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,549
what do you get a deal you know if you
don't have

57
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,839
you know what is the right time timing
gauge mister time is precious if you

58
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,290
just

59
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,029
flew out somewhere trip somewhere
whatever

60
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:19,699
you don't have the backup plan

61
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,339
jurisprudence customers are ticked off

62
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:25,189
um... at you know people sometimes you
know call you out

63
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:29,040
stilts so you know might be late at
night uh... you know people are like or

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,549
your after whatever you can do and so
you know you

65
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,900
on their system that they gave you
permission

66
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,869
not like hey you should go check so any
haha

67
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,039
uh...

68
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,819
effective

69
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:43,050
but you know you could possibly didn't
wrote that

70
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,249
almond because you can't

71
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:48,539
that's that's why i put the stuff
together socio as a kid that's i think

72
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,339
that's how most of these things

73
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:51,959
and upcoming out psycho

74
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,509
whatever i can do it so

75
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:55,499
um...

76
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:58,069
so it's not your computer's this is a

77
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,699
fear that's

78
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:09,699
framing someone yes even frame someone
with this

79
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:17,499
and and the backup

80
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:21,459
backed up by i want to know the concepts
that i got second went through it so you

81
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:21,819
know

82
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,709
from caramel also

83
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,269
uh... alright uh...

84
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:28,309
recognition is

85
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,719
all right so this is an unfamiliar
system nombre base we have a lot of

86
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,599
stuff that you might see you here in
maps can't come from there before you

87
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,430
start really doubling in the stuff

88
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,360
will just assume for the context of of
this presentation

89
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,510
it's mostly on from that i mean probably
when you walked up to assist them see

90
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,440
that you can see it's gonna run windows
that's running or sex

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,159
it's a server and mature running unix
variance

92
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,419
but you know you're coming in just at
that briefing

93
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,349
knowledge about this not a lot of prep

94
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,760
uh... the access to these systems

95
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,669
it's not for the purpose of stealing
them to sell them

96
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:00,699
on e-bay

97
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,129
or craigslist org that's not our goal
here

98
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:07,400
it's to utilize them or gather
information from them so we're getting

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,390
asses access to these systems

100
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,849
we're with that's not our attention
steve

101
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:14,129
hopefully

102
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,990
theory possibly

103
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,769
you would not be you would not have
administrative privileges through the

104
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,069
system

105
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:21,999
theory

106
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:25,939
um... and that's kind of will be working
today these are systems that

107
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:29,809
united you're not going after
specifically the sysadmin

108
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:32,119
box somewhere

109
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:37,369
reviews and other stuff uh... enough
public or private

110
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:39,739
so that's kind of our pretext to uh...

111
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,259
we're talking about

112
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,029
public computers

113
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:46,559
um... restrictions a physical
restriction there's not much because the

114
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:51,369
public this post be used by you the
general public or a subset you know

115
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,479
maybe you're a member of somewhere

116
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,469
or uh... your you know

117
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:58,349
summer for a while this like

118
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:01,980
then you're given public access to this
very of the restrictions virtual

119
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,009
again hopefully you're not the system is
trader on the system

120
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,830
that never happens uh... so they'll play
that they've walked the dog with a more

121
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,839
dance

122
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,769
you would assume that's what was the
case

123
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,509
the death of the desktop is made out a
little more

124
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,719
difficult

125
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,259
computers you know out out in the world

126
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,369
uh... how many people

127
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:27,519
have flash use their desktop

128
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,699
and we're in the like this is this is
the academy of the crowd that would be

129
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,659
doing

130
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,039
not many people

131
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:35,509
everybody's got laptops now

132
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:39,009
everybody a lot of other people that
just use their smart like they don't own

133
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:39,979
a computer

134
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,530
or you have tablets i mean these

135
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,129
people don't even have like reconsider

136
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:46,249
refer to a computer laptop

137
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:49,619
top whatever they just using their
mobile phones slash larger version of

138
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:53,529
the mobile phone as their system that
got around to everybody's got a very

139
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:54,710
cheap now

140
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,089
so you know whereas ten years ago again
there but had desktops laptop so

141
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,100
expensive or

142
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,180
there are still working alltop hardware

143
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,139
rebut is mobile devices now so

144
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,849
places that normally provide stopped
it's it's rare her to see them

145
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:12,580
however you distill around

146
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,069
uh... libraries you know a lot of us all
public libraries have

147
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,870
uh... public computers again that's is
the membership thing on the at this time

148
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,289
sometimes it's a sign up sometimes you
know

149
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,450
to use the systems on college campuses
it's the same sex and as a library

150
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,800
they try to provide a public computers
and sometimes you need a listed

151
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,199
credentials

152
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,809
uh... cyber cafes

153
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,690
found when he removed here recently

154
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,870
uh... i googled it and apparently
there's one at least one and relatives

155
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,039
anybody actually ever been to one

156
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,769
in this area

157
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:50,059
they close down i'm pretty sure that's
that

158
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,979
what's the one year

159
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,409
yeah i mean that's not what his their
target demographic now

160
00:06:55,409 --> 00:07:00,129
uh... three at the library and everybody
else have so it's not after

161
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,149
common now

162
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,629
uh... hotels have them

163
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,339
uh... computer stores

164
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,830
uh... surgeon beautifull stores that
might be across the street from this

165
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,739
location

166
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:14,279
they love to have people come in and
just check their email login face book

167
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,059
do anything they want and they know
there's no restrictions

168
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:19,659
on their use

169
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,310
yet and um... i

170
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,460
camera shots and this was segue into i
haven't done much research in this trial

171
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,099
but

172
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,110
uh... you know like if if you're using a
kiosk

173
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,520
it's a public you know it peter that
you'd team

174
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,610
might not know me think of it as that

175
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,470
but it is the back in the a stepped-up
printers as other things like that

176
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,089
that our own kind of different

177
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,319
functions you don't have a

178
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,430
keyboard and mouse you not you know it's
very

179
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,280
restricted

180
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,690
functionality

181
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,169
unit was still it's probably running
windows xp in the back end

182
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,809
and you have some sort of interface and
a lot of these

183
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:56,169
um camera shops you've got you know your
media readers you've got a usb one

184
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:00,189
um... you some of them do have keyboards
and mice and stuff like that so

185
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,699
thing about food chaos there's a lot of
computers out there

186
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,759
that you can access it was all the ones
that you know like them

187
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,139
like the minuet burger king's probably
run xp and back they don't have access

188
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,499
to it it's there but

189
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,899
you've got to be an interesting like
assessment

190
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,029
trying to mess with that

191
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,519
but that's our talk about today

192
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,800
uh... public computers

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,419
yeah so here's some that have come
across

194
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,250
recently

195
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,499
snapped a shot of

196
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:29,309
don't just use things that's not what
i'm suggesting is these are just

197
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,220
examples if you had permission

198
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,970
yeah

199
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,270
um...

200
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,310
private computers

201
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,190
we're talkin' personal computers
business systems here

202
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,110
disastrous

203
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,390
access obviously uh... more restrictive

204
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,910
you probably have the meal in the
building uh...

205
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,089
behind locked doors possibly

206
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:53,189
somebody's watching out for them using
them whatever

207
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:55,990
of virtual access they they do

208
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,290
being discussed in the last document you

209
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,310
you'd start out with good intentions
that we're gonna lock this down all you

210
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,950
need uh... pickup symantec throughout
well you know a lot of thought now

211
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,890
that's run get him a here but

212
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,210
well you know when irene start under so

213
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,790
you would assume maybe research at some
but not necessarily had a very you know

214
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,069
you could only run this application cut
level

215
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:19,350
if there is a lot

216
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,310
where do you find these offices

217
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,710
campus i mean if if

218
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,990
these are still in computers it for you
know

219
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,730
that's the kind of thing you might have
in scope

220
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,790
normally but you know

221
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,979
to stuff to think about

222
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:33,660
people's homes multiple work from home

223
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,010
you can find that in scope princess in
summer

224
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,189
uh... people bring their their laptops
so cafe

225
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:41,010
they get it back in for a while

226
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,350
you you can mail you got a five minute
window

227
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,900
libraries

228
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,020
stinks and study

229
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,330
given to the study uh... cons

230
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,790
lead laptops liner

231
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,700
or connected so i thought here

232
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,480
um... private computers

233
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,940
so if this one in the middle of grabbed
off baxter website that's what they're

234
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,769
running with that's that's there that's
the river systems there

235
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,260
you can see uh...

236
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,440
it's over the the boat anchor uh... xx

237
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,170
yes

238
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,100
so these injustices that just took this
like ten minutes ago

239
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,210
that picture of me at the restaurant

240
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,780
no i didn't really think picture side
and you know bayliner but

241
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,620
how do you see that's kind of stuff yeah
fairly often i mean

242
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,760
some people are pretty cautious but you
never know exhibits the plan

243
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,509
okay sullivan on those of the computer
side that's kind of art

244
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:28,670
targets uh... systems there

245
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,950
so per ton

246
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,220
i guess i'd bet put this together
certain

247
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,060
let them talk a lot easier

248
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,510
what is it

249
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,010
so it's sad

250
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,910
platform

251
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,960
it's probably the best workforce it's
basically a a

252
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,920
consolidation of a lot of pools that
other people

253
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,670
who are really smart together and i just
bought

254
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,519
essentially

255
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,040
usu parts that one of us the cut on a
home

256
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,220
talk a lot of which is a bunch of poor
location of the running windows live

257
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,740
and the other one islam

258
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,420
live distributions you know

259
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,100
like doctor will cover before this

260
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,230
but that's kind of issue major
compartments

261
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,280
part of the focus of this uh... project
was uh...

262
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,320
create an environment that was

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,390
configurable

264
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,350
so if you don't want the forensics you
know you can figure to do a lot of

265
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,139
forensic stuff and maybe for the other
stuff by the wayside

266
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,929
org opposite or you know

267
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,019
if you're getting into the security of
this is good because you've got it all

268
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,210
comes sitting there

269
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,579
and you can mess tinker with different
things so you can add the broad skip it

270
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:27,970
uh... update it

271
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,680
installer uh... basically wanted
something that i did have to karen cases

272
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,790
cds

273
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,699
uh... we all have this case the cds

274
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:38,269
probably filled from papa drives you
know are a floppy disks that mean that

275
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:39,630
we use for stuff

276
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,830
used

277
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,390
they were still use floppy disks for
things

278
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,320
and a semi regular basis

279
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,910
there's hands and heads up the apt

280
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,600
surrounds him i know not know when papa
decisions

281
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,930
it's it's just it's about that yet

282
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,810
basically half

283
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,680
that there are no i i i have to have
some tenants um...

284
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,560
obvious yeah lets them

285
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,510
that's one area

286
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,800
uh... so he had this but also adopted
one by max allot of his life systems you

287
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,120
know you find it states that there are
some but is it

288
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,440
if they're running live

289
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,250
you can't really modifies so

290
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,740
that's a little still gotta arm to make
it easier

291
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,630
runs off usb flash

292
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,280
so that was you know so you can keep on
you all the time sort of the big

293
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,740
parking like we had something i i was at
bridging attack them

294
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,870
the student there that worked an
accident of this

295
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,540
we had the tomb of software

296
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,670
you know it's not like

297
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,870
five hundred

298
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,700
cv

299
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,560
binder that's like this big

300
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,300
you have every viewer best ever posits
warning for certain disturbance at that

301
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,419
point you burn

302
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,779
every new version that will maybe i'll
need

303
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,120
santos four

304
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,340
at some point so i'll keep it in

305
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,610
um... so yeah thats to avoid that we
consolidate one medium though crazy

306
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,310
partitioning stuff i'm a big fan of
trying to keep you know as much pieces

307
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,280
that you can so anybody's ever dual
booted norm the partition of stuff that

308
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,030
was the bigflix projects like these

309
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,140
but for the background on the total
weird working today

310
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,660
i suggest to make it

311
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,130
just enough for starters

312
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,230
uh... it's it's about five big on
unpacked if you're gonna be doing stuff

313
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,370
my final downloading files or whatever
it takes

314
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,010
for a bottom line is they're like

315
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,780
fifteen dollars that cost nothing

316
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,110
uh... you get a flash drive or in this
sort of working with more recently which

317
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,320
for the court the microsd e-card

318
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,839
getting usb reader

319
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,950
and the nasty plus a usb

320
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,239
reader i'm gonna go why that's really
cool

321
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,640
later on in the talk

322
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,780
i'd like to have a data drive as well
for these kind of systems

323
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,560
uh... its schedule but be able to
segregate

324
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,200
a day dr

325
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,560
hi so you know

326
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,700
it's

327
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,310
that such a thing like that

328
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,410
don't wanna

329
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,030
but you got the yell journey so i feel
you know that's that's more thing

330
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,760
uh... if you can't read

331
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,640
i found that the other day i've had this
thing since i was like

332
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,580
fourteen years old i don't know where i
got it like what i was like

333
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,800
i was also like idea

334
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,770
that'll make your does that

335
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,830
give a date dr

336
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,900
job only

337
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,400
anyway different a data drive so you can
put all your stuff that it

338
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,930
all the things you're finding

339
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,000
whatever external stuff to put it on
there

340
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,499
there's a there's a um... folder
uncluttered structure

341
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,780
documents folder

342
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,419
but if you're working assessment
sometimes nice too

343
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,720
you know you've got environment here

344
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,720
put their stuff over something so flush
out for the harddrive whatever

345
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,340
so this is the setup that i've been
working with now

346
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,850
it that looks like a lot of imparts they
lost all in together

347
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,260
you've got a hum

348
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,730
was the laser pointer

349
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,090
move it was born

350
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,800
wilson

351
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,980
picked up in port

352
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,680
you know there's a border

353
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,130
is still a cinematic icon

354
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,730
ok we'll just move on

355
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,790
opportu en

356
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,180
hi just wanted to pretend laser pointer

357
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,330
i know i'm not good

358
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:26,790
saba giving it away as a prize later on

359
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,410
so

360
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,860
forget dead the prizes for who can run
the fastest

361
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,080
slick felix

362
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,320
rechargeable batteries very

363
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,370
reassembled that every time

364
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,430
so

365
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,330
thank you very much

366
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,900
so

367
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,180
uh... gets a mic arrest the card

368
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,830
this is a little reader

369
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,370
for that my christy it's it's it's
plugin up here and it's part of that was

370
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,830
a matter of life but it's

371
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,040
you know you can see that's just a
standard size flashdrive

372
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,700
and it's it's very very small it's it's
convenient except for its so small that

373
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,820
i have things that i have to put it on
to something is it

374
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,720
it's really a bike the size of a
thumbnail so it's it's very easy to lose

375
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,340
i've lost it yet

376
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,600
um... this is that's the car this is a
reader you can i see this slide

377
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,290
uh... together

378
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,910
pre so hard you know

379
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,260
talking about that a lot more later on

380
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,990
uh... live

381
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,860
this is the uh... lobby would here are
very damp from people aren't so there's

382
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,980
a lot of step-by-step stuff

383
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,850
just how things go

384
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,770
booting from usb at eleven forty organ
flush out but the system off

385
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,030
on selecting a bit mean you know it's a
function keen dropdown

386
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,420
uh... mother what you can modify do

387
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,130
yet there's just a little

388
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,530
my but the pilots on my laptop

389
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,000
selecting anyone act based remote most
systems don't have usb storage first by

390
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,680
default in the bias

391
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,619
very rare mostly it's like cd

392
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,810
hardest

393
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,129
probably usb

394
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:05,800
that you know

395
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,349
some of them stop publica diskette

396
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,230
incase you ever look at out there

397
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,419
um... there's gotta kinda very specific
especially without the age of the system

398
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,560
this could be first and second non there
at all

399
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,380
um...

400
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,070
maybe onboard but you need a modified
that's that

401
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:26,030
the usb is above whatever else might be
burning from most the time the hardest

402
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,870
um... so there's

403
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,530
initially reading from it

404
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,590
somebody sets the bus passes run from
the security side

405
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,510
it's pretty good thing about it's not
like

406
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,410
and all day all but in you know it's one
of those checkboxes proudly

407
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,200
yet know what i've come across it

408
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,310
why don't we haven't really actually
that's a good point how many people have

409
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,640
done it on their system or four

410
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,440
work clients whatever

411
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,620
that's a fair number here that's i mean
that's really good 'cause what is it

412
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,970
her other than

413
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,590
visiting the document is

414
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:03,590
you kind of visits

415
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,140
there there's no there's no seema
there's a battery like internal uh...

416
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,750
okay

417
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,780
that's exactly what ya'll talk right
here so but yeah i say that i was saying

418
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,559
that the

419
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,170
shipley computers uh...

420
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,710
of maybe is that all models some of them
like it

421
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,650
the uh... the bios requires power to
store stuff so

422
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,040
but there's no tobacco battery which is
what most motherboards have

423
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,299
poll the battery outward rains
completely

424
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,550
it reset city defaults

425
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,900
so that's actually

426
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,169
we're talking around so yep by its past
that you can set it to you

427
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,370
accessed the bios you can also sometimes
of it

428
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,410
to boot

429
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,050
so yes i've been here that's what i used
to have

430
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,460
you brute bound for your desk uh...
disturb you you have to do that and then

431
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,239
you can

432
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,110
possibly access device

433
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,310
had

434
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,050
we're just focus on building so v can if
you can get to it from uh... the boot

435
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,210
menu you know we don't bother tennis

436
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,440
as a that mentioned uh... bri setting
them

437
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,170
uh... well-placed this is the three set
the bios

438
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,590
and out desktop impossibility up if you
have a lot of time

439
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,660
gilligan screen case

440
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,950
you can remove the battery for a while

441
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,140
uh... what's a certain powered of
default off there's normally a reset

442
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,320
on the motherboard

443
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,499
jump around there

444
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:24,070
rebuilt animal reset the settings

445
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,920
yet yet

446
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,940
that don't really like that woody
diatoms up on just opening up an axis in

447
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,390
the hard drive in stop its cool guys

448
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,030
or are you know i'm actually support

449
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,770
social in a hello

450
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,270
not dala ko i wasn't over from the other
branch whatever

451
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,340
that's another that's another top not

452
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,230
unit go too much and social movement
will just put like a

453
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,630
you social engineered-in did this

454
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,880
um... so yeah there's actually there's a
that the back door

455
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,790
uh... bios passwords which you know some
geniuses like

456
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,660
okay yet does all of them have uh... the
back door ones and it's basically i'm

457
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,140
sure the fop russell's

458
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,080
when is it it set locked themselves out
they're gonna called eye to support and

459
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,419
i got to have to you know tell them to

460
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,179
open up the case and find the jumpers
step on the pins for everything that

461
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,240
that's gonna happen

462
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,940
so like i would i would just a back door
and than it was so

463
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,650
use this word instead

464
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,750
and uh... so that was a really good plan

465
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,740
and a lot of them available i think it's
mostly for older and

466
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,650
motherboards because people kind of
figure it out up

467
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,940
uh... and there's also password crackers
for biases some of the mill execute

468
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,410
balls some of the more live

469
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,169
cds because a lot of times the default
is set

470
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:41,679
the of the boot lives cds first so you
got to do a lot of stuff for months

471
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,230
another really cool thing

472
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,780
as arab is this out

473
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,230
flock print manager

474
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,550
and of show a little bit of it later on

475
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,160
it's a live cd

476
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,080
that axes of movement

477
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,769
so it'll allow you to be from usb

478
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:58,869
it's it's it's like you know to tell you
about it it sounds like who cares but to

479
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:00,419
me it's really exciting

480
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,970
good now i don't have to screw it all
the buyer stuff cuz

481
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,049
almost always

482
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:07,450
always you can do it from and let
somebody really did a good job said

483
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,950
uh... this is the public computer

484
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,740
maybe i should never have to be from

485
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,300
cd unless i know the bios password i'll
change it so it's hard disk first

486
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,560
is raising a coupla practice but the you
know that's a pretty good setting

487
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,980
that's a good setting to have the public
computer

488
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,419
but how many people do that that's you
know

489
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:25,669
i thought the map to come out ads

490
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:28,220
or maybe assets in access restrictions
but

491
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,700
the bios as you know pretty low on the
list of things in the time

492
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,290
uh... tidbits that from uh... from the
cd drive

493
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,880
puppet master is really cool

494
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,440
alternative to on us without stuffing

495
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,800
almost guaranteed to work

496
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,599
since the last of this is all the
default tools i have in there

497
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,110
uh... what i tried to do with this
project is a have allotted

498
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,120
variety

499
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
but not a lot of overlap

500
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,690
so there are a lot of really great tool
dot there that i use and fully support

501
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,880
and they're awesome but i didn't put the
money but if all because it's already

502
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,500
like four gig in size

503
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,330
people like using fat thirty two

504
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,800
as a file system especially on fox jives

505
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,630
so you know going over everything about
it now

506
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,830
that thirty-two max of four gay

507
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,260
what i got over that size for the
download just the forms disconnects

508
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,950
flowed i can download this bolivar so

509
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,830
i'm trying to stick on a four but
everything is getting so big like that

510
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,020
to happen doubled in size that's not

511
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,710
which has often could you get a lot more
tools that there is just

512
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:36,640
more difficult for me to some charm
shuffle software so yeah that some

513
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,470
uh... that's what was on there i'll show
you a little more second home

514
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:48,470
yeah

515
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:56,640
uh...

516
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,640
faint

517
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:11,620
sedu recalls drink anymore like adjuster
support

518
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:15,660
and we'll talk list

519
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,230
wow that is really hard and i apologize

520
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,740
aloha gender that's really hard to see

521
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,880
what it's just tiny anybody

522
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,310
routine frightening thomas cannon

523
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,169
uh... so this is a popular magic

524
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:33,750
it's a real shame because it's got this
really cool background

525
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,740
stood it's falling three stars

526
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,580
relook at its fine besides i can barely
see it here there's little white

527
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,170
lights and stuff so it's

528
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,300
purposely gata and its tiny it's like
less than a bag all this its

529
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,480
i wasn't very fast

530
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,760
eyes of the camera special offer from

531
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,370
uh...

532
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,409
i'll need to be called out again

533
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:01,800
anyway so that's not terribly important
you can do it

534
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,890
you can

535
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,260
this witness haunted now

536
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,950
na

537
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,890
okay well that's slightly better uh...
it's a

538
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,670
it looks better and i can anybody but
the very front row kind of see that

539
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:22,010
there's like little star struck a well
so you can't trust them insults me

540
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:27,450
uh... anyway what it

541
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,900
also like tough back towards the slam
shot

542
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,710
and you know

543
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,270
goes offline everywhere we're doomed

544
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,740
africa

545
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,210
okay so this is this is the flopped but
manager

546
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,149
uh... but menu

547
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:42,509
uh... it's a really cool detects what's
on the current system so like it has

548
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:43,830
multiple hard drives

549
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,420
it auto detects everything

550
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,940
and it's got the drivers for the usb

551
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,909
yet so it's able to

552
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:56,909
detectors for you just you know selected

553
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,250
so that the question was about uh... the
bios requests like i've talked about

554
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,250
earlier with to the issues that by
passing the buck so there's there's the

555
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,120
two things up

556
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,380
what you can set

557
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,419
any sort of like that first thing that
happens when it gets power

558
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,890
is it blocks everything's as i am five
unloaded the bios

559
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,619
first thing i do say the passwords you
can't do anything with this

560
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:36,920
system that's unlike the motherboard is

561
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,760
nothing and so you reset it

562
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,370
so in that case you've just because you
can't do anything which is a very

563
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,740
uncommon especially in a in a and uh...

564
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,559
everytime east of some user unplugged it
they have to call tech support and get a

565
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,190
bias so that's like

566
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,820
not going to happen in this country may
be at home

567
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,390
vehicle but discuss maritza

568
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,280
but out there and then there's the one
to access the fire

569
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,999
so it's just if you want a modified
stuff from the bios

570
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,610
you have to type and password

571
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,280
uh... so in that case this is fine is is
that as long as they have them

572
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,580
the cd dvd whatever brooding first

573
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,750
you'll get into this

574
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,419
so the first thing a slice of the hard
drive that gives you a the floppy drive

575
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:17,100
c_d_-rom in usd

576
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,430
so working

577
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,090
x okay

578
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,720
the prod bme where it's been a little
flaky with

579
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,860
usb stuff that i've been having a
robotic

580
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,809
trouble with its uh... leather

581
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:30,460
conc

582
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,230
all right so this is the do menu

583
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,070
people have messed this up before

584
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,940
outburst very brief talked with the
spektr bloodworth nitpick

585
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,029
you know ritz we've

586
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:44,429
and testing stuff a lot of people their
new like that's you know

587
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,270
something really good if you're going to
do

588
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,529
try to do offenses

589
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:51,259
testing and stuff but that's great uh...
altered that cd is just great for

590
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,340
anybody who's ever touched computer

591
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,299
it has all those floppy images that the
other companies would send out

592
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,989
they they'd consolidated them and yes
you can

593
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:02,250
boot them from the u

594
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,620
we'll just call them to do

595
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,419
uh... but they probably is really useful
tools today theirs

596
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,090
you know it's dozens of really cool
tools like test your hardware

597
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,520
so what is aren't necessarily security
stuff that you can use a lot of it

598
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,530
on this is a really cool tool and
therefore resetting

599
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,960
the passwords in windows system so

600
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,210
that's like

601
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,270
that makes it worth it altogether uh...

602
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,380
and that sucker

603
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,279
that's enough

604
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:29,250
it's really great stuff if you're doing
any sort of admin you need to have all c

605
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,059
l two bc

606
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,360
well they seaver windows

607
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,680
islam

608
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,519
at this field ended when his environment
com p_e_ when his p

609
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:39,490
it's the thing that loads windows

610
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,370
yes uh... you know what you have to
start addition to this account of my

611
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,230
default licensing stuff but they do

612
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,400
basically gives you a portable windows
environment with a bunch of awesome

613
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,890
stuff

614
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,470
preinstalled on it

615
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,490
uh... trinity is a lot of cool

616
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,530
some lemme it's the same vein is open
city

617
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,310
of crack fans out here

618
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:03,090
it's good password cracking it's not you
know as quick as but the talk yesterday

619
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,610
but it straight with tom if you have an
under fourteen character weird and

620
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:12,510
windows

621
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,210
over that's a good question company is
asking how much more space ultimate city

622
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,300
for windows takes

623
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,649
i actually have no idea i cannot
remember

624
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:23,769
it's not a lot

625
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:27,850
because it's on the cd like it's on the
witness either xp cd

626
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,310
along with all your install file so it's

627
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,950
very limited but it's not very

628
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,350
but they do and saw a lot of additional

629
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,900
software with its roots

630
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,720
i would say less than a gig but i i i

631
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,350
not positive

632
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,830
yeah hey can you find yet that a kid you
can get all this installed

633
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,000
uh... until it you can do network
backups puppy academic is of a

634
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,580
minimalist expressions of thanks uh...
well researched environments that's good

635
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,540
news is pretty self explanatory uh...

636

638
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,110
speaking of dare

what do you do it all but i've got it
set you get your own

642
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,260
he backed up

643
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,040
uh... so hard

644
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,440
program somewhere

645
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,869
our backup your files

646
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,790
uh... so i'll convert is justice really
putting that

647
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:30,540
kind of circumvent last-modified windows
to allow you to do

648
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,130
that some i'm not going to blind

649
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,270
from tima purposes

650
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,890
its fifth gamer seems really slow
through usb

651
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,730
funneling many people are trying to boot

652
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,640
usb

653
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,370
this is like nobody ever does this its

654
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,930
that are really there's not a big outcry

655
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:58,930
sir opt for

656
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,390
stats are awesome

657
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,830
and social divide them into the never
work with them before you know you there

658
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,340
live that you can you can modify them
while they're running

659
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,520
him out by them

660
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,130
and updates and stuff

661
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,669
you know just of their lives

662
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:32,940
alive for a reason so it's good to have
scripts there to configure back

663
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,630
uh... time lost his book

664
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,470
so in this e there's a kind of set up

665
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,889
you were might be accessing say if
you're on then assessment

666
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:43,120
and you'd you'd try to get some these
computers

667
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,860
your at somebody's office they're out to
lunch you're not you know

668
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,100
your session isn't going to last for
three days of unrestricted access you

669
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,430
got now

670
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,790
to get your stuff done

671
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,540
so having a uh...

672
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,230
script that configures environment yet
does everything automates

673
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,600
through the tax that you want

674
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,860
you know uh... do

675
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,170
is great so you could throw it on the
foxtrot before you start up you can save

676
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,520
the file shot by doing stuff its

677
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,780
it's the way to go i provide violence

678
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,070
uh... be different forms yeah

679
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,640
so i know a few unit sometimes it's just
easier to write a script to do something

680
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,170
and save it cus wants to remember
everything we have to remember heavy

681
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,269
repository scripts

682
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:21,890
it's very helpful it just

683
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,630
some support sample setting up a lot

684
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,050
um... for the configuration

685
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,610
maybe write a script you automatically
download

686
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,159
all the host systems

687
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,480
uh... microsoft

688
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,309
stop documents and the password to
something not gonna get that much but

689
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:39,960
it's great to direct your steps in this
live garments

690
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,000
uh... mark we learned that it's not ok

691
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,620
um... a lot of stuff in there

692
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,840
uh... to run off of the drop of the

693
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,140
when this trial

694
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,820
usb drive in windows

695
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,909
uh... you shoe do you

696
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:54,400
dot install resources on system

697
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,370
so it's great could you not bike you
know and stalin whatever i got the box

698
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,780
all right now that we put this package
on their you wait for install yet the

699
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,810
down there that this is just one slide

700
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,500
not to be aware very quickly but in
persistent iran's much

701
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,370
configure ball update a bull

702
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,400
talked about that

703
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,340
so run the demo two

704
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:23,340
let's switch over to

705
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,920
go into windows seven

706
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:46,920
word

707
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,640
it's it's just very picky about passing
to use itself

708
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,960
who the others

709
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,760
so here

710
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,430
saliva demo game winner

711
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,420
understand

712
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:14,420
hide no phones about that

713
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,970
excellent the resolutions to be well c
experts

714
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,479
public user so this is a

715
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,810
public user

716
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:28,810
uh...

717
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,360
yes

718
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
and it

719
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,640
it's still not okay cool

720
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,080
so but we open up that time

721
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,010
called

722
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,679
that murdered quickly 'cause

723
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,070
text so here's the delga com

724
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,230
tried to break everything down and sulit
areas selective office

725
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,380
uh...

726
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,710
networking

727
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,549
forensics and this is a man you know
they've so if you install your own tools

728
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:02,390
you'll have to stop that use the deep in
thought other poor but gation it won't

729
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,409
be named the same way but see finding
stuff

730
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:06,749
you just have to get used to

731
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:08,399
what labeled

732
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,169
but there's all kinds of stuff here and
were

733
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:17,789
this i was gonna show firefox but
through usb on this it just takes work

734
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,509
picked up a random one

735
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:21,400
this is that a little tool for a home

736
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,849
buddy cookies

737
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:23,940
which in this

738
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,649
scenarios fraud but he had this uh...
just the cookies running and i

739
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,040
um what else we have a there's a lot of

741
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,499
talked the chilled

742
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:37,899
uh... four for and that's the lot stuff

743
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:40,969
uh... there's a lot of analytics uh...
on that you know there's also a virus

744
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:44,019
scanners that you can use

745
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:45,609
backdoor stuff

746
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:48,959
uh... networking one of the you know
ne'matt

747
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:55,139
um... guy but i guess that's like pigeon
give up

748
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,189
for mechanical stuff

749
00:34:57,189 --> 00:34:59,449
uh... firefox is on here

750
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:01,489
uh... portable

751
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:05,050
open office so i don't think it is and
what do you trust them system well

752
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,950
notwithstanding

753
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,920
you don't just much you can bring it
here

754
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,539
you net tax

755
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:11,139
shes always fun

756
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:13,109
uh... live show

757
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:17,169
uh... you've cane you have met us fully
which took a little while performing got

758
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:18,289
on there

759
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,960
uh...

760
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,950
uh...

761
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,649
uh... visa point

762
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:25,629
why export connection

763
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:27,280
yeah ok see evidence for it

764
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,059
uh... a stealth candidacy of a lot of

765
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:33,339
examining registry that winners
registries amazing 'cause it's towards

766
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,799
everything you're really ever need c

767
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:36,530
order anything

768
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,939
so there's a lot of tools that like
examine the registry recover

769
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,769
all your path of everything you thought
the cool passive in desert storm the

770
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:44,369
registry and it's like

771
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:45,610
in plain text so

772
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,070
you know you'll end up pretty quickly
starting this recovery area says

773
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,280
i want your

774
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,069
a remote desktop key uh... our uh...
password i want your email password year

775
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,189
instant all wasn't

776
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,880
all stuff in their you could

777
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,480
some not going over exactly how to go
through it sacrilegious very broad-scale

778
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,359
what's in there

779
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:06,890
on the lot of an alleged on the current
systems

780
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,240
and other utilities uh...

781
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,200
who's a cygwin

782
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,639
down here

783
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:16,490
okay so if you're if u if your windows
person unite graph you know it's a scary

784
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,690
where you can install cygwin which is
simple

785
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,079
and it runs

786
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,999
lyrics unix c in your

787
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:24,959
on your on

788
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:27,220
window system so it's a lot of fun

789
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,639
this is

790
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,039
probably the most powerful thing but

791
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,449
you have to configure is abrasive made
basically brings

792
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:35,640
a lot of your

793
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,970
polemics people tools over to this is
something and when the people are going

794
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,740
to get you a serious about using this

795
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,579
i recommend

796
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,629
you mess with the um...

797
00:36:43,629 --> 00:36:44,509
cygwin

798
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:48,720
and install audio stuff on their cousin
you have a portable environment

799
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,390
that runs a lot of the stuff that's
running in nyc backtrack you can get out

800
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,849
of the must the party but a lot of
things like that

801
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,900
like meh display runs on cygwin here

802
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,380
the several tools that run consequence
so uh... that's a really cool thing to

803
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,209
get into i don't have a key passive so
you always have to use it for this sort

804
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:05,429
of thing you can

805
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:07,159
persons

806
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,880
so anyway that some

807
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,410
experts will get uh...

808
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,109
real quick people

809
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:15,779
questions that into hell

810
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:22,779
sothat i decided to show

811
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:32,979
uh...

812
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:35,309
that's good

813
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:38,939
so in this room is environment were
working and uh...

814
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:45,939
it's uh...

815
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:16,119
so in those environments uh...

816
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,219
uh...

817
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:20,279
uh... those environments are the gaelic
restrictions like doubt not beyond the

818
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:21,150
install

819
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,290
the reason the portable as great as a
lot and at least the basic she should be

820
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,249
is not allow people to install

821
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:29,930
on your systems i mean that's that like
the first thing we check out the don't

822
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,630
let anybody install

823
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,429
well this gets around because the
insulation most of the two things

824
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,149
the windows

825
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:39,680
execute a board that is used for
insulation every strips that

826
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
co crap it himself

827
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,950
well if you don't need to install stuff
and use that

828
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,260
might be might be good

829
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,150
to run stuff off of the foster so that's
why

830
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,659
and i think the circumvent a lot of
stuff

831
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:53,119
and uh...

832
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,929
and other things like that access to
fund to certain next year books and you

833
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:58,480
can say you know you're only

834
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,850
you you can access this other stuff on
their i'll but you can run these

835
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,149
portable ones because of the rules for
random i'm

836
00:39:06,149 --> 00:39:08,240
so to put i don't know

837
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,969
time one

838
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:14,639
okay quicker

839
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,420
elected leader

840
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,769
certain ways to get a good in an
explorer to get to that

841
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:22,089
and explore

842
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:23,179
as you can uh...

843
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:24,319
type in the past

844
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:27,420
this isn't like you type in d coleman
everett

845
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,540
but for

846
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,500
and now you can access so again we're
looking from a pop-up public computer

847
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,619
that probably has some sort sections

848
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,839
command-line didn't get up to the
command line

849
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:37,970
uh... actually the second

850
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,459
we'll talk about the second how to do
that

851
00:39:40,459 --> 00:39:42,119
the giant planet

852
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,879
life is good

853
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:45,270
when his keys are awesome

854
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,159
uh... sola fans will restrict your
environment

855
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,159
so you know there's no linked to a lot
of things

856
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,709
so in the next uh... i think they're
nights now

857
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:54,660
do things with it

858
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,289
and what does he have to have links to
soften you know if you have to get and

859
00:39:58,289 --> 00:39:59,149
nine

860
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:00,130
stupid but

861
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,079
so here is that the witness keys to run
things come to get explore

862
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,319
uh... searching in the good ones to get
access to

863
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,209
the underlying system for the purpose in
this case

864
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:12,299
of running the toolkit

865
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,280
microsoft help and so helpful

866
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,239
that lets you run the command prompt

867
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,019
from microsoft helped

868
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:20,859
that's just that's

869
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:21,880
would you like this

870
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,029
so i mean if you don't open mic
self-help type in command prompt

871
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:29,259
it brings you to an article in there
about the command prompt that's one of

872
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:29,980
them said

873
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,400
opening command prompt thing

874
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,249
this is how you can command prompt but
would you like us to do it for you to

875
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:36,799
say

876
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:40,290
you've got the command prompt so that's
that's a very very

877
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,109
that's part of the most helpful thing in
microsoft help i've ever seen

878
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,789
defeating maybe i'm not going to go into
this

879
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:49,359
too much

880
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,729
i found that

881
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:53,019
when you open the toolkit menu

882
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:56,639
it access is all of the binary files to
read their image

883
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,059
so in that case of your eighty isn't set
to automatically scanned only look at

884
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:02,239
you know when you're looking things

885
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,789
loads actresses all of that stuff

886
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:09,120
so avoiding going to interface you can
step is going to poor blacks directory

887
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,370
and shivers through there to get what
you want everything is label pretty well

888
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,369
you can find stuff you're looking for

889
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,730
what could be hell

890
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,260
for more information on

891
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,079
what's in there

892
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,160
but not doing it that way can be one way
to get through the a_p_

893
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,550
incurably

894
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,680
you know mister perot

895
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,479
blossom that there's lots of other stuff
out there

896
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:29,499
they own a focus on his right blocking
time

897
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:33,899
so still running from potshots but being
able to write block which is pretty

898
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:36,769
awesome

899
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:39,279
so why would we want to write bucket

900
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:39,980
kills it

901
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,179
the ever does the stops the antivirus
from you know

902
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:45,150
deleted all my awesome tools

903
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,710
and stops by arsonists

904
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,890
from installing

905
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,809
on the onset of turning me into tools
and essentially

906
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:51,809
um

907
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:56,039
so you know we're like how this is great
you know it's on one of you what i want

908
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:56,309
that

909
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:57,800
aboard in every machine

910
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,240
and the network well one of them

911
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,170
almost guaranteed to be out so then you
become the person using up spreading

912
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,220
that around kids

913
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,619
occasion don't know there's been a
couple of things with nickel apartments

914
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,319
that went over usb

915
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,670
uh... couple of of malicious thing so
you know when to be that guy irreligious

916
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,169
and it would be like that

917
00:42:14,169 --> 00:42:17,380
uh... and so you know coming environment
usb at figure out

918
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,840
how not to be that guy

919
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,349
this is how this is that that's what i
should type of this

920
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:23,169
how not to be back at

921
00:42:23,169 --> 00:42:26,359
uh... usb right barker's you can
purchased them

922
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:30,249
for forensics purposes there's a lot of
cats out there for forensic stuff

923
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:31,579
that's like you know

924
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:33,910
government-sanctioned one

925
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,359
the lawyers to be happy with them 'cause
you paid a lot of money which means that

926
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,369
work

927
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:39,940
uh... they're expensive

928
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,639
hundreds of dollars

929
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,509
for the friends of the huge

930
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:47,039
you know they've got i'd imagine if you
open it up it's like

931
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,130
aligned on from here to there was some
sometime in the middle of it is the big

932
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,039
block

933
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,819
but a lot of them they have all the
stuff like tell you the data transfer

934
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:55,429
rates just push a button

935
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:57,740
the fancy in that school in a few

936
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,049
if that's your thing great but they are

937
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:04,069
for first bus mortals it's it's very
expensive

938
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:07,809
you can't read and i so with donna so
it's going to run your stuff man

939
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:09,130
you can you know camp

940
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,119
prerequisite to rewrite avoided an
honest with yourself

941
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,099
it's not

942
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,409
disintegrates i would say that's like
alpha

943
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:19,339
it's there exist i really a mass of the
too much but

944
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:24,029
if you want us there and tell me how it
goes that the great

945
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:26,170
so that actually that warning that
should help with

946
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,719
previous ones a lot of stuff

947
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,199
is broken when you went from he says
because it's designed to modify that's

948
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,009
awesome

949
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,189
but that's the card stuff is

950
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:38,579
so instead of spending three hundred
tuna dollars whatever ana

951
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:42,169
uh... very fancy u_s_ pewter you can buy

952
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:47,269
micro why i've done my christy i like
that we can just get nasty card for

953
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:54,269
and fifteen uh... whenever

954
00:44:07,669 --> 00:44:09,269
yeah so uh...

955
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:10,759
nickerson uh...

956
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:12,619
that you can modify

957
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,509
i guess the hardware modify

958
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:17,109
that the usb

959
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:18,209
device

960
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:19,909
to prevent it from from writing

961
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:22,569
which is um...

962
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:26,349
and a little uh... in time considering
circuit which is that

963
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:28,130
the things we do the company

964
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,869
you know that's that's what happens

965
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:32,169
uh... so that's a good option uh...

966
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,619
so it's it's not by the plus side but
the problem is the undoing it you have

967
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:36,200
to like

968
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,589
decide our pre sought or whatever likho

969
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:41,179
labels back in so if you wanna

970
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,609
yeah puts the back on the you dealer

971
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:48,679
susan easy option on there's a switch
there's a spot

972
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:50,029
and

973
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:53,460
uh... is a very a very good design the
date you know it says it is an arrow

974
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,950
that points the direction of the law

975
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,549
uh... this particular one

976
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:00,929
so well done uh... yahoo up

977
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:03,749
yeah it's crazy it's critical

978
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:04,730
at the box

979
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:09,429
it's that so uh... that i'd ask this is
the mic rested after

980
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:12,720
it's one of us think that's probably in
the standard says this should work

981
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,680
but you know people implement flashdrive
readers

982
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,549
uh... his standards

983
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:21,270
they reverse engineered this is the you
know the hardware somebody else in china

984
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,999
and uh... just you know all will stopper

985
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:25,429
twenty bucks cheaper

986
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:28,279
and who's going to complain about how
much flashdrive breeder doesn't do this

987
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:30,879
because i paid five dollars portly
cannot

988
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:33,709
or i shifted over from c_e_o_ overseas
so

989
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:37,899
they get out so some of them support of
some of them don't either

990
00:45:37,899 --> 00:45:38,750
a couple

991
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,559
in preparation for the sock and tested
them

992
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:47,559
all they wanted work about what the one
i'm using

993
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,729
too many things

994
00:45:49,729 --> 00:45:50,799
which is

995
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:52,779
sucking as my little

996
00:45:52,779 --> 00:45:55,429
adapter that this was like five dollars

997
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:58,019
and i bought uh... when i got the flash

998
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:00,440
microspheres came with that

999
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,339
and uh... that minnie s deducted so that

1000
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:05,689
this whole all set up here

1001
00:46:05,689 --> 00:46:07,750
thirty box forty bucks but it's not

1002
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,159
is expensive

1003
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:11,819
so yeah if you looked at

1004
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:12,899
renounce it

1005
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:14,609
usb of um...

1006
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,869
card reader says okay it's locked now

1007
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:18,149
and you know

1008
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:20,329
it's year opry system can answer

1009
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:24,329
there also usb locks in the operating
system but i figured hey the

1010
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:27,109
i'm sorry i soon baby what might be

1011
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:28,619
few disabled

1012
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,290
i can't say that share

1013
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,910
i haven't tested that much but there is
there's the registry key this is not

1014
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,389
rebuilding

1015
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:37,639
that just becomes a little bit painful
as

1016
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,729
if you set it like that to be doing
stuff you sent to read only when you

1017
00:46:40,729 --> 00:46:43,400
leave and then you know you get a colin
expect a

1018
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,700
i can't back up my stuff you've thrown g
so this is a much easier much cheaper

1019
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,079
much quicker option

1020
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,439
soviet it's thanks

1021
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,489
we don't in this thinking stuff

1022
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:59,469
assistance food the title for a talk
uh... but that's exactly what i was

1023
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:00,839
there for him to hear

1024
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,889
uh... so if you want to run stuff and
it's all kit

1025
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:06,349
but you don't want to run the native
garment

1026
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:09,869
because it's infected young forensics or

1027
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,199
for whatever reason you know when
they're on system because you're afraid

1028
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,369
of life

1029
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:14,749
yeah them on two nd stuff

1030
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,099
if happy doing talk it

1031
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,229
and another way

1032
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:20,240
i'm all about just you know trying to
figure out that was around things

1033
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,350
so party

1034
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,079
i mentioned earlier

1035
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,529
most the stuff naked time toolkit

1036
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:26,329
in here

1037
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:29,139
it comes to a lot of stuff already

1038
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:31,339
uh... you can also run it under wine

1039
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,219
and looks how repeat muscle

1040
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:36,929
analytics diplomats wine at some point
it's it's awesome

1041
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:38,399
it's like that

1042
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:40,679
analysts say it's like to see glenn

1043
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:42,159
why in our

1044
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,139
their similar it comes to do the things
that

1045
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:46,899
so in let x

1046
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:51,719
because a lot of the live distributions
lennox yeah you can run some of these

1047
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:52,699
tools

1048
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:54,219
in uh...

1049
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:56,229
and wine anime

1050
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:56,960
open

1051
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,020
well love a lot of time was going to
democrat but it's not that fancy

1052
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,110
you hit wine

1053
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,839
and then the execute it was also the
fight you can view

1054
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,280
and uh... you know if it has the
resources and wine

1055
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,990
to bring it up and it works great
because you can interact with a

1056
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,109
father-son as though it's going to
select

1057
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:14,189
you can access your it doesn't create a
virtual machine

1058
00:48:14,189 --> 00:48:18,140
you access the the the system that
you're all so you can access your files

1059
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,539
on it just seeing out like

1060
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:21,039
completely segregating

1061
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:23,299
so you can give you a lot of stuff uh...

1062
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:25,659
running it like i really love winters
that

1063
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:28,069
for anybody and you does any sort of
admin stuff

1064
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:32,350
and or just what the cream system
winters that examines all the files

1065
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,730
and then color codes them

1066
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,970
and categorize them by their type

1067
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:37,330
so idyllic hello

1068
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,180
why is this enormous posted just shot a
file

1069
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,619
and when the seven is just used

1070
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,899
thank you much

1071
00:48:43,899 --> 00:48:46,369
on the part that my shopping you know
use

1072
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:49,369
the sentences

1073
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:54,319
how do you have a podium sometimes it

1074
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,009
adding your naps

1075
00:48:58,009 --> 00:48:58,930
so windows

1076
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,029
distant stars

1077
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:02,019
in that directory

1078
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:03,999
statically compiled binaries

1079
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,399
to cool thing to do

1080
00:49:05,399 --> 00:49:08,409
you bring stuff with you fact they
compile basically means gonna pull in

1081
00:49:08,409 --> 00:49:10,569
all the resources it needs to run

1082
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:12,329
without you

1083
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,050
without relying on that the system so
for and that this kind of cool work

1084
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:16,879
you know you want

1085
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:19,559
to bring that cap with the without
having to

1086
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,780
compiler excuses the compile free

1087
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,309
what if they don't have gcc

1088
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:25,429
it happens

1089
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,989
you've got the stuff with you

1090
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:28,279
uh... scripts

1091
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:34,669
python scripts a lot of tools that we
use a written in suffolk icon pro sir

1092
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:37,319
uh...

1093
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:38,839
of

1094
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:43,969
wonder

1095
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:46,899
yes this is a crazy waterman

1096
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:49,889
cossacks i don't know

1097
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:53,269
i don't doubt on the other mentioned
before i have the book anchor

1098
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:59,019
and that's what my views done like the
minimal testing i've done it's got

1099
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:01,999
ten point four

1100
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,319
bridgette's what's right

1101
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:05,369
so that's like that's as far as i've
gotten with it

1102
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,089
i've been talking with some people
online that'd

1103
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,309
kind of been pushing me down that path
and missing some stuff but

1104
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:14,819
i dot just i just don't mess with it so
i'd love to have more stuff for or sex

1105
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:18,909
in here

1106
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:20,750
yes that's a great question dot

1107
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,979
put that in mind that somewhere and i
keep not looking down

1108
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,039
he asked his are less sex

1109
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,129
from with with the time

1110
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:31,859
it's if the most of these are compiled
for intel platforms

1111
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:35,289
so if you're trying to do some spark you
know this at most this that's going to

1112
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:38,449
work in the spring windows on the spark
which i have no idea at this

1113
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:39,829
even doable

1114
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:45,619
that big investment microsoft

1115
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:49,179
affects those parts gets you can run it
on and so far

a very sober computer

1134
00:51:43,629 --> 00:51:47,429
esprit much their mindset it sober look
at this l_c_d_ owed you want to use

1135
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:49,249
their operate system now

1136
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:53,950
i can run you know can run the software
on its uh... whatever i'm been install

1137
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:57,769
windows but it's it's i mean it's got

1138
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:00,300
uh... so yes use mentioned that you
cannot

1139
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,159
access a lot of the stuff from the
windows sidenote sex

1140
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:06,299
host filesystem for for

1141
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:09,619
are from exciting windows on a mac

1142
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:11,010
a less excited so

1143
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,480
that's one thing consider com

1144
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,440
i think that there are less export
herbal stuff

1145
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,049
it uh... i don't think many people in

1146
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:18,170
looked at

1147
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:25,170
i'm certainly not gonna be the
individual

1148
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:32,069
this door lock just

1149
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,609
that's commitment

1150
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,760
uh... what's left behind on the system's
just

1151
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,299
you know yet

1152
00:52:38,299 --> 00:52:41,819
the access logs you know from running i
think it's portable it easy as you know

1153
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:43,460
you're not messing with the resources

1154
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,289
well for sure with the resource running
and

1155
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,060
the sun

1156
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,219
la environments

1157
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:50,069
or not the live in harmony

1158
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:51,069
toolkit side

1159
00:52:51,069 --> 00:52:55,019
so you know you have access logs the usb
history neck was talking about that

1160
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:56,400
uh... that although it like

1161
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,760
profile information for usb device

1162
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,459
uh... buries the fingerprints uh...
forensics

1163
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:06,059
that's that's always there eighty logs
even if you have a right block

1164
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,799
they're starting to say oh i found the
thing that's the biggest right blocking

1165
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,240
it's great for me

1166
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,259
it doesn't stop it doesn't prevent you
from

1167
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:16,550
from blocking suffragist prevents it
from deleting today no actually in

1168
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,440
and i forgot that i've done this from
awhile back but

1169
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,480
i put the sipped versions of a lot of
tools in there

1170
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,759
is that kept getting deleted witnesses
year ago

1171
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:27,329
but they were legacies

1172
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,119
because it has been delayed its i'd like

1173
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,520
go back in a depleted and i go back in
the creek shocked everything so that's

1174
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,780
why some of those of you looking around
to see some of them zip files smaltz cuz

1175
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,379
the a_b_'s were picking up is that
there's

1176
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:42,389
that's a very complex where tak calls if
it

1177
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,249
and unzip it maybe what they would find

1178
00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:46,900
uh... external sources you know

1179
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,479
network logs onto some stuff they're not
walking

1180
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:56,059
uh... i've pretty much talked about all
stings

1181
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,219
mobile device is the thing that

1182
00:53:58,219 --> 00:54:00,070
before so that's why

1183
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,140
micro esti

1184
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,959
holly people's phones use my christy

1185
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:07,749

whatever it's the same

1194
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:30,789
up so i think the really cool

1195

1225
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:22,779
filter never probably like at times

1226
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:23,160
that's wild
