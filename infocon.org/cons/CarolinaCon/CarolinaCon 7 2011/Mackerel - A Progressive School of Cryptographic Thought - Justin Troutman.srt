1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,159
there are guys uh... goes all the talk

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,400
so they're crypto talk so freely you
crypto goes out there

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,750
some new stuff

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,440
um... they were to start off

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,929
this myself

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,209
a little bit about myself uh... uh...

7
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:12,989
actor

8
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:15,289
as a sign of life represent

9
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,229
presentation

10
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:19,530
so i had about uh... don't have to try
to get used to it

11
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,000
submerge

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,880
but

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,009
there

14
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,189
where she lives

15
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,280
action minorities

16
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,599
syringe or

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,059
salt reprieve but uh... figure

18
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:38,320
installs often

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,900
what it's like this one article

20
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,340
on its uh... i'll dump records are
pretty interesting occupation

21
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,550
now first of all those democrats are
covered

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,460
sewer breaking transmitted through
looking at that out room design

23
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,730
of the way these working real world
systems

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,780
album also this recently uh... level to
call implicit media advocate anti-media

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,520
pharma national little instrument for
actual but or two minutes ago

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,670
um... slowly work on their special happy
as a buffer between the media and

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,570
security research industry

28
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,220
uh... well you know you reluctant to do
list and big media very general stuff a

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,620
lot of cool stuff

30
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,780
mature about it

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,299
you know like a black and consulates
those really meet this doesn't make it

32
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,730
out there in public so we look for that
kind of thing

33
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,570
and try to represent that research

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,080
there's truthfully as we possibly can to
get out there stuff that that people

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,770
need to know if there was no sooner
because of me

36
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,960
of the gap between the general consumer
in the researcher

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,150
uh... this deal idea of

38
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,020
what i've done over the past five years

39
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,750
job back in two thousand section of
sales contract by marcus off to look at

40
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,690
bill lockyer

41
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,210
and i care don't print

42
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,820
now i have a conversation with malice
ferguson luker designed to fit for bruce

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,689
schneier

44
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,619
he was more than

45
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,420
co two sides of the locker

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,210
and uh... we want to do is sit down and
look at

47
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,900
you know how well this captures
cryptographic

48
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,229
goals in the real world

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,300
you know they're such a more tax was
served it turned out to be worse

50
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,210
in a cold with attraction ram

51
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,469
uh... that were nasa relevant to crypt
are cute but we also looked at the

52
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,299
cryptography implementation

53
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:11,769
and uh... in ahead at that time i had to
give some props to microsoft for going

54
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:15,299
up and what's really dipper talk first
because that's what they need

55
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:18,889
they'll have the best track records
arose with security

56
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,689
sorrow appease uh... about uh... blocker
and and

57
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,559
it offered i would call and somebody
that knew a little bit about

58
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,930
uh... cryptographic software

59
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,019
now everybody's familiar with phil
zimmerman pgp

60
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,029
has been to achieve something for it

61
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:34,540
once-in-a-lifetime okay

62
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,859
ever revoked achiever sign if you
probably shouldn't have

63
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,199
mel

64
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,150
are utterly starbucks here with a bs
probably the champion of champions on

65
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,159
privacy

66
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,729
ass all possible links to have to talk
to the plate but we can come to an idea

67
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:49,340
what's

68
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,349
watson who say that he's been through
quite a bit with f_b_i_ in

69
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:59,349
the crypto warns of export in a
regulations and all that sort

70
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,459
and really co-opted airhead computers a
div

71
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,780
uh... seven away

72
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,689
actions for black and six

73
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,469
uh... work at duke university

74
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,019
now their program there called the tide
invocation program politic gifted

75
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,749
students uh... as far down as a faint
fourth and fifth grade i got to work

76
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:17,859
with uh... fifteen sixteen seventeen
girls

77
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,099
i want to put together a hands on
curriculum an idea was to give them a

78
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:22,460
broader scope of what

79
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,089
electrical fields about the case
drenched in pursuing that the future

80
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:29,679
as opposed to this title group network
of caesar suffers a box office but

81
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,339
actually row world stuff

82
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,629
misconduct use of multiple disciplines
like computer science

83
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,899
a mathematics

84
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:36,590
and uh...

85
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,849
who follows cryptogram personal

86
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,819
so you're probably familiar with his

87
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,389
as recent work on psychologist shirdi

88
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,459
sociology of security so that's that's
really move up to come into along with

89
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,060
the economics of security

90
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,359
it takes in a a broad spectrum dispose

91
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:55,739
so that was really cool thing to work
well

92
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,589
and other style to be a little bit about
uh... reprint darkly

93
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,439
and the project now called mackerel

94
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,969
and this will spur development working
alongside vincent rodman

95
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,819
he'll most secure designer of arrived
all which would all become the bastard

96
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,099
purchaser

97
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:13,699
so uh... like it or not we all use of
mastercard for standard one e-commerce

98
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,239
platform annulled

99
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,870
so maybe we talked about that's personal

100
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,429
i bring photography

101
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:23,110
uh... what what we looked at that time
was

102
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,180
you know as everybody knows when
security falls part of practice or

103
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,699
special equipped are free

104
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,960
it's really not because the math itself

105
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
is because their completion password

106
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,449
things usually go wrong

107
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:36,209
uh... regardless what we're talking
about secured

108
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,189
so i want to examine at this time was

109
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,379
you know where were things for a while
revell a person who many pork

110
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,430
rhetorically

111
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,509
what we found is that with the abundance
of walks are first record respectful at

112
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,069
fourteen today

113
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,879
uh... you have like twelve or thirteen
block ciphers everything under the sun

114
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,729
really

115
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,089
and what happens when the pathology
other it complicates and the more

116
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,039
complex accord is obviously the hardest
analyze

117
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,169
so want to try to develop a framework

118
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,699
uh... for you know securely implementing
uh... only the bird central what's in it

119
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,340
what what type of goals should you look
for

120
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,669
and what can you do

121
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,910
to achieve those goals of the market

122
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,680
uh... because you don't wanna over to
the crib talk through the map is already

123
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,120
do

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,090
we've perfected the mass to such a

125
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,860
hikes that were not breaking comes
likely houston wrecking implementation

126
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,210
so the focus should be on the
compensation

127
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,219
asla greeenpro

128
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:27,269
rhetorical

129
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:30,580
you know so cryptographic assurance you
know we think the shirts we think of

130
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,479
accountants and implementations of us
were grim carter stepped in

131
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,060
we got to thinking about restart
macropod

132
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,399
uh... last year

133
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,250
you know it's not just about
supplementation

134
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,599
it's about the excessive built into the
consumer

135
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:43,890
implementation

136
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,430
security only pays attention to what the
gap between creek talkers and developers

137
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,330
what about the consumer what about the
usability of software like teaching p

138
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,500
so we'll talk a little bit about

139
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,289
you know excess bill to problems that
are just as much of a plate to security

140
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,089
and immigration problems

141
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,800
and also alignment

142
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,340
and we're dealing with the relationship
between photography of communication

143
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,849
specifically a model as big as the
internet

144
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,330
you know where to script order fee and
security statement

145
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,999
at a model that is so vast wasn't built

146
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,849
the security of mine from the forefront

147
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:17,860
so all through those things combined

148
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,009
and we're trying to build a big picture
look

149
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,680
at how developers should go about
security

150
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,509
out to make it you know fruitful in
practice to realize the theory mccur

151
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:27,850
parker sent out

152
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,250
and also make it usable understand why
the concern

153
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,939
and uh... special

154
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,759
you know guest if you're on the papers a
branch no

155
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,299
has every right before

156
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:38,149
a former

157
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,460
uh... temple director of finance and
information search director

158
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,400
now what's really cold up here on this
one is like an essay they have this

159
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,550
the guy bad guy

160
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,729
relationship with security measure

161
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:49,849
essay has

162
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,069
has the upper hand really you know we
publish everything in the open so they

163
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,089
have access to everything we publish

164
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,449
everything they publish

165
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,899
in a sale on the other hand

166
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,430
they have access to what they publish

167
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,400
so they always

168
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,779
you have a little bit more work within
reason

169
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,929
and and we've never really liked that
secrecy because in strictly to help

170
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,549
sarokin role

171
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:12,490
the publishing univ delays will build
his exports would beef up the field

172
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,069
their body on the same page

173
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,090
so it's really cool about him

174
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,930
you know why does it do away in a city
secrets obviously

175
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,689
uh... he does shed some light on on
things that he learned at the address of

176
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,270
the things that we can learn

177
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,949
you know the consumer industry about how
to build better software

178
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,569
so i will talk about

179
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,939
all right so what is macro

180
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,449
basically analogs with joint work with
us

181
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,030
uh... it's a design para

182
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,189
you know when you look at my actors like
a fish maybe conflicting fish blowfish

183
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:42,800
might

184
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,129
misconstrued i think it's a block
suffered

185
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,349
uh... but uh... as you

186
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:49,929
uh... fish names were used or warts and
to name a trip to traffic suffered as a

187
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:50,919
critical time

188
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,520
there's a reason behind back around
until later

189
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,890
but it is a design paradigm

190
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,830
it's not an algorithm

191
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,130
it's a framework to put together a
disorder guy developers wages to build a

192
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,559
better blueprints for how to go about
approach crypto if it were world systems

193
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:07,689
it is built on best practice in
standards and one of the doles

194
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:10,710
before even start the project you know
if i had a design anything new

195
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,749
whatsoever holes into it

196
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:16,589
as anybody knows uh... photography
textile garments balls anything means

197
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:18,199
you have to go through scrutiny

198
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,089
spent eight years and years to develop

199
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,079
and i felt that we already had
everything we needed a place

200
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,879
this had to find a better way to package
it

201
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,949
and get out there

202
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,249
the folks in the

203
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:33,069
what macros not discover that it's not a
cryptographic but doesn't prepare

204
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:34,460
authenticate things

205
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,339
uh... it's not algorithmic by any means
assist a framework for using all these

206
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,160
things

207
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,550
properly and securely

208
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,920
nothing homegrown nothing radical told
based on stuff we trust account for

209
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,060
mister for decades

210
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,520
parts of evolution

211
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,240
of macro

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,470
of seven await

213
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,690
more project looking at the chernobyl
script hartford that's published with

214
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,090
uh... i tripoli security privacy

215
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,310
and they're here religion yet

216
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,400
taking very strong photography

217
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,120
and minimalist ideas for implementing
the happy you know what's

218
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,589
the cheapest way we can write

219
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,540
the fumes lines of killing to get the
script archery into practice and achieve

220
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,440
all the goals you want to achieve

221
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,620
there are certain motions of security
documents and not touch on some other

222
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,620
very technical her mathematics

223
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,660
not really relevant

224
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,840
too that the high-level mackerel

225
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,260
okaloosa county do not uh... what

226
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,900
common protocols like yes it's a chess
itself

227
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,140
and where they stand

228
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,280
you know the cryptographic side of
things

229
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,750
uh... drinker talking

230
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,480
doctor with a little bit earlier

231
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,790
i would show that was the the first real
realization of mature man with

232
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,010
photography

233
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,490
and i do know there was to recycle
whenever moreover possible

234
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,499
not many folks know till easter

235
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,590
through my experience working with
developers

236
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,640
that you can use in christian functions
also for authentication

237
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,420
and what we call a message
authentication code

238
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,240
was nice about that is when you're

239
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,519
looking at implementation already has a
blocks are for like two prescription

240
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,890
standard for instance

241
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,670
uh... you can use that for a correction
authentication very secure composition

242
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,840
to achieve

243
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,260
confidentiality integrity without it
were about hash functions or

244
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,070
wheels will block ciphers are cascades
blocks like this you can achieve that

245
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,580
the best that we have

246
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,320
wheels are going to all the trouble

247
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,810
and i will try to instill developers
about times that

248
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,330
your transcript as cold as it is it
offers dozens of of choice is to improve

249
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,030
it is not necessary

250
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,760
and a lot of developers on talk to the
outside of the trooper principle we we

251
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,620
want to implement what they didn't want
and they want more

252
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,410
morbid small that we'll hash functions
more cheerful

253
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,980
morgan that there was well should use is
me making cryptographic decisions in the

254
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,170
first place

255
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,010
and i think it should be secure buffalo

256
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,870
it like

257
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,210
universal feelings but

258
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,010
you know we have a standard investor
purchased and i want to talk about the

259
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,850
comparison to fish serpent

260
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,690
some rather popular cannons

261
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,440
and uh... try to total some
misconceptions about which was more

262
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,840
secure in religious terms notion from

263
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,560
now we have secure standards

264
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,200
and we should use them whatever more
possible because the best of the best

265
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,480
ability sends and looked at them

266
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,779
and interpret or if you really is still
and art and science

267
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,780
you know we base our security all things
that we can't prove

268
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,550
uh... based on our knowledge it's it's
pretty good so we have to go with that

269
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,630
we have two trucks

270
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,060
trust experts

271
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,470
in their opinions on of these problems
that we base our security

272
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,269
and uh...

273
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,069
really cool mackerel i'm glad to be here
come on a constant first i want to bring

274
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:27,120
that

275
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,180
i want to do that for a couple reasons
uh...

276
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,610
uh... you know you guys here in this
audience who

277
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,790
very intimate

278
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,100
of dealing with security with us

279
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,360
itself

280
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,020
account subtotal must live thus black
and white sir

281
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,260
at cisco

282
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,639
whether not

283
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,270
the actress mechanics okay

284
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,640
absurd

285
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,490
anywhere rosa

286
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,330
a macro carolina ka there

287
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,400

00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,459
elbows distracting

289
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,660

290
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,100
anyway

291
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,920
goldenthal one by the serb side

292
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,800
uh... you know you guys worked very
intimately

293
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,040
exports of all the realtors you work
hands on security

294
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,370
but it will pass this to an executive
conference to managers anything like

295
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,810
that i want to get the feedback from the
people who actually doing thirty work

296
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,360
with kevin to see what you think you
need ideas any

297
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,910
the things you wanted about any problems
you've had

298
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,280
misconceptions maybe ten

299
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,200
sartre look for some feedback appletalk

300
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,120
uh... but uh... kerala karna small
states owns an extra

301
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,340
in a proud to present this year

302
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,990
ambassador to the first group

303
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,770
non-medical

304
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,880
so

305
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,450
uh... boarded up the store and i was
like there was some concern

306
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,140
our insurance this is the first of the
trial like this

307
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,980
they're looking at mackerel

308
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,920
we're psyched about insurance you know
first when you look at

309
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,480
the role of herzog referring to roll
developer

310
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,310
groups are for deals with syria

311
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,830
we consider developer

312
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,730
deals of practice so we can simplify it
that way for this purpose

313
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,570
assurance means that we're taking

314
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,990
what we were caught there

315
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,350
and were translating it into practice

316
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,760
and successes

317
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,060
and security of working up there

318
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,300
so it's a successful

319
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,150
example of the shirts if we can put you
back

320
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,910
competence implementations

321
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,030
uh... you know i have a pre-req europa
conversation brunch no

322
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,620
every other week or so to talk about the
latest of mister industry

323
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,620
uh... you know some government stuff
nothing

324
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,470
implants pops limit

325
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,029
he talks a lot about competence of
notations on them

326
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,530
throttle poetry

327
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,000
later but

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,900
uh... indian government systems is ideal
you know we can't beta test

329
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,720
are our customers because of something
fails will back

330
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,670
so confidence is not something

331
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,600
has pretty much uh... eluded to it but

332
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,260
your confidence in our shirts wasn't
option

333
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,010
it was something that was a
pre-requisite

334
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,820
it before

335
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,200
and security systems at this

336
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,720
and uh... better to have to look at the
branch dominate improvement built

337
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,230
in several of the party

338
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,150
and insurance is meant to develop

339
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,680
address to the the gap between

340
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,440
print our prison developers photography
lover so carton size

341
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,730
even if you have

342
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,950
you know if your eyes and algorithms
that are standardizing

343
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,770
go to work with

344
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,000
we did the it's a case by case basis
when you do with particular system

345
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,870
sometimes

346
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,530
different rooms won't fit

347
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,580
you have to go to a small however the
movie change things around

348
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,540
that always work

349
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,940
it's not black and white like you might
think it is

350
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,830
so it's very subtle and we can expect
developers to know these things because

351
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,990
they're their code gurus are not the
party

352
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,040
everybody has their expertise so it's up
to curb tartar firms there guys like me

353
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,230
to do the research in that field

354
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,690
to cater to develop and it's uh... they
shouldn't be them

355
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,570
and kind of standing in the dark for
reborn development things were wrong

356
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,149
simpson

357
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:57,900
you know to which tree

358
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,660
parts of the error when i was a lack of
a shirt since cured

359
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,570
unfortunately when you think about other
types of software or returns for

360
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,710
functionality

361
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,020
things at work properly if this than
that we can't beta test for security

362
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,850
and i can do and i can say

363
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,480
uh... this entire presentations been
recruited and brought twenty six

364
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,910
and diverse excess telecom and it is
roughly six

365
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,540
but it's not very secure work properly

366
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,330
but uh...

367
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,589
the more opportunity

368
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:28,060
absurd

369
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,990
but that now you got to get the idea of
things to work properly

370
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,580
but on the serbs securely

371
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,300
okay brownstone from two thousand five
paper he wrote for keynote speech we

372
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,610
need insurance

373
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,900
brian said howled functions and
assurances and security device with an

374
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,720
update it s on the customer

375
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,350
if not products will someone die

376
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,690
you know and and

377
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,470
the security industry as a recent talk a
lot guilty that it should have

378
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,910
um... in nsi acted ako imagine what will
happen if you're behind the code

379
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,720
uh... that uh... whether someone with
your life you know i'm not sure what

380
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,289
they're

381
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:04,000
their policies are there but

382
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,930
you know i kind of like we need to lean
more towards this this idea

383
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,830
to assume pip we're gonna die

384
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,550
you know if microsoft word crashes

385
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,100
probably not going to happen

386
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,000
but uh...

387
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,940
but though that would be a bad better to
do but i wouldn't be a bad way to look

388
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,280
at design

389
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,120
but the fact that it was pretty falls
apart it was a long

390
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,740
about that

391
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,130
sure ed you know it wasn't

392
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,399
another quote from brian

393
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,389
of assault course tradition of days at
about the same state is the auto

394
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:35,520
industry was in the nineteen thirties

395
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,470
lots performance little safety

396
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,310
postcards and software admissions
relations

397
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,290
so it's it's really need to look at

398
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,050
did if an example of different
industries the car insurance

399
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,509
and there's so many parallels we control
between different

400
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,940
you know areas of the district

401
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,590
and security i think we need to do that
it's time that we look at other

402
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,610
disciplines

403
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,470
the better security

404
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,990
would be surprised at how intertwined
different sciences or would start

405
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,739
looking at

406
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:03,060
the process for going about safety and
security

407
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:10,060
the questions

408
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,970
of course

409
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,880
and i i i think was

410
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,440
script or constricting him

411
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,650
you know when you look at standards in
the corporate interests against

412
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,900
americans come into play between

413
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,610
independent research field of government
supporters of corporations

414
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,150
it's gonna take a lot of work and and
anything for carter takes a long time to

415
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,670
mature takes a lot of times tenable
discussing ideas everybody's got their

416
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,230
hands on

417
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,660
so i think in that case you're
absolutely right and we can't

418
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,980
wicked ralph directly from things we
can't look at exactly what they did

419
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,679
expected to translate

420
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,679
and some things may not work

421
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,930
sure exactly

422
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,660
so many obviously final translate

423
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,680
you know plea

424
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,500
darlie is worth taking a look at saying
you know what does

425
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,180
and it's fun for topic you know

426
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,660
all right uh... the crypt are for
developer to and as i said earlier acr

427
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,190
towers versatile

428
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,400
uh... for example cbc mode very strong
but it's it's secure have chosen points

429
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,710
at the time on

430
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,920
as per the most widely used walks off
providers from her with the proper use

431
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,630
that one time or another

432
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,850
and then i think the real world system i
think rips up and listen to say that

433
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,820
you're going to get confidentiality

434
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,970
as always the case western bill network
traffic

435
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,970
uh... steve bell of one

436
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,830
in a big job security

437
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,340
really champion through

438
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,870
the demonstrated you know early nineties
in the nineties taxing

439
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,130
pre-selected words out adversaries were
able to read perfect record

440
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,010
by exploiting the issue of the
concentration was applied

441
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,860
so we'll talk a little bit more about

442
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,470
encryption authentication also the cases
that forgot about element

443
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,379
that's probably even more important some
cases in the creek

444
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:57,930
present perfect fall apart completely

445
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,630
so things like that we can expect a vote
person who's very cryptography

446
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,550
it was too deep level math

447
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,480
computer science about the way you

448
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,020
in a force messages when you get
progresses

449
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,930
so this is the kind of thing when you
get up to filters

450
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,060
uh... front sign papers quite clear that
the christian without integrity checking

451
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,450
at all but useless

452
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,300
we strongly urge all systems

453
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,330
uh... to use the two options

454
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,850
through a strong quote from ninety-six

455
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,070
we live in brazil for about a year and
while i was there a project

456
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,760
mostly american canadian companies

457
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,310
uh... developers of cryptographic
software

458
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,930
and what i did as i looked at small
independent

459
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,000
companies where you could kill someone
mentions skeptical game to develop

460
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,190
you know calendars and it does happen
like retard officially threw together a

461
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,330
little creek tartar free outdoors now
and i thought or

462
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,000
then i went to the mid-level guys who
actually had a nice whipsawed sweetu

463
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,020
cryptographic products and they use

464
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,150
standards lots of those words and i went
to the big guys like pgp

465
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,500
you know and i asked him questions about
a christian ossification acid

466
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,990
you know this this is a mission on their
site you know you don't mention anything

467
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,120
about

468
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,410
uh... authentication which acclaimed to
achieve integrity

469
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,680
i would say goodnight five percent
response i got back was another week

470
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,140
either do not know what a mac over the
news from ur suffocation

471
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,520
uh... there has been a demand fort we
thank our implementation of the

472
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
personally to serve that purpose

473
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
a lot of different answers and some
didn't respond at all

474
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,120
you know this election under six adidas
study a couple years ago

475
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,030
and out of about forty forty five to
fifty people that i interviewed

476
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,250
difficulties from small to large one and
two

477
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,660
to be corporations

478
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,450
only the biggest in the best of the
corporations and actually have the money

479
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,450
to go up higher good security people
good professionals to put our first

480
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,040
you have a clue what i was talking about
little implement properly

481
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,640
so there is definitely a gap

482
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,830
and there's no do you think about you
know for example from one to practice

483
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,010
medicine today have to go through a
whole

484
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,019
scheme of things to practice medicine i
couldn't open up the clinical

485
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,500
the silence reappeared

486
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,560
so offering

487
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,909
into the medical advice and go into that
sort but encrypt are filled mine

488
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:05,250
anybody who has basically can develop
software consult

489
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,680
they can use all of those words and mud
why not use admits using military grade

490
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,810
photography

491
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,350
one million bikinis

492
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,020
within a city crime released this buzz
words like that

493
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,299
you know why not use it and that uh...
for looks at the developer to consumer

494
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,700
debt

495
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,990
equally important

496
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,710
hart uh... total bring photography

497
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,390
extension

498
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,130
records are fairly ends to simplify the
implementation process for developers

499
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,840
and sampled for analysis

500
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,050
full implementation itself

501
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,430
but i do here's all this would make
things easy as possible for

502
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,890
developer to understand

503
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,940
into interface with the come to
understand what the card for the need of

504
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,320
how to do about it

505
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,920
you know hidden unit and things along
the way

506
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,030
because implementation is worth and
usually do wrong

507
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,480
we want to simplify the analysis that
the place as much as possible

508
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,170
interpret our fee

509
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,430
it's great stuff with them tuition

510
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,390
is faulty

511
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,440
you can get around tower so that's
really where the focus should be

512
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,640
people tend to become paranoid about the
carpet worry about

513
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,310
n_s_a_ would rather capabilities like
that

514
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,419
examples like different sorts of
petition to fall apart

515
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:17,640
every other day public as a big brother
but because of simple exports to japan

516
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,340
automatic and in a matter of seconds

517
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,539
sobering photography

518
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,910
first recycle whenever and wherever
possible

519
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,440
encryption authentication

520
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,290
unicycles interject him i think of a
crash function ashok says that there was

521
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,669
no problem using

522
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:36,080
if you use the standard

523
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,700
but we want it protects them from her
can we get by with one purpose

524
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,930
so we looked at the massacre to standard

525
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,210
maybe a little boxes i was working with
him to run on this project echo

526
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,929
developer

527
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,200
oblivious

528
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,050
but uh... you know if it was in the
center people familiar with the so we'll

529
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,170
do it

530
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,670
everyone to make sure

531
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,980
tipton

532
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,750

533
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,230

534
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,090
protect legitimate companies

535
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,660
water

536
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,480
it

537
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,529
alkyl

538
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:22,529
art so recycle

539
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,850
that

540
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,120
just i could smell a little different
illegal

541
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,330
discounted

542
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,140
i don't know what what

543
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,800
mclean has some good effect sir

544
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,220
recycle whenever wherever possible

545
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,200
we looked at the restaurant instead

546
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,970
and we know we found that it was that
was known to occur tartars bert bert com

547
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,400
thing

548
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,429
what we call a couple generic opposition

549
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,890
what this is a way to combine decryption

550
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,590
and also the cation again

551
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,810
and the benefit of this is when you

552
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,390
you can either authenticate first
democratic refers to the also the case

553
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,510
or encrypt and authenticate separately

554
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,989
and they're different security

555
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:06,139
notions to prolonged with this but a
crippling first than authenticated

556
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:08,260
psychic

557
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,190
you know what i believe to be the most
secure kristin stand at least likely to

558
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,910
go on practice

559
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,359
so we used a house

560
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,500
to the crips and and and a mac algorithm
to authenticate

561
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,009
and this spin this form

562
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:22,400
in properly done of course using leslie
cbc mood

563
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,910
or you know for a mac using seem act

564
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,159
rome after one of the other standardized
forms

565
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,960
uh... misinterpretation

566
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,340
rebel to achieve indistinguishable to
under adaptive chosen

567
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,780
suffered heart attacks

568
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,830
and integrity of subjects and this is
really the strongest motions we have

569
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,900
available

570
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,450
uh... since about right

571
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,110
last decades with sort of things
developed in theoretical

572
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,200
uh... security notions of security

573
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,890
it's based on different models not
everybody agrees with that but we think

574
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,480
it's a good starting point to the way to

575
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
uh... to look at

576
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,809
you know what will happen if we throw
brought attacks over

577
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,360
a baseline metric

578
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,660
you know the roar of security

579
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,800
if we think about shows inside protects
attacks were bitter jesus octaves

580
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,330
complaint the soccer text

581
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,880
have a list of the crips architects just
using

582
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,400
and obviously do the same time plaintext

583
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,690
so there there by five miles to work
with the strongest which is involved

584
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,840
tops

585
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,259
uh... picture darkly

586
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:19,029
using only standard which frog clark
minimalist implementation

587
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:20,740
at a few maximus to go along with it

588
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,170
uh... you know i do a lot was a little
less is more

589
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,680
both little self coaching things to keep
us on track to make sure things was

590
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,260
cleaning it is possible

591
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,220
and i was with the goals to maximize
security

592
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,470
minimize conflict

593
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,960
uh... you know one thing we say the
cryptogram sulfur

594
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,809
typical true crippling

595
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:40,190
animals probably secure our paper use it

596
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,870
it's promising a following that

597
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,170
nor the software has since been g_p_

598
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,540
uh... but there's a lot but use dozens
of box office

599
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,920
several have talked about himself for
the bill to the cascades literally

600
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,680
problem tartan

601
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,890
and as a literal problems this is a

602
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,320
it it really addresses

603
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,390
you know i'm not problem

604
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,960
and that's beefing up the car really to
beef up its markets where it is very

605
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,010
secure

606
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,539
units were about to implementation

607
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,290
and more stuff is taken to an
implementation more complex it becomes

608
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,220
so that's really something which are the
pound into developers

609
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,290
as a you know the more photographers not
bitter

610
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,640
the fewer things havent inflation that's
where the real real world securities

611
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,190
connector

612
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,130
going back to

613
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,830
that composition when u encrypt

614
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,410
and this is something that stayed
elements as well

615
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,360
uh... when u crip

616
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,620
you should authenticated

617
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,100
that's a rule was released

618
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,009
no case um... you know when dealing with
this contraption

619
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,730
when you went on space

620
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,790
the idea of of putting it back tag
actual shocked excellent cipher text

621
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,560
that expands it and sometimes expansion
is not really

622
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,890
favor upon you're doing

623
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,980
desperately but there are certain ways

624
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,480
to go about that different modes of
operation

625
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,890
uh... that address will be called
granularity granularity

626
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,169
when you're thinking about

627
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:55,470
attacker being able to manipulate bits

628
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,630
of dr

629
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,940
which we have it seems like a lot but
it's it's a arrival or or the small

630
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,960
space

631
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,150
you're doing with segments of twenty
eight blocks along the way

632
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,750
he may be able to you know trophy bits
here and there without damaging

633
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,139
unit are sector

634
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:10,720
tardiness

635
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,100
so they looked at uh... supercar looked
at different ways to increase this

636
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,610
blocking using traditional box office
without wasting her time they've been

637
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,809
watched workers

638
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,630
like a drastic registered

639
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,150
and expand that to work over

640
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,690
you know maybe you know several thousand
that's worth a watch place

641
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,790
and by doing this

642
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,049
you know it's not a perfect wait for
authentication is not as ideals amak

643
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:36,450
what it does is it makes it more likely
that a manipulation will crash

644
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,370
by covering a larger amounts placed into
a attack briefings

645
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,170
recall that poor man's authentication
it's not really authentication buckled

646
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,180
it lessens the chance of disaster

647
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:53,180
should somebody try to break into it

648
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,960
subways

649
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,180
somewhat people to recover and from
small amounts manipulation with the ones

650
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,120
that cover larger

651
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,210
block sectors

652
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,900
hill idea there is it's a beautiful
diamond you kind of risk

653
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,590
using stop orders

654
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,970
you know at the expense of security

655
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,700
and that's one thing to do a lot to do

656
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,250
i have to look into more about that

657
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,340
in what they do to avoid that i have
some other bells mostly fitted with

658

marker

659
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,210
as far as interest platform our things
to make it

660
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,530
in a little more friendly

661
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,159
but uh... in a bit walker did that with
a eighty s and cibc

662
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:29,840

cryptography

665
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,390
it was about as good as well

666
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,790
you know without affecting performance
too much

667
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:43,100
assault such a little bit leaner

668
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,190
all right uh...

671
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,480
you know you're going to have a first
out rogue trader turkey generation

672
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,060
you will split those keys generate one
key source

673
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,860
split the keys the first africa shin
second half for authentication

674
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,760
it so it was a random strings

you could come back to make on that sock

00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,880

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,690
computer sophocles okay

687
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,440
compares it to a house-senate

688
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,309
if they match

689
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,830
than you havent

690
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,530
so this is really basic generic
opposition

691
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,950
uh... when years with standards used
properly this achieved the highest level

692
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,290
of security we have

693
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,110
for signature

694
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,160
encryption authentication

695
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,070
and there were several indian

696
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,150
and uh... substantial thailand did a lot
of work this than a decade ago

697
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,250
and there really were older ones working
on it but they're they're super smart

698
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,799
and really work hand-in-hand
cryptographic

699
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,750
theoretical sab

700
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,580
so it's really really as a trusted
generic opposition

701
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,390
a sense of doing things like uh...
provable security that's really

702
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,300
woes worsen adrift or if it's it's a
misnomer you know we really can't prove

703
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,580
security and the women what people might
think hun sometime

704
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,150
but we can prove that if we can break
away and we can also bring b

705
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,000
so when we look at

706
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,430
low-level primitives things like

707
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,779
you know what's offered something higher
level like

708
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:20,940
mode of operation

709
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,900
cibc

710
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,600
that uses that whatsoever

711
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,220
if we can break cbc using this tag which
also break day yes isn't

712
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,350
so that's really what the typical models
like this

713
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,470
unprovable secured

714
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,559
we can prove that

715
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,450
if this breaks

716
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,200
that's correct sona hundred-percent

717
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,070
supposed as we can

718
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,010
and finally for degree per car per side
you know we must consider surplus and

719
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,050
security

720
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,529
as mutually beneficial

721
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:48,400
into parts of system design

722
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,289
because security is not just about the
technology like talk for this going into

723
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,470
the attention

724
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,930
is just as much about implementation
itself

725
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,519
they're not dealing with theory for
delaware thirty only

726
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,529
interpret our fee

727
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:00,450
theorists

728
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,340
havent in a really good position

729
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,230
they can pick and choose their attackers
and to pick and choose a malls things

730
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,370
always work

731
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,650
great in theory

732
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,810
but dilemmas practice

733
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,800
practice it's an uphill battle things
worked against her and practice of real

734
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,940
world models

735
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,100
so that both of these things have to
work and uh...

736
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,360
peter dot and i think most you should

737
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,820
but not him from forty five perhaps
disquiet method

738
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,030
uh... back in a day

739
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,130
uh... he's from new zealand really
hardcore security dot

740
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,050
uh... values tavera or conversations
with him

741
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,049
he proposed uh...

742
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:36,110
security paradigm source there's only
one way in a secure and it's also the

743
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,700
easiest way to do

744
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,350
uh... are really an easy thing

745
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,570
during practice since it was more
well-disciplined so strongly to now

746
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,650
you're dealing with

747
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,649
who was the uh...

748
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:46,530
their consumers

749
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,370
user interface for doing this

750
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,580
like human-computer interaction

751
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,110
which in itself has nothing to security

752
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,120
but they look at how re interfaces
humans with different things with

753
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,170
technology

754
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,730
so it's important that we we reach out
to these other communities to look at

755
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:06,340
this time security and make a decent

756
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,170
right now i got the shirt so any
questions

757
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,770
bout shirts photography

758
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,330
oric says a built-in

759
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,290
uh... this is really the start of macro

760
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,790
you know we we look to the insurance for
students of history laws that was only

761
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,120
the store only

762
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,820
took care of the relationship between
photographers involved

763
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,310
with accessibility double inflation
actually has to be usable

764
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,519
um... alba whitney

765
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,970
research are now if you go to the study
back in

766
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,649
late ninety five two nine nine

767
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:41,070
it was cold why johnny can't encrypt it
was a usability study

768
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,370
of pgp

769
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,450
it she found that even those of the
first time to really m_p_t_p_ was a

770
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,090
great thing it was the first time we had
a interference from

771
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,580
for relief stroke a party

772
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,350
near ninety percent of research studies

773
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,970
either exported their secret can set the
somebody and it took the body that has

774
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,330
to do that

775
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,000
religious considerate public use of all
had a very select few people usually

776
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,659
undergraduate students people that

777
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:07,820
they were somewhat tech savvy you know
with those those interfaces of the day

778
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,070
a rebel to notify northrop is still too

779
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,049
in arkansas rule out of time ob

780
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:12,990
a period of time

781
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,860
people not to wait for them

782
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,970
you know and i was mackerel

783
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,610
we saw but no tie talent palatable
concert security should feel good to

784
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,150
taste

785
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,620
blackmun

786
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,890
uh... you know when dealing with
photography we have to look at ways

787
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,450
to not focus on the correction

788
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,660
concentration in a fresher grandmother
when christians should probably not

789
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,730
going on

790
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,110
but let me ask her what

791
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,110
confidentiality switches liberal i think
she's develop trust multipath

792
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,230
position as well

793
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,760
confidentiality is

794
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,630
you know what it's not

795
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,920
so she can relate the concept one

796
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,970
and these are the types of everyday
consumers are actually going to be using

797
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,399
insecure software

798
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:52,419
and we will make a transparent but we
also will make it clear why they made

799
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:53,440
the software

800
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,130
and what is going to do when i look at
their place with another look at it this

801
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,590
is going to provide confidentiality is
to provide integrity

802
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:06,590
but they did not worry about you know
description standard sanitation yes box

803
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,689
you know some unfortunate sort

804
00:34:10,689 --> 00:34:11,589
uncertainties

805
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:14,929
for us to developers securities usually
secondary

806
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:17,809
most people when they sit down to a
computer then i'll think about hard and

807
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,309
i'm sure you know that may be

808
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,649
very untrue for the people in this room

809
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:23,460
restoration commitment

810
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,659
first and i think about that

811
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,099
whether we sit on the computer

812
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,480
or warcraft lee

813
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,719
check email

814
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,859
some other things are probably shouldn't
mention

815
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:36,729
but uh... you know the first lady's
usually not security

816
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:40,029
inconvenience trump security over time
and that's one of things i talked about

817
00:34:40,029 --> 00:34:40,659
with

818
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,929
with mouse ferguson microsoft when they
were developing that walker

819
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,469
he said you know we could have

820
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:49,369
gone in above and beyond supercar
convicted of made things as ideal as

821
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:50,349
possible

822
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,949
but it was going to slow down the
process

823
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:55,479
wasn't interfaces victims

824
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:59,669
windows and given the users that use
windows in a regular basis

825
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:01,040
normally give a lot of time

826
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,689
you know when they're woodworking
different applications so

827
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:06,909
he said is going to slow things down to
such a point did you discover forget

828
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:09,749
about the critter noggin were about this
contraption

829
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:12,389
because of the lacking some slowdown
disk

830
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:13,459
at this time

831
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,440
and reading and writing

832
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,729
things of that sort

833
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:19,079
so attitude probably always will be true

834
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,719
in any design work harder for you it's
not there from the very beginning

835
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,189
security has always been a list of
things

836
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:28,569
and obviously it was difficult to use

837
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:30,629
users naka had an innovation

838
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,919
you know they're going to forget
security altogether

839
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:38,499
an album whitten has done uh... walk in
the early research

840
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:40,639
usability props and

841
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,829
secure software issues more people

842
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:44,419
that are expected to use it

843
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:48,059
are reliable aware of the security
sunita perform

844
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,119
they are able to figure out how
successfully to performance

845
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,279
those tests

846
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:54,609
uh... but only to make dangerous errors

847
00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:57,979
and they need to be sufficient
comfortable with interfaced

848
00:35:57,979 --> 00:36:00,159
dinner early principles that she set up

849
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,010
chart correct

850
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:01,999
pgp

851
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:04,000
and the other done some things here and
there but

852
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,290
largely research like this their
research like alan whitney

853
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,899
as prolific as they are in human
computer interaction

854
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:11,909
the security industry really has no idea

855
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:14,299
of the most partnerships are a lot of
research is that

856
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,699
you have no idea that i witnessed
partnered

857
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:17,669
afield

858
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:19,200
as important to security

859
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,779
as work harder first concedes addressing
the interfaces addressing

860
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:25,950
a point where users meet security

861
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,849
and this is just as important

862
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:33,779
you know as photographers are developing
beginning grocery that goes into that

863
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:37,039
so these four points are a really good
way

864
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,589
visceral baseline way to approach

865
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:40,939
usable design

866
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:44,309
we call this blueprint hartford
inaccessibility bloom sort of

867
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:47,619
international corporate sensible

868
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:50,839
with likud party will simplify the
conceptual model

869
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,220
we think and technical terms we think of
corruption

870
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,749
authentication

871
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:56,300
and conceptual terms

872
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,669
to look at this as confidentiality and
integrity

873
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:02,149
and this is a really crucial way uh...

874
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:06,119
myself superpower for interact with
someone human-computer interaction

875
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,769
because of their dilemmas concentra
don't tend to

876
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,859
in a palpable since things that are
going to make the user understand

877
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:13,449
what's going on so far

878
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:16,519
you know from our perspective on word
about the security of an hour interface

879
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:19,199
in san antonio these so when you come
together

880
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,119
i think this is worried me is taking

881
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,319
technical concepts or technical aspects
of that

882
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,269
internet into something central

883
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:32,529
uh... it obviously had more general the
concept is work sells for two days

884
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:35,639
folks like you and i have a problem with
the group cation

885
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,960
but we're so we can make it

886
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,519
more likely history

887
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:41,440
by concerns in practice

888
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,389
first things first transparency

889
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:45,959
users should be able to use the system
transport

890
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,999
as much as you can do behind the scenes
you know if you pay

891
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:50,699
you're actively cryptic now

892
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,249
you have to generate the keys

893
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:55,230
uh... there's still something to do a
lot of it we can do behind the scenes

894
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,439
it rather than expected

895
00:37:57,439 --> 00:38:00,759
to not go into a fit when i asked him to
peckham keyboard with the mouse around

896
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:03,379
generate randomness because in the
freaking out like

897
00:38:03,379 --> 00:38:06,679
not obvious it's it's it's not a very
natural thing to ask you for doing the

898
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,959
shaker mouse and bang on the keyboard

899
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,849
they already don't like the software
platform anyway

900
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:13,739
so transparency is key

901
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:16,979
and again easy

902
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:19,269
or

903
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:21,169
holster

904
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:22,419
netbook

905
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:28,749
for some into so what comes and that
that's insult

906
00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:31,170
no i don't feel a lot of research
fulfilled it

907
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,959
that users should be given crypto
decisions

908
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:37,569
and uh... you know i suppose total
different forms like soccer electric

909
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:38,749
reform

910
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,609
and a lot of users got pretty heated

911
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,580
lateral move in the casket a boxer
winter rents that made it seem like they

912
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,989
were directors have been answered

913
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:49,480
i think you could really literally see
the temple had skipped

914
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,559
i mean it was

915
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,809
ills hardcore they were already gone to
the booker before finish my calculation

916
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:57,789
so how did it was still a softened you
know it's like what what what is this

917
00:38:57,789 --> 00:38:59,529
breaks what if the breakfast

918
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:01,949
well if i a ten-block suckers

919
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:04,299
the politically correct the first line
of okay

920
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:06,869
i'm like well let's look at history for
some samples

921
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:07,739
let's look for things

922
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:12,549
leader on the back as thus far fourteen
you know within the

923
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:15,890
a lot of that you know the the neighbors
praised for secure for the time for whom

924
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,790
the secure

925
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,739
cryptographic devices university

926
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:19,950
but uh... user

927
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,589
a lot of things outside of court or
itself

928
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:25,960
you know the reason the things a little
bit broke

929
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,459
you know difference itunes

930
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:29,500
a lot of user

931
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,079
to find a way in

932
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,699
you know so

933
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:33,859
you shouldn't be

934
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:35,309
give grip of the system

935
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:38,619
and and we're trying to uh... to reside
at the show

936
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:41,059
the best decryption standard

937
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,639
the same type of folks are gonna believe
it is a standard

938
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,009
widely-used therefore must be taken some
weapons

939
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,720
and uh... you know i personally can say
all of the life of it

940
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,650
but there's been lots of good witness i
don't believe there is i don't think

941
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,569
there's

942
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:58,349
uh... eating certainly use from an essay
especially consider targets ocean

943
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:01,089
international field

944
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:02,440
print or it was intended

945
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,030
invented by americans including export
walls on cryptographic commitment it

946
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,899
seem like we're trying to keep my ass

947
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:09,709
within the borders the united states

948
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:12,169
doesn't work very well doesn't make a
lot of sense

949
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:14,479
abut me go back and crypto as a musician

950
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,599
this early made sense to some people

951
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,389
but anyway you know it's it's something
we've repair work themselves out of

952
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:23,189
knowing that we can export thanks to
certain agree

953
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:25,219
certain few countries we can export to

954
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:27,339
at least we shouldn't

955
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:28,709
but uh...

956
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:31,609
but you know you know a asses get alone
it is really tough to try to convince

957
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:33,240
users destructive

958
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,690
is still trying to convince them that a
bare-bones

959
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,669
security installations going to do just
as good a job

960
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:39,810
is something that's

961
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,349
it's got uh... you know two armored
jackets on top of it

962
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:43,999
met with stop

963
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,839
armor piercing bullets and that's the
kind of security they walk

964
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:48,299
and i think they're not getting

965
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:52,319
you know from standard font the
best-equipped

966
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,849
everybody from n_s_a_

967
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:01,169
are with blueprint are for universal
group rhetorically we have to consider

968
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,130
in a simplistic

969
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,729
and security together

970
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:06,039
we have to consider privacy usability

971
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,559
you know we think of security sometimes
we think

972
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,739
you know this is meant to be complex
this is not meant to be interface with

973
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:14,219
well the truth is that isn't to be
replaced with

974
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:17,599
and the reason things go what the role
is not just because a completion falls

975
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,309
apart it's also because

976
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:21,919
the user doesn't have any instance judge
correctly

977
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:25,279
looks like a check marks here that
accidentally exports to secretly wish

978
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:27,809
they send out to the key server

979
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:30,630
for things like that our competence they
come into play

980
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,640
so that has to be

981
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,599
you know it is a problem

982
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,760
and some of you you notice but things
are becoming a lot more open-ended

983
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,339
it was great photography

984
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:42,050
woodland standards it's it's

985
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,700
it's based on standards best practices
really not quit

986
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,249
much the questioner

987
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:47,410
with blueprints archery

988
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,909
we're dealing with two fields apparently
come together so much a

989
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:55,539
a select few people working on and on
the carnegie mellon university cardinal

990
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:57,429
students eruptions

991
00:41:57,429 --> 00:42:00,529
anybody noticed that some cardinal

992
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:03,349
if we were with us i'll ahve

993
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:06,779
okay so so i went up in a little are
really cool stuff with usability of

994
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:07,919
privacy

995
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:11,139
but what's alarming about that is that
you have one university almost every

996
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:13,449
time you search for things in this
domain

997
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:16,829
it's bringing up carnegie mellon i'd
like to see some other people pitching

998
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:17,419
in

999
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:20,609
so that shows you how much in its
infancy it really is

1000
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:24,759
so in that sense is very open ended we
don't know a lot about renewed

1001
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:28,499
uh... alignments even uh... much more
problem because it deals with crypt are

1002
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:30,039
different communication

1003
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,269
you know we think of communication look
back to caution

1004
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:37,399
pioneers communication a lot of what he
says to extradite me

1005
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:40,579
preclude you know there's a revolution
we go to the back

1006
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:43,669
uh... but communications is really
involved in such a way especially with

1007
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:44,649
the internet

1008
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:47,579
that security has been built municipal
from

1009
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:48,779
from the very beginning

1010
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:50,460
here we have certain models are

1011
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,479
if you look at a locked room on security
protocols

1012
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:56,589
you know they're they're outdated
they're they're very old legacy

1013
00:42:56,589 --> 00:42:59,969
talked things would be too expensive
change but we didn't know better at the

1014
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:00,549
time

1015
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:03,539
so we need to look at you know what are
our limitations with cryptographic

1016
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,999
technique

1017
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,930
you know we're getting the most for
money

1018
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,619
you know what what can we do what you
know

1019
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,959
and this is even more open-ended details

1020
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:15,039
we're gonna reach a point where without
redesigning the internet

1021
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,119
we're gonna have

1022
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:18,099
you know capturing have a ceiling

1023
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,219
we're gonna have to look at ways to

1024
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:24,219
so to not be ideal but to be secure a
practice that's when things get tricky

1025
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,729
so expensive

1026
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:29,819
you know we lose our minds and trumpet
como adhoc waves to use standards

1027
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:33,809
worship at

1028
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:35,890
as a so on that looks at the
relationship

1029
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,169
between tartan medication

1030
00:43:38,169 --> 00:43:39,359
and we think of

1031
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,540
at the two together ought to think about
you know data information

1032
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,939
nausea winston

1033
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:46,409
and this is a here working it's uh...

1034
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:48,729
receives a lot of criticism because our

1035
00:43:48,729 --> 00:43:52,049
it's really hard to to look at and
determine what knowledge is what was the

1036
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:52,819
newspaper

1037
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:54,579
you differentiate between the two

1038
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:57,390
i'd like to try to do that today but
just to look at

1039
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,179
worker tartar free fits into that were
communication fits in it worked or if

1040
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:06,139
you fall short

1041
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:07,269
this market

1042
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,180
soaring data

1043
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,409
and we think of data as role symbols of
a super super fun

1044
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:12,999
but it works for this purpose

1045
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:14,430
solid withdrawal symbols

1046
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,090
a_b_c_ will sory

1047
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,000
question marks

1048
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,159
things that sort

1049
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,470
information we start lookin informatica

1050
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,349
the relationship

1051
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:24,139
between symbols and put them together

1052
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:25,190
if we can get married

1053
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,190
you know there's different letters
forget lol

1054
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,159
those numbers we need is a comfortable
there is a zipcar furrow

1055
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,549
that is what this mature about

1056
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:34,169
before

1057
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:35,869
parcel knowledge

1058
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:39,099
uh... again is very tough to find out
which

1059
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:42,339
we can say that it's useful information
you know when we find out what raleigh

1060
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:44,229
news and we can determine to city

1061
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:46,280
then it becomes useful rowlett myself

1062
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,770
not very useful doesn't work

1063
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,399
doesn't do much for being with us

1064
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:50,819
but if i don't stronger than i can

1065
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:52,130
family caroline

1066
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,359
it's pretty good things that i was on
the schedule

1067
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,759
booked up america

1068
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:00,399
vishwas out but

1069
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:02,379
so separation

1070
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:03,109
that uh...

1071
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:06,019
and wisdom wickets a wisdom is effective
knowledge

1072
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,730
and also one of the role as a city

1073
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,439
i can get out the matlab map quest i can
look at that

1074
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:13,859
the fastest way the best way to get to
raleigh and sure about time

1075
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:16,639
so i'm using this knowledge i'm
component knowledge

1076
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,019
in ways that it can be more effective
but just knowing you know rollins what

1077
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,419
rollins

1078
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:24,770
the system idea will relook at the
relationship

1079
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,459
between qatar communication

1080
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,629
from a court orders perspective

1081
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:34,439
resigning her cryptographic algorithm

1082
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:37,509
the data part will make sure that that
was unrecognizable from around

1083
00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:40,529
that's a very basic profit want to be
indistinguishable

1084
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,139
reynolds

1085
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,350
on the way we do this with the use of
the random

1086
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:47,900
uh... properties in arkansas perfect
which cryptography secures working for

1087
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,339
it

1088
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:50,459
thermostat down pat

1089
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,529
information wanna make sure they can
estimate the distribution of this

1090
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:56,559
we don't want them to find out what was
has more once zeros

1091
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,369
what does that mean you know can we

1092
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:00,089
what you learned from that

1093
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,559
now go into more mins ten minutes

1094
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,040
knowledge who will make sure they can't
recover the group

1095
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,659
the knowledge in the basement

1096
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:09,819
using the distribution of bits we would
make sure they don't deny me

1097
00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:13,569
in the effect of any useful information
from that

1098
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:15,889
honing in on the point

1099
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:19,529
wisdom will make sure the trip and most
of the attack in this case has no

1100
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:20,960
understanding of what they observe

1101
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,890
you know when we look at something that
uh... distribution of this

1102
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,319
we'll make sure looked around

1103
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,299
we don't see any patterns

1104
00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:30,739
uh... castro that the definitions cool
trick units were things fall apart

1105
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:31,650
unfortunate for

1106
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,209
for photography

1107
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,459
from a crip analyst himasa eckardt
analyst

1108
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:38,890
i_b_m_ something about the person
breaking the code

1109
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,179
but that's not really a malicious term

1110
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:45,829
uh... was like a charter for good guy
comes back

1111
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:48,839
better you know going back to back in
the business you know indistinguishable

1112
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,399
from random

1113
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:52,040
what is the fifth symbol in a message

1114
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,359
and please

1115
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,790
able to pick out and learn more
different bits or

1116
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,089
advances in the with format together

1117
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:00,639
you know they know what does that in a
remote place

1118
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:02,399
that's what we can look for their

1119
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,779
uh... information of a bit more once
zeros in this message

1120
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:07,879
as a reverse eclipse you know that sort

1121
00:47:07,879 --> 00:47:09,599
and other start to identify

1122
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,739
uh... relationships among samples and
that will pick out actual innum snippets

1123
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:15,220
of a binary integer

1124
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,669
that could lead to breaking

1125
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:19,999
eventually break in the planters for at
least reports the key

1126
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:21,919
different levels of the time

1127
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:24,439
tight knowledge

1128
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:26,409
traffic to be a

1129
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:28,659
kevin mccormally is also through now

1130
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:32,239
has the most of the workouts that sums
up to about one paper

1131
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:33,469
on a relationship

1132
00:47:33,469 --> 00:47:34,859
tartan communication

1133
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:38,329
or some other star they're working on a
tourist methods paper coming out looking

1134
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:40,419
at

1135
00:47:40,419 --> 00:47:42,170
think phonetic hacking of void

1136
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,119
encryption calls

1137
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,619
truck products more that later today

1138
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:47,149
uh... but with knowledge

1139
00:47:47,149 --> 00:47:49,369
you know if you look at information that
you're picking up

1140
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,719
institute

1141
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:53,140
different languages have different types
of distributions

1142
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,380
in a different languages have they use

1143
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,860
uh... one letter more than the other
investments that differentiates between

1144
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,499
english to french to german

1145
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:03,089
so if you can find out what language is
being spoken

1146
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,229
portuguese germany's what have you

1147
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:08,329
dinner on the simpson and lot of times
you can do this but looking at

1148
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:09,519
the distribution

1149
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:10,750
of lots of collude

1150
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,279
and you can look at you know

1151
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:14,549
how these compared to a different
languages

1152
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:17,279
you know were to work towards a tight
from there

1153
00:48:17,279 --> 00:48:18,219
uh... wisdom

1154
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:21,189
the dallas does ask bob a question or
difficult

1155
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,949
they were looking at the crips traffic

1156
00:48:23,949 --> 00:48:26,439
you know uh... we think about context

1157
00:48:26,439 --> 00:48:28,459
if i in last question

1158
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:31,329
and it may not always be apparent you
know what that questions about so the

1159
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:35,589
context of really important was the sort
of things that we can learn the context

1160
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:38,439
we can make use of the david hale

1161
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:40,569
and that's also were things that really
true

1162
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:43,839
perfect dark

1163
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,519
uh... it's a perfect this doesn't work
well for knowledge and wisdom level

1164
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,029
because information weeks because we
have contradiction resident

1165
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:52,859
things like metadata

1166
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,679
you know we can't

1167
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:57,360
it originally applied mathematical rooms
for that

1168
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,989
the way we do with it

1169
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:00,669
you know we can crypt metadata

1170
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:04,349
but we can always learn we can always
prevent adversary from learning context

1171
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:04,989
about

1172
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:08,339
the development software nor can we
learn more about the company behind the

1173
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:09,109
software what

1174
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:12,699
at track record and what types of
explicitly leave open we come back to

1175
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,749
look for

1176
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:18,459
this is not something for a party to
handle

1177
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:19,909
it is something that

1178
00:49:19,909 --> 00:49:21,759
is important communication

1179
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,129
of some quotes from kevin curly burke

1180
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,509
due to his take is all kirloskar t fail
to incorporate good models of

1181
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:29,689
communication

1182
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:32,680
we need better models of communication
over to the hospitality

1183
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,880
and we better death note

1184
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,839
definitions of knowledge and wisdom

1185
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,949
in order to that taught

1186
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:39,619
and now you're looking at

1187
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:44,129
fields demands likes philosophy you're
looking at things like always it was

1188
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:46,229
lurker parkers and developers

1189
00:49:46,229 --> 00:49:48,849
you know code monkeys don't sit around
and ponder

1190
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:53,219
the difference between knowledge it was
the maybe after a few cup so that butler

1191
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:54,300
imperil

1192
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,379
you know we don't worry about it it's
it's really

1193
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:58,689
really uh... very open and

1194
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:00,149
uh... discussion

1195
00:50:00,149 --> 00:50:02,119
about that's important we need to know

1196
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:03,759
uh... maybe liquor was worth it

1197
00:50:03,759 --> 00:50:05,499
what knowledge was more

1198
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:08,799
in this relationship in which a vast
field otherwise

1199
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:11,010
you know the court order to get stronger
but we're not

1200
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:14,499
what fixing those contextual residual
old learning about

1201
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:16,049
you know who's behind the curtain

1202
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:18,839
uh... into patterns things we can look
forward to

1203
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:25,119
related to curb talk that we can use
inside channels find a way

1204
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,049
and uh... you know in the paper

1205
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:28,309
communication frightening

1206
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:29,430
and that's what made by

1207
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,679
in context resident

1208
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,059
off-limits

1209
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:37,229
muscles tort law

1210
00:50:37,229 --> 00:50:40,039
less environment as well

1211
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:41,689
our target

1212
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:44,479
our top although speed to visit

1213
00:50:44,479 --> 00:50:48,400
european language broken into syllables
worms with communication paragraphs

1214
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,929

movies broken and friends internet
communication

1216
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:55,529
so everything we do in his first
indication

1217
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:57,629
his release segments frightening

1218
00:50:57,629 --> 00:50:59,869
and if i have some data here

1219
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:02,599
it may not mean much but if i could for
her at the context of our earlier

1220
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:05,929
conversations that may not be particular
things are packed earlier

1221
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:09,339
or you know we have a data processing
times that generates resident

1222
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:13,229
somewhere in separate file winslet's
work for you get my hands on that

1223
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:15,599
would come after that will come before

1224
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,970
ocular stuff leak information about the
better

1225
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:19,569
the at focus

1226
00:51:19,569 --> 00:51:21,789
an idea there

1227
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:27,409
we shouldn't just consider the focal the
stuff we want to crept that's not enough

1228
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:29,280
considered textile fragments

1229
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,209
like the meta data that gives a meeting

1230
00:51:32,209 --> 00:51:33,899
should consider resident

1231
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:37,029
a resident to be anything like it
separate file when you generate on who

1232
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:38,809
works with the like

1233
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:40,929
uh... typesetting software

1234
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:42,949
we'll take a look at

1235
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:45,469
and like with that

1236
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,579
head

1237
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:51,459
that's it

1238
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:55,979
latex but i i don't know

1239
00:51:55,979 --> 00:52:00,669
electric

1240
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:03,509
anyway without like taking a when you're
with the types of darkness could

1241
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:04,510
generate some

1242
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:07,289
swell residual files of some of the
types of information

1243
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:11,499
and loss of cases students and the
stuffs not always protected usually not

1244
00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:13,029
so we can learn information

1245
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,669
about the process given this residual
dead

1246
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:19,359
and we have to consider that and that's
not really easy

1247
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,620
given in a lack of attention is given to
the propellers and communication

1248
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:25,209
restore will have a good idea how to go
about it

1249
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:27,039
and what we're finding is that

1250
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:28,909
of the limitations of what we could do

1251
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:29,789
perfor

1252
00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:32,729
far less what we really hope

1253
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:34,649

dulce first version are

1257
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:41,450
agrees with university of washington
really

1258
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,169
well no researcher

1259
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:48,150
he was able to break winzip president
creek file names of the department of

1260
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,999
winzip houston krypton authenticate
composition that we use it back

1261
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:55,219
very secure in cycles the most secure
way you could do a correction

1262
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:56,409
authentication

1263
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:59,979
possibly using what we have today that's
what winzip use so that least understood

1264
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:01,409
that part

1265
00:53:01,409 --> 00:53:02,820
that is that understand that

1266
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,309
apparently that information to be leaked
from ed

1267
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:08,349
but i can look at following
automatically know exactly what type of

1268
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:11,269
information tonight finally an african
read

1269
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:13,919
so that's why that's important tulika

1270
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:16,040
at justice humans we have peripheral
vision

1271
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,469
uh... focused here but i can still see
out here

1272
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:21,380
you know that sets argument raspberry
important but it's a lot of bad things

1273
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,029
coming

1274
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:23,729
french peripheral vision

1275
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:25,920
so thick with security phase designers

1276
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,289
to use that same type of peripheral
vision

1277
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:34,879
when looking at that also consider you
know what's in around

1278
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:40,079
and obviously i want to be should be
considered

1279
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,839
close up here

1280
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,979
we'll have de let's talk about the
questions

1281
00:53:45,979 --> 00:53:49,019
terminus for questions

1282
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:54,339
toppled

1283
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:57,619
alright and what we felt was really
beautiful about mackerel

1284
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:00,689
you know we were doing something they
were packaging well-known stuff in

1285
00:54:00,689 --> 00:54:03,089
women's network more accessible

1286
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:06,419
but looking back at the shannon weaver
model of communication they laid out

1287
00:54:06,419 --> 00:54:09,369
three things technical semantic

1288
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:14,089
pakula communicate a message technical
problem but a lot perfectly with shirts

1289
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:18,209
have actively bizarre language convey
the maybe we want meeting of the smectic

1290
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:20,369
deals with accessibility

1291
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:23,639
in alignment obviously you know how
effective is that communication

1292
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:25,750
so what your findings things

1293
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:29,410
things are so intertwined that goes in a
back fifty sixty years to basic

1294
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,329
principles of coronal

1295
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:33,819
we just haven't learned how to put them
together and i think that's that was

1296
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:37,299
really the most crucial part of the
special project is the center on the

1297
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:39,309
right track or our fundamentals

1298
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,059
what they have been a long

1299
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:42,680
uh... we distant relies you know

1300
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,619
that we need to change quickly

1301
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:48,869
oh sensible before

1302
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,269
got a couple minutes this is a

1303
00:54:51,269 --> 00:54:54,849
select family tree some of you can
actually take them

1304
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:57,989
but if things that are recycled from the
pastor christian center and you might be

1305
00:54:57,989 --> 00:54:59,109
of the city

1306
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:01,419
uh... whirlpool ash function

1307
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:02,669
to fish

1308
00:55:02,669 --> 00:55:03,769
things like that

1309
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:05,150
is just to show how

1310
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:08,159
widely components have been in business
to cook standard

1311
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:09,189
are recycled

1312
00:55:09,189 --> 00:55:11,559
and what's really important that goes to
show that

1313
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,799
uh... for the naysayers of bay

1314
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:15,789
you know a lot of other

1315
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:17,170
and cryptographic primitives

1316
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:20,350
there's a lot of sewing techniques so
it's nothing for asthma thing that we

1317
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,589
should still be word about because it's
based on

1318
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:23,620
decades of

1319
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,259
of secure components

1320
00:55:25,259 --> 00:55:28,639
so i have is available to the homeless
get through

1321
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,180
this is the same type of thing for the
the shah three

1322
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,739
national chicken

1323
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:34,940
uh... the eighty s xbox

1324
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,729
the actually yes ma'am

1325
00:55:36,729 --> 00:55:39,670
as you get a a huge chunk of the hash
functions

1326
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,940
purple directly

1327
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,639
from business groups instead

1328
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:48,589
so that that this shows the confidence
that receptors and what

1329
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:52,589
skip these

1330
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:53,989
and the questions for them

1331
00:55:53,989 --> 00:56:00,989
one minute

1332
00:56:02,009 --> 00:56:04,859
like cc

1333
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:06,869
hotel suite of the mode of operation

1334
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:08,000
since then which is

1335
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,200
not package

1336
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,019
yet is

1337
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:13,699
and it's based on standards best
practice so special things according to

1338
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:19,209
the freemen royalties for the boys

1339
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,569
you know i don't know i think it's still
very early remained

1340
00:56:21,569 --> 00:56:25,279
because of how open ended the excess
built in the line factors or you know

1341
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:28,339
we're gonna have to reach out of these
apartments really proves that research

1342
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:31,169
first before we can really get attention

1343
00:56:31,169 --> 00:56:37,589
of groups government

1344
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:40,100
haven't yet we're just reduce tensions
researcher

1345
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,029
but that's something that we consider

1346
00:56:42,029 --> 00:56:49,029
where we can john about a letter and so
it's been a good ideas

1347
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:07,679
well well dilemmas that you know plus a
crippling decisions i don't want users

1348
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,059
to to try to debate between which is
most secure investor kirk just under two

1349
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:14,419
thirds serpent because our naka partners
and understand what goes into a

1350
00:57:14,419 --> 00:57:16,459
cryptographic around what makes a secure

1351
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:18,719
hadaka parent

1352
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,089
don't wisconsin server confidentiality
integrity we could find a better way to

1353
00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:23,279
communicate

1354
00:57:23,279 --> 00:57:26,209
exactly what the court order for his
doing without actually expect them to

1355
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:29,949
know the photography is or to understand
what you generation

1356
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:31,519
what prime numbers or

1357
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,809
uh... it is important is a failure or
partner communicate

1358
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:37,429
you know what's going on i just think
maybe works trying to communicate the

1359
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:38,489
wrong things

1360
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,559
basket lol stuff the benefits

1361
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,729
commences wonderful

1362
00:57:43,729 --> 00:57:50,729
any other questions

1363
00:58:00,399 --> 00:58:01,579
bicycles without

1364
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,339
and discussion

1365
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:08,199
actually arce comforts us were brunch
tomorrow are to be like that video

1366
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:11,549
he got too big a rematch with robert
vist audition or a lot of the crypt

1367
00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:15,029
harbours about what the court with
innocent does does not know

1368
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:18,499
he said that he believes that s i still
have the upper hand on certain types of

1369
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:20,359
research like nuclear

1370
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:23,409
an additional security command if it
sounds like that that that witness only

1371
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:26,349
concerned every person check agreement

1372
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:27,869
buddy fills it

1373
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:29,749
as far as photography goes

1374
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:33,700
we're pretty much uh... a december page
progressing very slowly because children

1375
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,599
short

1376
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:36,740
is that most of the big things as far as
the

1377
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,859
as he is aware

1378
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,869
and he was enormously for decades

1379
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:43,429
it says you know that uh... public
interest cold it was an answer

1380
00:58:43,429 --> 00:58:45,469
and as far as two to three years ahead

1381
00:58:45,469 --> 00:58:46,809
i guess i can see that

1382
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:49,059
block about two mathematicians in the
room

1383
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:51,609
and tell them to work on a project it's
easier for

1384
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:53,109
minnesota harness

1385
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:54,599
in the researchers at the marin

1386
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,049
arabic salaries and a solid

1387
00:58:56,049 --> 00:58:57,429
day-in and day out

1388
00:58:57,429 --> 00:59:00,839
whereas the public community were all
over the world so it's hard for us

1389
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:04,679
we can get together carcasses are sure
papers and research

1390
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:10,899
so that so yeah

1391
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:16,249
uh... i just loved it

1392
00:59:16,249 --> 00:59:19,829
that's it's a little racist

1393
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:24,469
alberta

1394
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:28,259
but is not configured for

1395
00:59:28,259 --> 00:59:34,519
uh... flow well i want to give up

1396
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:38,779
i have are europeans you bark
unnecessary and out of here to take this

1397
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:42,389
it's backpack ect upto

1398
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:49,389
that's accurate for

1399
00:59:55,999 --> 00:59:56,809
below it was a

1400
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:00,549
what was it a miracle

1401
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:01,969
other watch

1402
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:03,129
i'm not sure was

1403
01:00:03,129 --> 01:00:05,899
winner

1404
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:10,599
not so much so test made a mistake and i
think that was going i would like a

1405
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:14,139
rebel publication you know i clicked
format instead

1406
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:16,569
well-motivated dispose of the problems

1407
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:22,149
yep i would have a few cups that stuff

1408
01:00:22,149 --> 01:00:24,299
it one up here that is great

1409
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:28,969
out the contractor that's that is going
to cues

1410
01:00:28,969 --> 01:00:31,970
it it's like a when waterman breaks and
you

1411
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:38,489
sticker couple tapas or what let me tell
you i three glasses that's the time

1412
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:40,709
not yet

1413
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:42,709
hybrid racketeering

1414
01:00:42,709 --> 01:00:47,169
sellout

1415
01:00:47,169 --> 01:00:49,969
let's get just a hand it's really hard
to get last laugh
