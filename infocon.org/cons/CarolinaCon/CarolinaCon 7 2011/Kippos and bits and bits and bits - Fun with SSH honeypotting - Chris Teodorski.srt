1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,980
impressive republic

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,620
hi sign on and between everybody in
drinking their dinner so i promise i

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,510
will have

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,149
not go too long hair

5
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,479
all right well you're prepared

6
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:18,949
so my cock is called people in bits and
bits and dates

7
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,119
a little bit about me first uh... i'm a
battered husband

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,539
on the security analyst for p_b_g_c_
trees and allotted you probably have

9
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,509
never heard a peep begin mysteries

10
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,070
although you should have uh... because

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,650
we make the substance that makes the
cheese stick to the to reduce

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,399
so

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,130
or or a chemical company amongst other
things

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,760
that's one of our our claims the credit

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,860
without really pretty fast

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,280
and i believe it's silica based so i
don't know if you really should be

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,000
applauding

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,530
i'm uh... of full-time gig a member of
hack pittsburgh i wanna put a plug in

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,929
there for hackers bases all over the
country

20
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,200
if you're not a member of your hacker
space hackers facing me to be

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,780
every single time i visit by a hacker
space and learn something new

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,230
and that suggests you know support them
join them uh... you know speak at them

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,980
whatever they need help 'em out

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,590
uh... i am at ten oh beans at on uh...
twitter

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,390
and another plug here that i'm just
putting out there

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,270
uh... i have my own let's see p which is
the effects of security cert

27
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,480
professional

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,859
and i was slow starts and i could care
less about any of them

29
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,210
but this one i'm really proud of

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,920
this is the uh... sense of security the
folks make backtrack

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,590
uh... this is their class

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,200
and uh... yeah right there

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,700
and uh... it is absolutely hands down
the hardest and most rewarding

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,670
certification that i have

35
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,240
uh... it was it was the fits just it's
great i can't say enough about it and

36
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,250
it's cheap

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,940
so especially if you do it online to
check it out

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,310
highly recommended

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,290
about me

40
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,090
and let's move on

41
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,060
yes on campaigns

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,540
so my talk is on

43
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,279
honey potting

44
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:01,070
so let's start out by defining

45
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,260
what a honey pot is packs them in

46
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,220
interject here just for a second

47
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,490
i'm a big lemur fan

48
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,450
but apparently not big enough because i
didn't realize that rally has the

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,319
largest collection of lemurs outside of

50
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,519
of madagascar so uh... as soon as i
found that out uh... i've made my hip

51
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,389
there are whatever overall leader about
katie uh... so

52
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:26,249
um... yes so i think

53
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:29,529
i picked i think lemurs for this
presentation purely because i like

54
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:33,389
lemurs and and then was like below shit
now i know what i'm doing on monday

55
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,650
um... so i i i'm going to see the uh...
checkup lemurs

56
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,349
honey pot

57
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:40,860
i'm going to find a honey pot

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,250
as the security resource who values
allies in being probed attacked or

59
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,439
compromise

60
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,529
hopefully that sets it apart from your
other systems

61
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:55,209
and under that so there's two different
kinds of a funny part of a kind of loop

62
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,020
group in the two large categories

63
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,279
analysis

64
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,659
and delay

65
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,620
so analysis would be

66
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,650
for research

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,160
to research what the attackers are doing
take a look at com

68
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,010
how what kind of attacks they're doing
what kind of our they're dropping things

69
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,879
like that

70
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,069
uh... you prolly from a witch hunt
indeed honey that project

71
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,309
uh... i would classify that as a
research

72
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:16,469
uh... honey pot

73
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,859
then there's things like that but the
way like the will brea tar pit

74
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:20,880
uh... which

75
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,249
purpose is purely to delay

76
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:27,929
an attack so a scanner sweeps it and it
keeps that to those connections open for

77
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:29,180
a really long time

78
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,799
just to slow the attacker down i would
also categorize that as a honey pot

79
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,439
but again of the delay variety

80
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,869
so i'll talk a little bit about the rise
and fall and rise again and honey pot

81
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:42,850
and the reason i say this light was
originally the rise and fall

82
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,529
alice plain about that the second

83
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,680
but the first reference the first
written reference to honey pot

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,729
wasn't cliffs polls book the cuckoo's
egg

85
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:53,279
which if you haven't read it highly
recommend it

86
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:57,059
uh... he invented uh... the s_d_i_ net
project

87
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,109
uh... specifically to keep the hacker
interested so he could learn more

88
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:04,189
information about this particular packer

89
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:05,760
you worked out a berkeley lab's

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,219
it's a great repeats it's not it's not
overly technical

91
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,989
uh... but it's it's just kind of a
fascinating piece of

92
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,349
pieces at speeds of literature

93
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,750
what's really interesting for me was
uh...

94
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,829
and i i wonder how much it's really
change the heavy interface directly with

95
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,759
law enforcement in this case

96
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,539
uh... in my experience

97
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,539
but cliff really had a hard time

98
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:30,289
men again this this is stuff from it's
was written in oblivious publish an

99
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,430
eighty nine

100
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,629
uh... and his work was before that

101
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,580
law enforcement is wasn't interested

102
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,459
uh... he tried to get them interested
but they're just

103
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,099
there just wasn't much interest

104
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:45,050
and uh... what he was doing

105
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,520
indeed early to thousands the concept of
honey pots was really hot

106
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
if you uh... check out the internet

107
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,580
and you look back from if you google for

108
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,430
honey pot

109
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,480
you'll find tons of information all of
it from ten years ago it was it was

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,000
really caught uh...

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,679
everybody was selling one

112
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,130
uh... semantic was selling man trapped

113
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,629
uh... their respect their netdate p f k
f sensor

114
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,290
they're all kinds of honey pots out
there

115
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,419
it was really if you read everybody was
really excited about honey pots

116
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,539
kinda nothin just kind of

117
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:19,229
at that point

118
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:20,860
now when i was doing

119
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,710
uh... i ran across the patriot box i saw
this website i was really excited

120
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,979
and i was like arm and this is great
this there's an active honey pot into

121
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,529
windows honey pot

122
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,419
and i started reading it's like a that's
only thirty nine ninety nine

123
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,370
and then it said you know it's a clara
guises anat as an idea s honey pot which

124
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,289
i i i can kind of see why you would
characterize a honey part of the ninety

125
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:41,159
s but

126
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,310
uh... the more i started reading reading
about it

127
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,050
the more i thought it was probably
something from this guy

128
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,229
vows

129
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,249
now dot no offense to anyone if they
happen to work on the air

130
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:54,759
the uh... patriot box project

131
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,650
yet it just started to look like
something right

132
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,620
uh... so you're probably wondering uh...
why is this lemur making out with john

133
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,780
cleese

134
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,830
and twelve alright and uh... or you're
wondering what happened to honey pots

135
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,299
why did they go away

136
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:11,010
i kinda oppose the question to twitter
when i first

137
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,639
kind of conceptualize this in

138
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,330
asks the the twitter burst

139
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,849
why no honey pots

140
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:17,309
and uh...

141
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,419
i got one really good response

142
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,529
and it was from the carver who is a
uh... malware analysts from uh... mandy

143
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:26,750
and i think is the name of the company

144
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,720
he responded to this is his quote

145
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,469
maybe because it's a waste of time and
never improve security

146
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:33,240
uh...

147
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,020
and i was like uh... well that kinda
hurts my heart uh...

148
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,909
but ok so maybe that's true

149
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,680
but i think probably

150
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,239
the honey pot died

151
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:45,919
because it's died in the sense that
commercial vendors lost interest in it

152
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,449
let me lee put that

153
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,839
that's ready by god

154
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,710
because it's hard

155
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,589
to get information out of

156
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:56,709
i don't think it's kind of the click
click drawl product that you can put out

157
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,550
their and get all kinds of amazing
analysis

158
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,419
and i think that's probably why it was
light was a little bit more of a tough

159
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:03,699
sell

160
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,279
now i say that

161
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,610
and as you see this

162
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,129
this day in public and see if there is a
published seventeen april two thousand

163
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,319
eleven

164
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,509
uh... so right as i was getting ready in
finalizing my presentation

165
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,029
i discovered that symantec

166
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,559
is now selling honey pots again

167
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:24,019
um... they just announced that they are
selling now this is to select

168
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,279
individuals

169
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:31,119
uh... they say u_s_ government agencies
nato and major corporations

170
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,180
they uh... they've always hear them our
vendors have always

171
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,029
maintained honey pots to collect

172
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:37,129
to collect malware

173
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,510
um... and apparently according to the
article

174
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,989
uh... the other uh... vendors were quite
shocked by symantec surrounds me

175
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:46,949
to to start selling this product again
so that's why i said the rise and fall

176
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,330
and rise again

177
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,559
because i have a believe have to believe
that semantics doing it

178
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,159
the other companies are going to start
doing it again as well

179
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,439
and not sure how far that's going to go

180
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,779
uh... micah said semantics very

181
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:05,779
have very narrowly limited who they're
going to be selling it to supposedly

182
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,520
uh... act this is how i feel about honey
pots

183
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,219
um... lenny's ulcer summed it up here
and as you get your own very capable of

184
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:13,899
reading

185
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,740
uh... but i think what's really
interesting is he talks about the nature

186
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,220
and a prize

187
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,210
and i think that's

188
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,099
that is probably the key

189
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:24,690
a honey pocha absolutley not be the
first piece of

190
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,459
technology deploy

191
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,240
in your organization but i think there
is value in a mature

192
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,979
amateur organization like he says you
know you you don't get a ton of false

193
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,659
positives off of the honey pot

194
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,420
because i a delia honey pot shouldn't
see any traffic

195
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,430
other band

196
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,840
malicious traffic

197
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,670
uh... because again it has no production
value

198
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,270
uh... again in our samples and it give
you an idea into the intruders

199
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,760
intentions

200
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,629
by uh...

201
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,470
don't want to say that you know

202
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,540
the honey pot as a panacea like i said i
think it's for mature

203
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,670
amateur enterprise could consider it

204
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,080
uh...

205
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,990
there are real issues

206
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,989
deploying honey pot in an organization

207
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:06,320
and i say that because

208
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,899
for example i don't think i would want
to fight

209
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,520
would tell you we don't buy can't
convince my boss to run honey pot

210
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,439
if i could

211
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:16,679
i don't think if we had to have a q
essay come in and i had to explain to

212
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,480
him

213
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,520
what this honey pot was that that would
necessarily fly oh flight very well

214
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,690
again because this is an intentionally
in this team in the cases that are

215
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,260
looking at this is an intentionally
political system

216
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,600
uh... and that would be at a tough sell

217
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,330
to anyone

218
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,420
you know so for compliance requirements
again

219
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,540
there may be reasons why hunny part just
wouldn't work in an organization

220
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,460
but for me

221
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,390
it's a really fun friday night

222
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,390
um...

223
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,960
i had a great time doing that stuff

224
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,170
so i'm gonna talk about thibault first

225
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,320
and uh... thibault is a medium
interaction assistant honey pot

226
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,360
and what i wanted to define the
differences somewhat a

227
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,390
medium

228
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,130
low

229
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,300
high interaction

230
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,920
honey pots

231
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,700
hello interaction honey pot is strictly
honey pot that mimics

232
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,680
network service

233
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,410
but that's as far as it goes it appears
to be a network service

234
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,329
period don

235
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,900
you poke it it says on the network
service dot

236
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,840
medium interaction

237
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,110
get getting a little bit more
interactive

238
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,219
it mimics an operating system so that
you can see

239
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:19,620
you can have a little fuller experience

240
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,800
and then when you get to a high
interaction honey pot

241
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,199
that is a system that actually appears
to be the entire ls

242
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,890
or is afford one operating system

243
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,270
uh... thibault

244
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,070
is a breeze to install

245
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,340
uh... is the requirements for cabo

246
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,780
arcipello is an s_o_s_ h

247
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,740
um...

248
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,409
it's peace cake to install

249
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,630
as a matter of fact

250
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,890
uh... this that line right there will
get you

251
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,590
uh... up and running

252
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,579
on ubuntu

253
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,100
which is where i bring korbo

254
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,000
down the triple extracting go

255
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,010
you do have to tweak if you want to
tweak

256
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,880
you don't have to you

257
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,040
you want to tweak

258
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,340
the uh...

259
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,800
the korbo config file

260
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,200
uh... you can by default it sets the
stage for at least two two two two

261
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,559
uh... you can change the hostname and

262
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,900
what it does is it important to repel

263
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,840
and again this is it's all mimicking
s_s_-eighteen's not really s_s_ h

264
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,649
uh... it creates a recount

265
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:16,820
with a password

266
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,339
that is configurable in there

267
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,670
and it supposed to be easy password
because this is to attack attract brute

268
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,820
force attacks

269
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,390
they should be obvious

270
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,260
you would really have to work to do this
because people checks to make sure

271
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,989
you're not running his route

272
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:32,680
but don't run the system

273
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,220
uh... because this if this is running on
an operating system that you don't want

274
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,200
to get home

275
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,350
you probably don't want to run could
pose a risk

276
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,200
but he said you have to work at it if
you try to run his route

277
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,780
people complains and says hey you're
being dot

278
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,510
just wanna put that out there

279
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,100
the other thing you might want to do is
again you're running is on privileged

280
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,260
user so what i did was i use this i_p_
tables command

281
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,500
to simply redirect

282
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,130
uh...

283
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,920
my any incoming traffic on twenty two
two four two two two two

284
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,790
which is where cat though is actually
running

285
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,639
so what you said

286
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,439
set that up

287
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:08,760
you sit back and wait

288
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,389
now what i did was iran

289
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:12,970
kibble on

290
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,300
ought to

291
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,180
disparity

292
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,490
systems iran to vp s is

293
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,209
on two different companies hosted in two
different locations

294
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:23,250
just to kind of see what kind of
information i collect u_p_s_'s are so

295
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,580
cheap nowadays

296
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,000
that uh... it just

297
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,430
it was just i just wanted to see if i
saw anything different between the two

298
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,830
and when you're looking cat though

299
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,000
these are the directories you're
interested in

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,340
the deal directory

301
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,959
uh... will contain all of the malware

302
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,430
that the people who connected

303
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,110
to your machine try to upload so you'll
see that in the d l directory

304
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,290
the log directory

305
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,329
will contain all along to all of the
brute force attempts and where they

306
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:51,870
originated from

307
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,389
and the t t y directory

308
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:57,370
the neat thing about cabo is that it
enables v_c_r_ like playback

309
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,240
of what the attacker data not demo that
a second

310
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,720
uh... and that is contained in that city
wide directory

311
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,360
that is alive demagogue

312
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,590
because

313
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:13,590
you need to worship and doesn't know
this is an

314
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,910
the case and i want to show you the
reason actual session

315
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,660
it was captured on one of my

316
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,710
uh... honey pots

317
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,820
so this is an actual attacker
interacting with my honey pot

318
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,240
now again if this is all riding in
thibault

319
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,280
so it may mixes the operating system but
it isn't a full-blown

320
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,850
uh... implementation of the u_s_
obviously

321
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:55,850
aliyah

322
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,150
uh...

323
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,810
hopefully this

324
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,640
okay so i mean the s_s_ l webserver
again this is the actual attacker

325
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,870
attacking

326
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,850
isn't he ap

327
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,690
clears the history

328
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,910
and this is what i think it's so
marvelous about hippos that you get this

329
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,160
he's gonna take a look to see

330
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,040
uh... what kind of environment is
working in

331
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,350
can reset the uh...

332
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,580
the repair effort

333
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,290
uh... i don't know what he tried to set
it to

334
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,390
um...

335
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,850
i know what it was it was one two three
four five six

336
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,700
and uh... he change into something else

337
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:02,700
so he's going to go ahead and download
his na work it here

338
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,150
it absolutely is running it's actually
fetching what he

339
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,820
what he wants i don't think it runs
actually runs w get

340
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:22,820
i think it does the h_t_t_p_ port what
he wants the thing

341
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,580
so and the best thing yes

342
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,530
what you're actually seeing is his
program is blowing up

343
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,340
because he's trying to run in this
emulated s_s_-eighteen virumail

344
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,850
and now he's kinda get annoyed because
you can't figure out why his crap isn't

345
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:45,850
working

346
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,570
and then who uh... coming up here's also
my favorite parts about uh...

347
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:58,570
so again he's just try to figure out why
his flights all my life and his work

348
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,550
yeah i mean he is his

349
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,130
daddy's check in on the uh...

350
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:14,300
colonel version

351
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,240
and then the exits but this is the best
thing about give us give us a little

352
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,910
exit

353
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,860
it drops it to another party

354
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,210
so

355
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,470
so he's got a little confused here at
this point he's trying to run some more

356
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,710
calls

357
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,040
and then he'll do that you know he he's

358
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,830
what the hell's going on here

359
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,430
huh

360
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,710
so i think i think honestly at this
point he doesn't know which prompt is

361
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,470
that on this is what i think

362
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,190
benny exits again

363
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,710
he's still at it

364
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:56,040
um...

365
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,779
uh...

366
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,650
so and i think at this point he gets
marked and and on address the exit again

367
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,579
and then it's at this point where he
gets i think he gets pissed at lease

368
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:14,130
no

369
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,049
uh...

370
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,640
preferring

371
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,640
alright so thats

372
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,560
right right

373
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,920
so what i thought i learned and despite
that lasts at last our presentation

374
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,230
they're the enemy was smarter than i
thought

375
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,210
and the reason i say that is because
after watching a bunch of them

376
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,120
um...

377
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,210
thibault doesn't do its not it's not a
real

378
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,070
uh... implementation so there were
things that they were they obviously

379
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,520
have learned to check for to see if it's
a honey pot

380
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,290
silly things i mean silly things that
the kid but doesn't like

381
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,720
yet it has replied

382
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
is blank in incapable

383
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,390
so i started learning and kind of making
myself look more real

384
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,590
because i was watching what they were
doing you can pull things into the

385
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,400
filesystem for cabo so i started making
things look real and i say i i thought

386
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,120
they were chinese and i put that in
there because a lot of the eyepiece and

387
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,520
not know all of them i didn't check out
all of them

388
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,539
but a lot of yet he's recovering from
china

389
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,130
and i kinda thought that was boring
souls like uh... well yeah that's what i

390
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,280
expected

391
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,549
the next thing is i said well gee you
skip it was fun

392
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:28,360
should i really stop there

393
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,950
so i really just stop because again they
couldn't do what they wanted to do

394
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,030
so i have a really good friend who's an
attorney back home

395
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,380
who said that i really needed to put
this disclaimer in

396
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,320
my machine

397
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,610
but i'm gonna show you was actively used
in attacks against other people

398
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,620
so if you do what i did

399
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,950
your machine could get used in attacks
against other people

400
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,200
that might anju earn you a pair of these

401
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,880
if it earns you pair of these in my dad
used to release some of this

402
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,600
but most likely

403
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,760
out that the series was phenomenal

404
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,799
uh... what

405
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,429
more than likely it's gonna

406
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:10,330
ernie this which is no internet because
you violated your terms of service

407
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,440
so this is what i set up

408
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,990
over on the left

409
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,790
is where i set up my honey pot network

410
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,310
over on the right is where i keep my
point

411
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,429
um...

412
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,500
or my hope the rest of my home network

413
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,880
um... sp

414
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,029
etc dot that's the important stuff right

415
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:32,350
no that's all that's important over
there

416
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,590
what i set up here was other stuff on
the left

417
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,530
is a yes x server

418
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,350
running four hosts

419
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,210
uh... one of the hostess p_f_ sense
which if you haven't checked out psns is

420
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,100
an amazing final product

421
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,730
uh... alex client and all explain why
the one x client a second

422
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,970
smartbox analytics box for the horrible
root password

423
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,020
again one two three four five six

424
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,110
uh... because they seem to get that
relatively quickly

425
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,400
for obvious reasons uh...

426
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,580
what i did was on the lyricsbox ideas
non persistent desk

427
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,399
so that they could get in there

428
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,330
do whatever they wanted i could rebooted
cold start it boom they're gone and i

429
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,720
start fresh

430
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,810
uh... so that's

431
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,809
that's what what was the situation there

432
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,360
iran snort

433
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,390
purely because i was just curious to see
what if they would want to any other

434
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,279
kind of attacks per se

435
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,429
from my box once they had rooted

436
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:31,260
and the other box the one x client box
that i said i would explain

437
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,679
this segment of the network was
completely isolated from my

438
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,489
uh... and again i was using non
persistent desk

439
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:41,759
so anything i captured interesting on
the box ticket rebooted whose proof was

440
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,410
gone

441
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,860
so i had to of way to move things
in-and-out so that links client boxes

442
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,470
there high-power mup

443
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,500
moot use him as a middle point he was
allowed to bridge the two networks not

444
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,720
shut down

445
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
and uh...

446
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,929
that that was what that machine the
purpose of that machine

447
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:58,169
uh... so what i did

448
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,170
for my honey pot

449
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,080
was our use dot pseudo s_h_

450
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,200
uh... mass fit

451
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,429
that's in quotes because height purely
created a link

452
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:09,390
and called it k s age

453
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,860
um...

454
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,880
and that's

455
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,720
we still use korn shell at work which
makes me with sap uh...

456
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,550
and so that's why i put that in their
uh...

457
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,890
i didn't try very hard to be secretive
and i used to have to ask the sage

458
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,580
binary now what i did was five

459
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,999
i wanted to be able to capture username
and password and i p address

460
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:29,150
from the attackers

461
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,990
but i wanted to run real s_s_ age

462
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,240
so i changed off password

463
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,300
in s s h recompile det

464
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,140
and this is

465
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,999
my code

466
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,950
it's available here again if anybody
wants to play with it

467
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,500
i'm not a c programmer by any stretch of
the imagination so i'm sure it could be

468
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,190
done more elegantly more cleanly but it
works

469
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,040
uh... and it's available there

470
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,210
with the cabbie dot

471
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,610
don't use this into production violent
if you do you're dumb

472
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:59,549
because it will capture using a password
in clear text

473
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:01,330
uh... this is what the output looks like

474
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,860
it gives you time stamp

475
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,169
uh... the account password and happy
that they're coming from

476
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:07,390
just to give you an idea

477
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,380
uh... i really was curious to catch that

478
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,850
because people gives you that and i want
to see if i saw anything different

479
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,520
so then i wait

480
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,130
the boxes owned over and over and over
again

481
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,820
the one thing i discovered was that was
almost always the same our

482
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,230
uh... there really wasn't much variation

483
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,360
it was almost always in the same places

484
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,470
they were very creative about where they
came

485
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,240
there

486
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,409
and this time

487
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:38,580
unlike what identical because again
remember i was running cubao on a vp s

488
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,799
out on the internet

489
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,840
uh... i have a little more information

490
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,140
and most of that information yet

491
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,690
what we'll get to that will that's
coming up

492
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,909
uh...

493
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:54,830
that's coming up

494
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,070
so um...

495
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,130
but this time i had a little more
information had some more details

496
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,070
because

497
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,840
what i had was

498
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,190
my psns box sitting there collecting all
the traffic collecting everything

499
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,650
now i was gonna do assiduous h live demo

500
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,100
because of time i think i'm just gonna
skip it if we want to see it again

501
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,559
citrus h allows that

502
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,620
uh... bcr lick playback as well so you
can replay everything if you're going to

503
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,079
see exactly what you see

504
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,440
we saw on korbo

505
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,299
um...

506
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:32,110
and it runs about three minutes long so
i i think i'm gonna skip

507
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,770
i want to talk about

508
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,210
what i found there

509
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,669
most always they were using ir seem ek
baat

510
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,600
uh... for command control

511
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,490
um... these peace camp

512
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,690
primarily for brute forcing

513
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,350
uh... it was almost always a denial of
service tool dropped it was different

514
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,870
tools but it was almost always there

515
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,100
and it was a user and password list

516
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,230
now the interesting thing about the user
password list

517
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,200
was i collected several of them

518
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,150
and i went to the largest

519
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,570
one that they had dropped the largest
collection of users and passwords they

520
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,620
dropped

521
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,279
and

522
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,029
they will total of two hundred and
thirty three thousand combinations

523
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:11,660
user passwords

524
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,260
i was like wow that's a lot

525
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,760
and the unique that

526
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,549
there was only a hundred and forty-eight
thousand uniques

527
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:22,159
so they were doing a whole lot of
redundant work there

528
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,400
again may

529
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,560
talk about what you guys were suggesting
about the skill level of these packers

530
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,009
uh... so this is an example of what i
was able

531
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,380
to pull off of

532
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,660
the uh... the psns box because again it
could just do we just sitting there

533
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,260
capturing all the track

534
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,210
now this is that attempting to run

535
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,890
uh... an s_s_ h

536
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,300
uh... brute force against you know
someone else they're just probing for us

537
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,460
to say to this point

538
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,580
because i knew that s_ s_ h_ was
involved

539
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,529
and i knew

540
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:52,759
that aghast

541
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,080
recruit this way i guess

542
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,419
that's pam was involved

543
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:01,480
i blocked at my psns any outbound s_s_
age and any outbound acidity

544
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,230
so what you're seeing here is it

545
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:09,140
their attacks are there as a six games
are just being black holes

546
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,539
what i was able to capture

547
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:15,370
and then this is my machine actually
being used in a denial of service attack

548
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,080
against another host

549
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,540
and that this was something i hadn't
necessarily anticipated

550
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,769
and so i'd wasn't filtering this traffic
so this again

551
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:30,269
you know my machine was used in an
attack against someone

552
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,390
uh... i'll get into that a second

553
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,510
so i don't give away the punch line just
yet

554
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,510
so

555
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,630
what i did was i started going for all
the traffic i had tons of traffic

556
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,890
that i had captured um... and again i
started looking for you know interesting

557
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,810
cortex protocols knew they were using
our seats i started looking at what

558
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,690
they were doing on our c

559
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,600
uh...

560
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,570
and

561
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,190
you know again going through that

562
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,310
looking at more i received a notice that
my machine

563
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,390
connected to

564
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,480
uh... machine perry today

565
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,930
uh... channel ir c

566
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,240
piccolo p_i_ c_e_o_ l_l_ uh...

567
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,160
um...

568
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,440
and i decided that

569
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,039
i wanted to join the channel

570
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,880
and and chat with those people

571
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,980
um... so what i did was i created
originally thinly-veiled excuse for why

572
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
i was there

573
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,270
uh... this is a dragon ball z character
whose name is take a while

574
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,330
which is very close to piccolo

575
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,210
so what they did was and again i was not
really try this was not any real clever

576
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,270
social engineering attack i just wanted
a little explanation as to why i was

577
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,710
there

578
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,340
i uh... joins their channel and said
that i was a really big fan of

579
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,950
dragonball z

580
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,429
and was like hey what do you think about
dragonball z

581
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:42,240
um... and so this list

582
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,649
this was my identity i would say i was a
sixteen-year-old kid right that's what i

583
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:46,260
said

584
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,820
and because i knew my act he was going
to track back to my might

585
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,149
you know to generally my area i was
honest about where i was from i said you

586
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:53,590
know

587
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:58,409
on the sixteen-year-old from pittsburgh
is really interested in dragonball z

588
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:03,750
and i was determined that we were gonna
become just the bestest friends

589
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,770
so this is an example of what i was
first greeted with when i joined

590
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,720
tran

591
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,600
uh... as you can see i've change these
names and all explain in a minute why

592
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,320
have changed the nicknames

593
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,600
as you can see this is the out since
i'll be

594
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,799
is featuring a command to the box

595
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,510
and they're all checking it so he's
saying say a and they're all checking

596
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,650
that there was a lot of that could
change

597
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,350
then i joined the che on the my nickname
israel on here i_d_'s father being

598
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,780
canopies father being

599
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,070
there's a connection there so i was
probably

600
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,650
i'd join and as you can see he issued
the command to me

601
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,510
and

602
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,870
i'd just imitate it breaks a day

603
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,740
and then i would welcome a doesn't work
for me

604
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,910
and then i start my host feel about it a
big dragon ball z fan

605
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,480
and we had this conversation about hold
we are

606
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,399
and uh... again remember im going into
this expecting that i'm

607
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:56,909
dealing probably with folks from china

608
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,490
and by asking about you know he says
he's twenty four and i said you're not

609
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,159
too old for dragonball hall

610
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,050
and he smiles and said i've seen
cartoons once

611
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,580
and i said i thought this was a channel
for dragonball

612
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,669
well he says he's from europa

613
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:15,120
uh... which i thought was again at

614
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,889
was like global that's not what i
expected

615
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:21,289
uh... and then i realized that i was in
dealing with the p_t_l_ is dealing with

616
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,280
the party thi

617
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,559
or romanian persistent threat

618
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,679
i started looking through the logs of
the languages that was were being spoken

619
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,840
in trying to translate them into a
translating it was all romanian a

620
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,990
hundred percent

621
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,540
these folks were all speaking romanian
to each other

622
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,360
um...

623
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,760
so i started playing on that a little

624
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,279
and i'd drop the whole dragonball z
thing that was done because i knew that

625
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,130
that was

626
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,100
not only was it and probably not
necessary because no one was questioning

627
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,230
it

628
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,600
i knew that they were obviously
unfamiliar with that

629
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,950
uh... so

630
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,740
i started asking them lots of questions
about romania completely played into the

631
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,110
house allowing only thing about romania

632
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,320
again and playing the role of a of a
uh...

633
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,230
thirteen-year or sixteen-year-old kid

634
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,889
you know i'm i was reading on wikipedia
bout romania

635
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:06,820
and they were really really happy

636
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,380
to tell me all about romania and brag
about how possible mania was

637
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,380
and so we started again having more
conversations about another channel for

638
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,389
quite a while

639
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,460
and i started asking him questions
because again the issuing commands to

640
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,000
their box in the channel right in the
clear right in the channel

641
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,600
so i started asking about what they were
doing

642
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,270
and uh...

643
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,740
you know i ask what because they should
come and you know bang s_ s_ h_ and then

644
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,589
and i p

645
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,380
and the pork and i said what to do

646
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,580
and they said uh... you know it pains le
server

647
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,090
uh... and i said well he's doing it's
multiple servers

648
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,020
and then he disappears

649
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,470
and i said tell me i want to know i
wanna learn so that was the new taxes i

650
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,809
started saying jeez what you guys are
doing to really cool i wanna learn about

651
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:54,919
and uh... again here's where art little
conversation about

652
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,980
about romania and this conversation
really struck me

653
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,060
because i'm he's explaining that he's
romanian

654
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,669
and i'm like while remaining was a
kingdom

655
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:07,330
who cares and uh... but i'm really
playing into this idea that i think your

656
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,600
country's awesome in part on a plane to
that you know a little bit

657
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,970
and i asked him i said how old are you
and i think it's a twenty three nice to

658
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,679
be working out of school and he said i'm
stealing other countries

659
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,930
he was buried

660
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,790
he was very uh... very open about it and
stealing another country in the i said

661
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,580
what lisa to survive

662
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,880
and i said i don't understand and he
said to survive of i steal

663
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,299
there is honor among speeds

664
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,309
um...

665
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:37,680
again these names have been changed

666
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,980
uh...

667
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,100
hi was

668
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,740
transcript a high winds

669
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,659
i was inlet the channel

670
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:47,730
and us someone came on the channel and
said

671
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,830
uh... was bragging about all of the
routes that they had that was what that

672
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,639
was with the term they would use roots

673
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:55,649
you know bla bla bla routes that was
that seem to be that the lingo that they

674
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,909
were that they were thrown back and
forth

675
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:01,149
and one of the really frustrating things
worse

676
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:03,320
i'm assuming that a lot of the language

677
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,000
and again uh... you know if you did the
same in english piracy is well

678
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,690
uh... a lot of it was slang

679
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,399
so i'm sitting there with the bugle
translate up and that thing to try to

680
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,229
copy paste as quick as i can

681
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:18,430
to capture what they're saying a lot of
it wouldn't translate

682
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,690
someone started when i i was saying i
really want to learn i really wanna

683
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,030
learn t tell me more about this

684
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,430
uh... someone said to me lot also you
will root for a dollar

685
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,080
now again remember i'm on this this
facade that i a m this sixteen you're

686
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,990
okay

687
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,809
and i said okay i'm gonna get my mom's
pay pal account

688
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:37,360
how do i get your dollar

689
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,030
i-seventy democratic cardinal all pay
you a dollar

690
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,620
and again on plans to do i need to use
romanian pay pal like i don't i don't

691
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,279
know exactly what i need to do here

692
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,380
and all the sudden

693
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,199
my friend req

694
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,450
rock around the block

695
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,490
comes in

696
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,879
and private message three and says

697
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,110
man stay chill

698
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,780
don't buy routes like a taller

699
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,159
they're not roots

700
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,360
and again i'm playing on the line and
understand we're talking about

701
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,059
he says he send you money who give you
nothing aural give you root next a dot

702
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,270
habit

703
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,330
and so i said well how much of a route
cost

704
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,220
right idon't know and he says ten to
twenty

705
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,720
dollars or uros

706
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,659
four he'd he actually said euros

707
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:17,200
uh... ten to twenty euros for a good
roots what he defined as a good

708
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,559
uh... he kept stressing to me that one
dollar routes are

709
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,910
in his words

710
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,760
um...

711
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,170
so

712
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,300
abril luca became my friend

713
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,309
the reason i changed the names in the
presentation

714
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:34,059
is because i'm assuming this
presentation is gonna get posted

715
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,980
somewhere

716
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,769
i don't know who i'm actually dealing
with here

717
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:42,159
uh... to your question of who are these
people like what are they what are they

718
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,980
working for the following a script for
all i know this is russian mob and the

719
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,029
last thing i want

720
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:48,429
is this guy to disappear

721
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:50,300
because he was blabbing to me

722
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,909
about what they were doing

723
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:54,519
uh... so and and so everyone's

724
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:58,720
uh... i have seen it's a completely made
up here

725
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,980
those are the addresses a real i didn't
james

726
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,440
right and that that's a big i had no
idea who they were

727
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,240
he was very talkative to me

728
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,269
and uh...

729
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:16,500
again tonight by i asked him you know
it's a really bad idea to use my mom's

730
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,870
pay pal

731
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,770
and he says that you know after

732
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,780
lead which is the best thing about this
guy really was just trying to help me

733
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,460
out

734
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,360
he explains to me that he scans uh...

735
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,629
you know if you'll stand fall most force
that thirty five hundred like these at a

736
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:30,640
time

737
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,570
and up from there he gets about ten to
twenty roots which says how bad the

738
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,620
passwords have to be on a lot of these
hosts

739
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,370
and he says you know that's two hundred
aerospace so that's a lot of money

740
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,210
now the other thing about my friend rel
got is spot he told me that he was

741
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,340
sixteen years old

742
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,220
um...

743
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,509
and he sixteen years old i can't verify
have this in the future slide

744
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:53,159
he sixteen years old

745
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,640
and he explains to me that idea that
that two hundred dollars is on you have

746
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,139
to endure owes a lot of money

747
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:01,369
now i had no idea with the economy in
romania as i know when i was sixteen if

748
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:03,330
i was born in two hundred dollars a week

749
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,399
i can only imagine what kind of nonsense
i would get into

750
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,210
uh...

751
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,659
but he even goes as far as to tell me
what alan he's from

752
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,869
and the streets

753
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:16,099
so that's what my friend uh...
relentless

754
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,599
um... it seems to be a nice uh... you
know coastal town in romania

755
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,939
uh... and uh... you happy he let me know
the street where he would

756
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,379
i took this guy at his word because

757
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:32,169
he jumped in to save me so i think this
guy really was

758
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:37,419
just he just wanted to check he was just
tell me what was going on

759
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:39,799
the other thing is

760
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:43,619
uh... i i tell him again i really wanna
learn how to do this and he said well

761
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,450
you need to route to do that so

762
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,329
you know they were smart enough never to
attack from

763
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:51,789
their own machine they were always
getting on one machine and and jumping

764
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,409
from that machine

765
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,839
uh...

766
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,829
he explains the whole group asks

767
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:00,489
the brute force thing it's you know one
thousand two thousand passwords that

768
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,000
matches bingo i got route

769
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,369
and twenty dollars

770
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:06,359
and i asked if he ever got trouble and
he said no

771
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:10,749
i'm not eighteen years old and he said
in romania to go to prison for this

772
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:13,389
but they don't do it for anyone under
eighteen

773
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:16,359
and i asked him i said that you guys
have julian he had no idea what i was

774
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:17,420
talking about ice

775
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,650
started saying well it's prison for kids

776
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,959
and i thought i'd i'd just doesn't sound
good

777
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:28,269
so we can change the subject and uh...
but he did it restrictions that have

778
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:32,809
come to america where prison for
children

779
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:34,009
and so

780
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:38,129
uh... yet so he said you know he he
could be in he

781
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:39,149
it

782
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:40,790
they could be imprisoned for this

783
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,649
uh... and so i kept asking him you know
what do you guys do with all these

784
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:48,220
and he said you know we stand for other
routes we flood we stamp

785
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,469
we make money

786
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:50,990
so the question i kept asking was

787
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,619
who do you sell these two who's buying
these

788
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,369
he's getting a twenty year olds

789
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:58,470
eighties gate would be he's getting
twenty euros any

790
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,569
he's only answer me was hahaha people
like you

791
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:04,979
that was the only thing he'd ever answer
are people like you

792
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:06,450
so idea

793
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,469
right well i mean it it maybe it does
yes

794
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,880
mother interesting thing

795
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,910
now this is the

796
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,109
highly redacted

797
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:15,610
what lesson the channel

798
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,339
someone dump to this

799
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,529
to the screen

800
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:23,259
i don't know if it's legit or not it was
her one's entire identity

801
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:26,210
that may have been the clipboard by
almost wondered if it wasn't an

802
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,289
accidental copy and paste

803
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:29,179
um...

804
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:32,809
and the thing that made me think it
probably was real was the fact that the

805
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:33,859
a_t_m_ him

806
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,519
matches the year of birth

807
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,119
and i was like yeah that that's probably
riyadh

808
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:42,579
so it was a persons entire identity

809
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:45,999
and what that meant to me was while
these guys worked you know while there

810
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:49,749
were some of these guys who were
interested in jest selling

811
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,920
there were also there was also more
going on in this channel

812
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,710
and just our people you know brute
forcing account selling them and moving

813
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,459
on

814
00:36:58,459 --> 00:37:04,679
so the question is there

815
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,879
no i did not

816
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,309
i did not now

817
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,369
uh...

818
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:12,659
i think that that that spending thinking
that because as you know that's

819
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:17,619
i was like this is really cool

820
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:20,889
and again that obviously is not the
person's real i didn't uh... i did

821
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:22,499
change that

822
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:25,609
so the question is what is this all mean
what i've learned from that

823
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:29,319
uh... i really had a hard time coming up
with a conclusion for the spot

824
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:32,290
like i had done all this really cool
stuff i thought that i was like will

825
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,539
what is it all mean

826
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:35,119
and i this is the best i got

827
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,529
um... so other than it was a lot of fun

828
00:37:37,529 --> 00:37:38,909
uh...

829
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:42,699
right romania's across the country

830
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:46,309
a lot of these could be a prisoner
children jack

831
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:48,880
a lot of these folks

832
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,739
are purely script kiddies for hire

833
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:55,239
and i'd hate the transcript katie's
because so many people who use it

834
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,299
don't have the skill level that

835
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:58,860
the script kiddie has

836
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,220
so these are rel derogatory and unlike
stop that like you you can even do what

837
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,079
they do

838
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,190
um... so

839
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,139
but these these folks really are script
kiddies

840
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:09,180
i told them

841
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,669
in the thing bypass and i want to be a

842
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:12,810
i want to be hacker

843
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,659
and they said we're not hackers

844
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,740
we're not hackers

845
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,659
tin in the evenings at the milk to be a
hacker you have to the sequel injection

846
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:23,029
as are ok so

847
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:24,490
so and so they were hurt

848
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,800
so they were really honest about what
their skill level was these words

849
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,859
kilby's one skilled individuals

850
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,089
that i was interacting with

851
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:35,379
they really were just for katie's for
hire

852
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:40,639
kind of what the takeaway you strong
passwords we all should know that

853
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,599
and again

854
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,679
most of their passwords were

855
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,640
you know we want to three password one
two three b this

856
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,169
but they also had some some longer once
more complex ones

857
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:53,259
but not a single one of them had a space
in it

858
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,299
which i thought was kind of interesting

859
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,640
uh... so by putting a space in your
password at least at this point

860
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,349
you would completely deep defeat this
attack

861
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,319
uh... i would suggest running a
cessation another port

862
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,939
not that that's going to get you any
additional security uh... but it does

863
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:09,869
reduce the level of noise

864
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:13,020
uh... if you find somebody banging away
on your pork at

865
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,390
you know uh... if you use a different
four can you find somebody banging away

866
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,340
uh... huh

867
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,859
you should call the cops

868
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,890
but anyways yet this just reduces the
level of noise

869
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,240
because these guys

870
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,419
you know if if any of you are necessary
to have on the internet you'll see

871
00:39:27,419 --> 00:39:33,069
it just didn't he just they're just
nonstop they just constantly go go go

872
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,699
and interestingly enough

873
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:37,969
after i did caught on to the channel
that they were connecting to in the

874
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:39,269
group that it was in

875
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:43,579
that that was controlling my box

876
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:47,499
i don't know if if it was i was always
working with the same group i was always

877
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:49,509
going to the same place

878
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:52,019
so my guess is that this this is pretty
much

879
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:53,219
the group

880
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:54,759
uh... i'm sure there are others

881
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,569
but they seem to find me

882
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:58,779
all the time

883
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,769
i would also suggest fail to ban

884
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:04,270
which uh... uses i_p_ tables to block in
my p

885
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,930
after so many failures to a service the
best thing about that is it's not just

886
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,479
as a state you can do for a few people
do it for other things

887
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:13,060
basically you know that gives them

888
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,279
six accounts

889
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,130
and then they're gone

890
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,229
their they're blocked

891
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:19,979
uh... that's my recommendation

892
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:22,549
um... and that's the end of my talk

893
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:29,339
uh...

894
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:33,369
film companies before going away

895
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,779
what what what what i was really good
