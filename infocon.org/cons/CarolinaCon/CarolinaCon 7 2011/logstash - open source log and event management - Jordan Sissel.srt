uh... so i'm gonna tell u about like
satisfy stars of the project i write

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,950
open-source it's awesome

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,300
this is a love story

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,929
the first legalizing assisted them
echoed at work right now about me dot

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,640
com which does something similar to like
that about a minute

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,390

uh... these its

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,780
no

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,010
uh... with off to a two hundred reynolds
as project satellite housework

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,770
uh...

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,640
on that by writing code

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,850
uh...

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,210
uh...

27
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:44,180
or go another never project government
here last year fortress that stuff

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,520
uh... catherine

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,510
last minute to make a optician go

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,149
scheduler

31
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,259
literally like to show up at the time

32
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,280
and we start writing novels

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,950
almost a serious project with unobserved
predicate recalled finger pumpkin

34
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,810
uh... if you get bored of talk

35
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,100
uh... please feel free trade packet with
product talent i think it would be funny

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,389
uh...

37
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,579
it's about a matzah matzah stop mustard
story

38
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:17,469
uh... so let's talk about loving your
log now and i chaired the michael bolton

39
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,400
at this moment view all come together

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,239
uh... you're next

41
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,679
so firstly estate graph entailed all
really scale

42
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,089
of if you have more than five jeans you
know it if you have to get the structure

43
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:31,999
made have

44
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,430
stage

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,730
as you're there on the spot to be taken
login 'cause they're better devices yet

46
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,629
the bullshit policy thank you for money
machine any access to stop lp blogger

47
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,579
find security problems

48
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:48,319
we'd like windows at the event viewer
you can't really as data that tale it

49
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,300
the first thing i thought about pops up
other into space

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,049
uh... wildly for example

51
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,369
um... sliding as a service to sign up is
free accounts snowballs at freetown keep

52
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:58,219
forever

53
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,649
uh... paper model where you pay for what
you use

54
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,109
houston you're locked up

55
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:06,040
united from a p_r_ top of that

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,049
a lottery is not like staffs were
completely separate their bases

57
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:12,329
uh... lobby is a bunch of i thought it
was a java and logs that is about to

58
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,369
ruby

59
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:17,259
but what we'd like to support
open-source software

60
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:22,019
so they help me gets conferences like
this and they help find other work ahmad

61
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,609
zach

62
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,279
another example project in space agree
like to

63
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,930
uh... we like to use also open source
it's free

64
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,629
uh... you take your log seven among the
bb

65
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,040
and use your next witness

66
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,289
front on top of that

67
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:38,479
but i think we ought to use together
quite a bit because some people don't

68
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,680
like the web front and for the logs
access

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,729
i don't blame you

70
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,059
but you can use likes dash to get your
crap and grill

71
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,349
so what is like that

72
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,259
you take offense justin somewhere and
they could be useful

73
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,479
but they'll be annoying about it really
hate doing software

74
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,959
first on test open-source licenses
b_s_t_ which means i don't like you to

75
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,279
do with it if you use it you love that
you never tell me

76
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:03,980
um...

77
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,499
the idea is that p

78
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:08,489
if you'd like this what you use it under
any circumstances

79
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,719
so there's like gpl i know has some
weird buyer apart

80
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,919
and some companies are very afraid using
like that

81
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,059
uh... suddenly open source is great to
build a community if you hired that's

82
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,819
why it worked monthly

83
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:25,419
uh... and also undermined scrappy
commercial services

84
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,199
which is also

85
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,890
uh... secondly lot like sessions

86
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,569
figuring buyer

87
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,990
but at any if you already have like a
centralized logging system

88
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,909
shouldn't have to like

89
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,509
throw that away here or

90
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,499
make significant changes to get wants us
to work for you

91
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:45,279
if there's a part of life that you don't
want to use for example you hate likely

92
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,139
case you should give us walking out with
a scrappy

93
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,180
and there's a uh... examples that should
be extendable

94
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,379
made it shouldn't be a slight huge
monolithic piece of crap that you can't

95
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,929
inspected barker instead if you have

96
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,350
we're with

97
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,069
applications fell

98
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:08,840
so here's a of rough diagram of

99
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,560
coming out of your servers and going to
somewhere else the spotlight special

100
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,149
issue

101
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:16,959
um... there's no particular inputs
outputs that locks excellent uh...

102
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,330
requires you to write it

103
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,690
daycare you data from server logs from
applications that races from like

104
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,540
tracking an advertising

105
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,779
or dogs devices gentlemen

106
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,649
misunderstood

107
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:33,330
uh... invest on using the logs that
state

108
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,270
which is

109
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,060
three main components

110
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,310
it works similarly to the expect line
react inputs boulders outputs capping it

111
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,039
kind of conflict

112
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,439
and caroline said being filters

113
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,469
uh... so what if it's to react

114
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:50,960
you can read about some files that's
really common that's just what servers

115
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,520
uh... message brokers are getting more
popular

116
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,860
uh... these days for worsening supper
out because i guess normal routers are

117
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,259
collapse anymore anymore things the vote

118
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,060
uh... you people dated from twitter
stream it gary

119
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,389
uh... you know email input

120
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,719
so that's from prague out some things
like that

121
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,309
um... it if you and the events another
way it's not pro who supported it's only

122
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:13,729
to be a couple of the code to make that
work

123
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,159
so imagine filters through so what
filters are do you have

124
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:21,699
firstly a lot of logs are really crappy
format

125
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,889
in if you have multi if you have
different applications i think that's

126
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,680
guaranteed to be lying in a different
format cd different parsers

127
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,489
whatever to figure out which on going to
be

128
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,629
most log formats

129
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:37,259
trip seem to a human readable but mr
simon untreatable by humans or machines

130
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,240
especially agri

131
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,599
and still does exist apart into
something better given structure

132
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,279
four can you help with

133
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,999
you cannot read student ups a message
for her system

134
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:52,179
gap with its own rely incidents elastic
search plastic surgeon open-source tool

135
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,039
for full-text indexing

136
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,529
uh... you can fit into your mind in
terms of someone i guess

137
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:02,650
uh... we can set as a web browser using
met with reporters here

138
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,979
uh... so far leclick out most
applications are capable on servers are

139
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,479
people wanting to files

140
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,159
what's that some people who love doing
roughly tell s_f_o_ nominal trying to

141
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,650
smart appalling um if the files and
repeated things like that

142
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,050
he also watched awhile parts of the few

143
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,370
want two hundred and finally my kids

144
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,310
application in dot instead

145
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,349
you just give me a wild card and figure
out great

146
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:28,330
you'd input from just like to see you
have writers are embedded devices that

147
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,610
can only output only blocks in logs to e
there's something for a while for

148
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,389
tickets for a way that you don't want

149
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,129
where you can send it to me

150
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:35,860
whatsoever

151
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,069
uh... lock-step right

152
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,900
you take it on senator put

153
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,580
um... i said if this is this mirrors the
unix model

154
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,259
it wouldn't be an executed exit

155
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,219
it's it's best brokers are all the rage

156
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,229
might as well set ship is over

157
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,660
uh... for occurs this is great for
broadcasting events

158
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,650
if you have multiple publishers are
multiples subscribers are different

159
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,830
health data

160
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,959
was elsa support starts with a stream

161
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,419
i don't know if it's good to carol
useful but it is great for getting a

162
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,860
rental to be

163
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,610
and frankly my my workstation down
doesn't generate that looks like to put

164
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,099
a review that examples or the filters

165
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,289
uh... the big filter exist because
everyone immensely roads to the time

166
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,409
format more on this little bit

167
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:27,680
and want to ask the in one here

168
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,599
uh... syslog eases one for my daddy idea

169
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,649
uh... so the beatles realty parts that
make it something usually so rides are

170
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,390
done later

171
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,550
with a drug filter works similarly to
reptile you get a real expression in it

172
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,720
drops things that don't match working
make any birth that's workable

173
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,160
out

174
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,480
brock is a filter for parsing

175
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,570
uh... very complex like formats i'll
talk a little bit more about

176
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,650
uh... brought this country is sort of
like prop inverted and again i'll talk

177
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,100
about that shortly

178
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,470
uh... multilateral there's good for java
application to rev up occasions but

179
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,170
don't really know how to log although
information one single line

180
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,160
annex put them on what lines a great
example of this adopt actresses where

181
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,790
the first line is like a tight and crap

182
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,139
and then everything else is adapted by
some kind of thing that you can act on

183
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,010
at services for the lets you take
multiple lines will log file national

184
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,430
together in one of it

185
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,070
for albert's

186
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,250
made up what i like

187
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,850
is classic searches uses unseen which is
a full texas

188
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,420
uh... system on the back end

189
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,910
omics open source that scales

190
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,790
in that uh... three in the community
support for is really good

191
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,050
uh... dislike you can put for message
brokers in

192
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,579
you can't help but to them as well this
lets you take data from your your remote

193
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,940
node ship them over message system

194
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,560
do something that we later in the next

195
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,570
magic relax you really are a lot of
people for the web interface to over

196
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,379
uh... of the ones that itself

197
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,860
at school with me within

198
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,290
uh... the reason for this is really only
supports syslog by the fall and its own

199
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,470
internal is correct

200
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,220
so you can use any of the inputs that

201
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,620
that watch that supports

202
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,860
plus the filters in this shipped off to
grill

203
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,879
so we also output

204
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,449
uh... that's the news eagle databases
like my bb that's what you want to be

205
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,020
doing

206
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,650
there a lot about tools for watching
errors logfile

207
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,550
uh... there some that combine forty
ideas i have it

208
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,960
but sometime

209
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,220
but they're not very good

210
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,650
but with a large national you can easily
streamed into law firm

211
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,380
what files to the fun stuff

212
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,880
figure out what is it your you had

213
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,420
and again we support sockets case you
want uh... ill-timed instinct in your

214
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,980
browser for dashboard

215
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,670
for approx

216
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,880
rehearsed russians are pretty awesome

217
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,620
it gives you a compact syntax for
writing

218
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,350
pattern matching system pattern
recognition

219
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,560
interpret useful but

220
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,590
the pretty awful

221
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,230
writing in his heart

222
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,410
and taking them is harder

223
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,580
into putting a messy divorce especially
i think if they grow

224
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,740
and nobody talks to me right you guys
are unit tests for

225
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,810
and nobody does

226
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,270
exactly you're right wants me kind of
hope

227
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,900
and it works in the future

228
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,450
and nobody really reuse is uh... pattern
speaker before

229
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,150
which helps ensure that you always go
every tiny rhetoric expression

230
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,790
you always get to that people cycle

231
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,730
write it

232
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,310
hope it works don't bother maintaining a
thinking it's not looking at times

233
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,910
so afraid of expressions of so terrible

234
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,650
why developers keep writing pakulak
formats

235
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,920
you see there was a is out

236
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,060
good excuse he contact where some guys
like flying in

237
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,040
it want

238
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,210
uh... i think that's a good his case

239
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,010
uh... forcing regular express delightful
software that

240
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,380
lawns are are inherently structured
right got timestamp you have some kind

241
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,399
of message

242
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,990
media unedited

243
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,840
if you janet alta one string you've lost
all that structure

244
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,640
contributors are really crappy about
figuring out that you have to you as a

245
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,800
human after rights and code parcel

246
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,880
so you end up with a few hundred tools
all logging in please

247
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,370
formats that's not

248
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:31,370
what is this pattern match

249
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,220
once the days

250
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,650
who set up at sea

251
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,100
you would you like shot glass

252
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,860
so we can fill it for you answer

253
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:48,070
that's early

254
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,340
have a sticker activity

255
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,259
can you prove

256
00:12:53,259 --> 00:13:00,259
that it matches pakula

257
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,360
you pick a prophetic doctor does not
match one

258
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,270
and he's talked about

259
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,640
is there

260
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,490
benito tortillas

261
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,000
at the election

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,390
but since it looks good to me

263
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,500
respect over

264
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,690
adult support them

265
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,820
so you guess right this is for apache
logs but not dividing ready to take that

266
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,590
and frankly

267
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,829
if you were writing apache log parser

268
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,720
you would write something like that
effect this complex like you know that

269
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,630
you wouldn't

270
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,649
match septet there that set the forward
september writes that doesn't new

271
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:45,900
usually appear along it seems to me

272
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,949
said it was like it might be said some
good

273
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,529
the problem is more than just regular
expressions humans can't process logs in

274
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,560
aggregate

275
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,830
break if you look at a bunch of apache
log lines

276
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,430
woody what do you see

277
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,350
eugene levy by found that in your brain

278
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,550
over outlines i can't

279
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,290
on the computer stepbrother than either
if they don't have any hinting about

280
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,120
what the format for the city

281
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,110
so they don't know that what is the
what's basically response to things like

282
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,160
that

283
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,460
so here's an example the patchogue that
hopefully is matched by that pattern

284
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,160
that we may or may not attested

285
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,530
a home

286
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,940
this example let's

287
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,639
let's say we want to do some kind of
analytics

288
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,179
on your response maybe we want to get

289
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:36,890
video artist buddiers user

290
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,310
we want that value

291
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,680
now plays brett

292
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,160
for another shot glass

293
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,930
you surely eighty-five possible places

294
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,160
in this line

295
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,380
where

296
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,050
will also find two hundred

297
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,450
or you could also font

298
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,170
side of the year

299
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:07,170
unicycle

300
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
time zone

301
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,970
take mister

302
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,890
you website

303
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,760
um...

304
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,580
and then i think also that request path

305
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,590
and email

306
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,660
if the user id

307
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,760
someone of philip for you

308
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,050
i'm just too tired to fill this morning

309
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,450
not bad

310
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,440
by scott classes in team

311
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,530
their stopped even if you want to start
like now

312
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,840
you you've already lost

313
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,040
so this would be better

314
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,110
became it's it's hard because they'll
still be a problem but if you think rap

315
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,520
on this format you doing it wrong

316
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,350
this is hopefully you witnesses chase on

317
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,550
basic basically a hatch

318
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,190
tells you what the plan addresses with
the user he was not logged into a small

319
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,750
the timestamp in a better format

320
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,350
uh... you know what request form a quiet
place to papers and all that crap and it

321
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,230
was important dates trini how to write a
reference for support

322
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,250
so why is better

323
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,330
is structured pretty much every language
on the planet parse jason's

324
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,680
so you don't have to write code to do it
and its test hopefully someone's past

325
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,320
the day summaries

326
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,440
for example

327
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,399
and has no custom code to rank as you
can it's easy to parse

328
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,999
it's grave all you can just ask for the
response to you don't have to figure out

329
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:36,700
where the string it leads

330
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,250
and best of all you have to write
maintain an apology agree expression

331
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,220
that look like that for kate side

332
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,960
at school you see

333
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,330
maybe you use a binary format maybe you
have a car something maybe your company

334
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,790
hates you would you do have to use excel

335
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,630
uh... seems something structure because

336
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,170
that meet green later

337
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,170
i have another rant we'd stop inventing
time formats

338
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,970
its makes me rage

339
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,980
why chicken stock reinventing time
formats

340
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,240
not yet seen since this number what is
the stall

341
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,840
yet stick

342
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,430
you who said that

343
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,660
he'd

344
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,670
or all of them

345
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:28,670
covered your group my stickers

346
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,860
sins

347
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,690
what is dismissing

348
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,960
milliseconds that's correct anything
else

349
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,430
time zone

350
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,900
those

351
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,800
obvious rubloff sequestered

352
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,930
yes it is missing time so it's not is
missing fractions of a second

353
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,360
uh...

354
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,030
subsys lot to do this

355
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,620
what our problems with this one

356
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,030
no year

357
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,830
and also english leading says popped

358
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,580
which is hopefully october

359
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:19,580
estimates english

360
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,510
apaches this crappy format which is
another inventive when what's problem

361
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,270
this one

362
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,760
beside it being tardy

363
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,330
went two seconds

364
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,770
if you have a actually ready and i don't
we're webserver real traffic he probably

365
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:40,690
wants up second values about by fans

366
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,360
of this one

367
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:49,230
bicycle loves inventing random bullshit
i'm formats

368
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,300
you don't even know

369
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,629
you hope the first two digits might be
here

370
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,140
nod

371
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,700
also the microseconds and instead

372
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,400
everytime

373
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,490
elevated yet in the back and say yes but
at what we are dot i had to use this

374
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,520
thing

375
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,480
deficit

376
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,350
cut coordinates

377
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,510
no

378
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,679
excuse

379
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,680
yeah heroes here but i don't know

380
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,169
it was a high standard rate we can tell
you where but not when

381
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:28,559
and use a comma offer hopefully that's
microsite her milliseconds i'm not

382
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,430
totally sure

383
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,590
sturges

384
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,760
yahoogroups

385
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,010
so if you should be mature in times and
format what she needs

386
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,460
g_i_ so eighty six oh boy

387
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,500
and you can buy the standard and shirt
like off the top dollars or you can just

388
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,740
meet at wikipedia article about it

389
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,360
or this is basically all the information
you need it supports fractions of a

390
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,630
second times of assets

391
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,830
uh... it's not english leaning but it is
that you know north two thousand your

392
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,260
calendar fetchit

393
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,960
um...

394
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,960
and that supports lots of optional
fields if you don't have

395
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,800
houston

396
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,520
means invent your own time format and

397
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,559
i've i've fought

398
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,740
the all of the always a valid and some
of the fields are awfully dot at the

399
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,610
time it gets

400
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,180
for the event that

401
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,510
that happened it's not times not to
speak

402
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,179
specific

403
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:26,690
our credit second whatever

404
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,620
z is for julie which is you can see

405
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,940
it does except elissa comparing on a
different time zones

406
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,850
but i totally agree with you that does
sore properly rate if you look at the

407
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,500
thought time format

408
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,880
the much name is first none of us were
at all

409
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,590
the stop inventing top two terrible one
format still and

410
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,380
t sunshine products' string and hope
that it's going to be useful either

411
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,059
if you have structured it already does

412
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,429
outputted structure

413
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,480
and donate ten times time ports

414
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,190
busy to do it wrongful

415
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,210
let's don't do anything like that

416
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,860
so i think rock earlier

417
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,940
rock exists a sort of solve this problem
people writing terrible on formats cuz i

418
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,520
know people are gonna change

419
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,769
and also forcing timestamp of day
tactics like that

420
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:24,389
lets you write a regular expression once
lets you test them unless you really use

421
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:25,740
them over and over sort of

422
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,120
breaking that horrible vicious cycle of

423
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,220
right terrible

424
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,190
hopefully working written expression

425
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,389
maintaining it maybe

426
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:33,810
debunking it hopefully re

427
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,700
you know you hire insult

428
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,160
you can't read your own pearl three
months later

429
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,240
tears examples of default patterns that
ship with proc

430
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,930
idea of host hostname vicki's eyecare
host is just

431
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,140
or fuzzy nike

432
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,220
uh... i didn't include the full length
of the kind of long sometimes

433
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,370
uh... it's just about a hundred people
patterns but you don't have to write so

434
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,580
what shifts with it

435
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,210
uh... network patterns like mac address
format coming up it s formats

436
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,630
uh... windows likes to use its own
little is that if they think

437
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,030
for mac that addresses

438
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,070
uh... units four mattresses

439
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,490
uh... he talked escalated and i think
cisco uses

440
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,690
four in a dollar for colin or something
like that annette support all of that by

441
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,279
the faulty doctor away

442
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:21,620
it supports numerical patterns for uh...
integer integer members floating-point

443
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,900
values values hexadecimal

444
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,840
uh... scientific notation siegel the
write-ins

445
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,460
comes at the patterns for months like
the song gentry for actually

446
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,250
uh... days of the week high so eighty
six oh one which the times that he

447
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,180
should all be using

448
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,460
hounds disliked i met timestamps which
is what you shouldn't be using

449
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,990
uh... but if you have a rocket

450
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,780
elsa sports now u_s_ and european d

451
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,780
uh... before sir

452
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,990
uh... and also comes with uh... complex
formats like what it strengths which is

453
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,590
not trivial refreshing right

454
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,510
uh... your els which is madness to write

455
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,770
um... answers like headers

456
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,559
annexin testing patterns

457
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,820
this is the with the test week for trial

458
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,299
almost all of the code of is not
necessarily unit testing rocks internals

459
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,360
protesting the patterns ships with

460
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,770
detective runs seven thousand jackson is
growing every time i thought about

461
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,399
uh... see you had better confident about

462
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:16,640
uh... patterns that you cannot

463
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,230
you might be writing rock

464
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,770
rock discovery built on top of what
brock already provides because it shifts

465
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,640
with a library patterns in the hostname
dates numbers that kind of stuff

466
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,250
and you start with a sample

467
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,179
plaintext which might be a piece of
copies of a log file

468
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,010
and it's hard to find patterns the match
that's a little of look at your plane

469
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,360
taxes the out idaho same pattern

470
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,100
does that match tried and try and get a
patent for you

471
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,039
citizen example

472
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,820
uh... syslog line and after you run it
through

473
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,860
uh... sizzler discovery

474
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,840
herb brock discovery sorry

475
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,899
um...

476
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:57,410
it found out that the first chunk of
that was why i called syslog base

477
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,429
uh... and it uses figures up addresses
not actually a regular expression it's

478
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:03,400
actually a constant

479
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,550
so in rather than writing every
expression about jesus is like mine

480
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,380
right at the crack discovery and the
generates one for you

481
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,799
so now instead of

482
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,130
writing a regular expression opening it
works

483
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,190
and repeats matt cycle over and over
again writing them anymore

484
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,870
you getting dislike hinted

485
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,400
uh... version of a apac

486
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,650
hopefully tested

487
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,530
uh... by nina bachelor

488
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,190
again we didn't have to write this

489
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,950
the pattern at the top he started with a
piece of tax from a file

490
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,280
and it gave me a pattern

491
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,929
and that pattern is actually represented
as this

492
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:42,570
uh... and i mentioned earlier that we
have it's just a bunch of patterns and

493
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,070
it starts off this is like bases
actually

494
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,140
uh... i don't think it's back and see

495
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,039
it breaks down into timestamp host and
uh...

496
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,419
programming what's also breaks down and
other things

497
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:58,260
syslog timestamp starts with month day

498
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,780
uh... howard

499
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,840
you can see that pop hopefully in here
you can see that the first thing is

500
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,060
probably a month and and somewhere along
the lines of starts matching numbers

501
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,170
accurate

502
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,010
hosting that zero comma sixty-two stuff
to art he says that wasn't the only the

503
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,050
sixty-two characters long

504
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,980
between dot some bullshit

505
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,930
uh... so that's why i wrote with

506
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,040
so you get patterns automatically
generated for you never had to write a

507
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,710
regular expression you don't have to be

508
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,850
a computer science major to understand
buys exchange rate bullshit that stuff

509
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,790
that people wrote logs that were crappy

510
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,280
he scrapbooks

511
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,010
so each piece that

512
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,299
rockies is for you is tested reusable

513
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:48,350
so you don't have to worry about that
orval cycle

514
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,800
three slugfest agent ruling on a little
bit

515
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,000
is capable of

516
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,960
having an input needs a bunch of filters
and a bunch of helpless

517
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,270
this is an acceptable example if you
were to run long staff on a single as

518
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,120
yourself

519
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,440
you have a bunch of files as important
as database logs uh... things like that

520
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,050
and you have a bunch of filters you
might use props first to sort of

521
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,789
parts

522
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:12,850
uh... the crappy about formats and
something internally structure

523
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,850
use a big part of the to take the basic
rock found from from the

524
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,390
uh... the logs in turn them into real
time stamp

525
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,200
they do you have some job a lot to
wherever you want is multiplied gentlest

526
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,440
up until a month

527
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,140
or one event for the ship it off the
last search

528
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,240
disliking complex example if you have a
bigger structure

529
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,669
you have a bunch of servers

530
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:35,910
doing doing that same thing in the last
line

531
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,720
uh... all of them this is what one
server might look like

532
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,880
and is that about putting two elastic
searcy output to message broker and keep

533
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,190
the for example

534
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,949
bullshit appliance yes exactly

535
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:53,200
c bop is like bullshit searchlights from
unknown search company

536
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,280
uh... that maybe only logs internally or
we don't like the syslog if you have to

537
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,020
do

538
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,620
so you have i'll put it to your locks s
server itself

539
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,710
uh... you have your other routers stuff
and that ships off to media filtering

540
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,519
buster

541
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,179
because maybe you have said we want for
second

542
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,710
or you see if you use it on your

543
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,840
and u_n_ noses

544
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,549
seems to me

545
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:14,170
prove crucial to spend parsing data

546
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,660
so you sent off on parsed to uh... fleet
of machines at the rand rock indie

547
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,720
parsing for you

548
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,350
and those internship ship them off to a
lesser so whatever happened to that

549
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,090
point

550
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,960
so we have a leadership logs

551
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,310
measurements so what's next

552
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,809
the whole point of parsing

553
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:35,330
all this crap some structure putting it
somewhere

554
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:41,490
it's easy to search annalise on that
later

555
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,360
there's a lot about the deficits like

556
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,570
uh... the main goal of this is to be
able to

557
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,240
quickly departing

558
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,440
uh... you you don't get a strong
analytics he'll get like fancy height

559
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,770
arts or

560
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,740
i'd like that now uh... as i had

561
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,460
but it that is coming this is this is

562
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,539
popped up

563
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:01,460
i thought was the judge relied too
earlier you can use both of these in the

564
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,470
same system

565
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,990
uh... so

566
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,320
searched my field

567
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,140
so if you were part of a statement of a
funny to search for hosting colin was

568
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,330
seen as a all this at all this as the
pop up

569
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,640
you get a graph of results over time if
you have respond to any other um...

570
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,390
allotment system to get similar result
on the people

571
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:27,480
uh... this is just a histogram of hits
for this uh... search result over time

572
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,160
yet but there is also here this is this
is interactive

573
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,470
when you click on it this field this
this box pops up of the pictures of the

574
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,980
breakdown of the events of this is what
brock pulled out of

575
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,309
sis login

576
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:44,350
in from this dissection

577
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,490
on the slide you can

578
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,150
uh... click on any of these these fields
and it will modify your search now

579
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,500
you're not writing

580
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,830
yet figuring out how to use the search
language

581
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,960
you just sort of drilling into your logs

582
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,000
and you can include or exclude so if you
want to exclude issue which is

583
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,780
if operation half thad

584
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,670
so the whole goal of of this is to of
les aspin is to take a day that put it

585
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,610
somewhere they can also

586
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,350
so this is a graph when i started
indexing twitter

587
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,779
border has again that

588
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,190
the equipment orders sky

589
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,190
i say

590
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,440
data filter on i think xp p

591
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,530
it's really its holiday two percent

592
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,129
and ideally no to do with it

593
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:26,690
so i started searching for tweets

594
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,490
and this is week this is a certain
search in that same day this effort

595
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,800
weeds matching sounds as if it

596
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,280
also if you're looking for rent because
that's that's the stream form

597
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,950
footers is like what i would call the
lord that some of random datasets

598
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,660
it's kind of like

599
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:48,660
uh... deb random for the human race if
you're looking for that

600
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,550
respond to you about ski

601
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,520
about

602
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,830
but we had come prepared

603
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:06,260
uh... flash trask son of a bitch

604
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,980
slick source

605
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,429
accruing

606
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,990
it's like a lot of demo come on

607
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,020
but i sacrificed infinite anyway

608
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,920
so this was going to be a live demo of

609
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,950
this

610
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,800
pretend that sanity

611
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,730
it's amazing

612
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,230
progress this would have been video
would have made it may be sure that

613
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,419
uh... the graphs

614
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,929
itself is interactive c_d_ click on the
floor bars

615
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:41,040
edited

616
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,720
clicking on the uh... the drill down
into smaller font timeframe may be

617
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,670
looking at

618
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,010
jimmy

619
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,730
in this was supposed to be a demo of the
what u pornographic

620
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,160
of this where if you have a flashed

621
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,340
reads like it

622
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,300
uh... so it past and future

623
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,010
speakers

624
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,759
so mustache was first released love
november of last year

625
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,570
um... there's a handful of people using
it now and we've got we've got a lot of

626
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,350
attack is coming in

627
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,740
you can see happy with it

628
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,780
when i release it took less than a day
for a and

629
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:25,070
uh... unnamed commercial on management
sales guy start rolling in twitter

630
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,619
and i know that i mentioned earlier that
open source is a great thing uh...

631
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,460
to work on for causing fee

632
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,550
uh... no

633
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,940
maybe no comment

634
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,120
um...

635
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,520
another again opens wednesday for
causing fear and panic and commercial

636
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,670
um...

637
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,330
alternate

638
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,019
'em a lot of times people uh...

639
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:50,789
commercial bailey or call that we have
freight of of

640
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:53,690
of mice equality by bicycle spot

641
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,580
prospects now

642
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,010
i guess of fear turns into buying stuff

643
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,379
the competition for for these these like

644
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,470
the sales organizations

645
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,160
likes plugin at lot logic i think and

646
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,470
some of the companies

647
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,610
ego for the details model but if you can
t that

648
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,650
like trick people

649
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,190
ever like show them that you know this
three people

650
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,769
his things like free stuff up a bit of
the sock and solve the problem without

651
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:22,590
housing them you know like millions of
dollars a year for bullshit licenses

652
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,450
i think it's cool

653
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,549
and if a troubling you

654
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,210
you've already won

655
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,769
anyway of lunch that's why i was
supposed to be due out

656
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:31,879
uh... today

657
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:35,320
but i drank too much so he'll be coming
out this week

658
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:42,320
what if you can use it now units on out
of stock meetings and how to do it

659
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,980
historiography

660
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,760
uh... his this doesn't work anyway

661
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,269
hate my life

662
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:58,039
uh... the project status like set aside
that of the code is off on guitar

663
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,869
appears issues we used era

664
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:05,000
uh... turns out your is actually you're
project manager

665
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,020
um...

666
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,590
uh... we have a c sports and all this
couple dozen they're pretty much all the

667
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,680
time

668
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,320
uh... also but i don't want lian logs
that stickers to get out

669
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,240
it

670
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,900
ever wins a lot stash

671
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,889
uh... the logos

672
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:19,989
wisdom

673
00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:25,909
i care for now sex and the french

674
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:32,909
any questions

675
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,690
so the question was how does a scale
what if i have a good million against

676
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,200
the days not really much that that
attends a really couple

677
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,529
around two percent

678
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:54,430
uh... but you would do something similar
to this where um...

679
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,960
use sorting things out you have multiple

680
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,650
mostly doctors the elastic search if
using that for the back-end that

681
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,940
unskilled looking packing grow you can
use uh... message brokers to helps fill

682
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,830
out your parsing infrastructure if you
need to get which should g_o_p_ lobby

683
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,339
instruction formats

684
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:18,359
that's a question

685
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,809
now you can grow horizontally on aunty
anna in each year

686
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,179
here i don't c what your

687
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,179
uh... couple thousand bits per second or
box

688
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:33,149
but after point you here at disk space
about out per second stops being useful

689
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:34,339
zero

690
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,899
angelique

691
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:40,699
ideally if you're not using filters
because you using star star cuban format

692
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:44,299
uh... we should just give it to whatever
back in civil rights

693
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,480
and that's why

694
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,239
we allow so many different outline uh...
targets the domestic search at the bar

695
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,419
or maybe had scaling problem he wants
which is something else bicycle or money

696
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:57,079
your way

697
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:04,079
so if the flexible

698
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:16,470
so rock itself is an open source library
room that's

699
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:23,470
spec external to lock-step slugfest
issues that has a filter

700
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:25,249
dot that's all

701
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:29,429
but had to be fair i i serve right
rockley for five years ago so

702
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:33,729
was a really it was for fund then so i
was looking for is this problem already

703
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:39,059
solved

704
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:41,659
and it's not a heart problem solving me
if you write a pattern and give it a

705
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:42,290
name

706
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,000
it's for using like string substitute

707
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,389
take the word hosting this replace it
with that massacring expressing tested

708
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:53,499
right there's nothing too fancy about

709
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:57,209
it's open source in separate it's
written in c so you can use it from

710
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:04,209
uh... dealing with together finds work

711
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:06,539
it also has a stand-alone program

712
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,849
the right config files or to have it be
something similar to a lot better here

713
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:10,509
where

714
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:15,549
it'll run files are are tail files or
uh... run pansy democratic patterns of

715
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:22,329
that sort of like reactions

716
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:27,569
full either stickers please take them

717
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:29,789
uh... yet it immensely

718
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:36,789
yet you know it

719
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:24,639
ip

720
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:28,910
these are all my videos

721
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:35,910
skinny

722
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:42,689
and he's been doing always ends up
pretty fierce fermin in in i'm sure

723
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:46,449
uh... it's telling me something

724
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:53,449
weinberg campus

725
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:14,509
sanctions

726
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:22,399
right headed back for a month it didn't
work out well

727
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:27,069
here's what i said

728
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:32,559
today

729
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,349
hope eight internet

730
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:39,319
it

731
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:45,529
hiding

732
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:52,169
uh...

733
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:54,009
you just heard the internet

734
00:38:54,009 --> 00:39:01,009
bayer

735
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:10,459
executive if you had atkins

736
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:13,940
experience at least

737
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:19,929
so

738
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:24,209
about it

739
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:28,019
it'll be a race first guy yet

740
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,150
uh... apply

741
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,319
if we had uh... i don't know

742
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:38,319
out

743
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:58,669
at sticker

744
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:09,619
we can watch that after of though
fullscreen

745
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:13,139
so i apologize for the body anyway so we
are searching for something i clicked on

746
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:14,099
that spike

747
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,969
because of the body of problem

748
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:19,719
and there's a bunch of results click on
a result and there's all this stuff

749
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:23,459
on then i decide that's not what i want
to look for apologize for the planes

750
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:26,009
research for cis logs

751
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,279
click on the first thing and i want to
put products modifies the search that

752
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:34,849
was there for problems

753
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,059
that's it

754
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:43,089
all of us

755
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:50,089
uncertainties

756
00:40:57,409 --> 00:41:02,509
so this was let's restrain going right
to my browser

757
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:06,629
if

758
00:41:06,629 --> 00:41:13,159
attributes

759
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:19,209
i make this windows moulder

760
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:25,139
calif entrances looking back i was acts

761
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:26,639
as that

762
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,529
behaviors

763
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,959
here

764
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:35,269
except stopped

765
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:38,729
goal so this is one of our entire for
going through

766
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:39,790
that's where it work

767
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,680
being filtered

768
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,500
and then going to what i could help with

769
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,799
and now this again is like executable

770
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:47,899
this amount of data is not useful

771
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:51,529
but if you were here this is mostly
uh... tailed asset for your entire

772
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:52,839
infrastructure

773
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:53,680
whistle

774
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,599
that's why it is

775
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:05,599
we saw a bunch of uh... terrace talked
with

776
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,719
out

777
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:14,039
functions

778
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:17,259
onassis spins out of poverty and missing
fonts

779
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:20,269
has its limits

780
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:26,179
now this is a less google chrome

781
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:31,029
so if i had without actually

782
00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:33,439
yet

783
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:34,799
website at sierra

784
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:41,799
which unfortunately really supported by
pupil ellis

785
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:43,769
yes yes

786
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,500
so they were blocks because it's all a
man's uh...

787
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,809
yumiko stuff but i didn't have that onto
like that

788
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,699
user

789
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:58,419
so that was a problem

790
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:05,419
i think i might actually have another
more realistic

791
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:16,089
yes system

792
00:43:17,189 --> 00:43:19,579
historia

793
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:21,659
stuff comes in a real time

794
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:25,089
uh... doesn't feed like

795
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:30,079
trying to fit in three thousand things
hold

796
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,609
so yes the using moderate style

797
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:40,609
this is a pops up this all

798
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:46,630
seriously

799
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:51,189
uh... terrain fifteen or twenty five ram
logs and shipping it through

800
00:43:51,189 --> 00:43:56,769
help

801
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:58,079
assault

802
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,689
i don't wanna

803
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:00,319
accounts
