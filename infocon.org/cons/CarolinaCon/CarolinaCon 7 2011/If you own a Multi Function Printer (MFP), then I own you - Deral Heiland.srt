1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,979
so my presentation today it is uh...

2
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:10,260
if you know multifunction printer
denying you

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,609
or potentially

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:14,789
obviously not all of my bad and not

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:15,950
all over p_d_'s

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,080
nonvolatile fashion but today's
presentation we're gonna be discussing

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,559
uh... multifunction printers and uh...

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,759
hacking multifunction printers

9
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,419
and stealing paid off monthly
multifunction so

10
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:30,800
corporate and

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,420
home office type style systems

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,020
on from the date on our region

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,620
uh... come up here or come down here
every year with uh... much of my friends

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,310
i've been a ninety for eighteen years

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,730
uh... i've been in security for eight
plus years industrial is yours and

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,140
working as a security scan tester
assessment you hear that type of stuff

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,390
uh... a member of the proof is next
enough you're familiar with that uh...

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,160
that's occurred itself

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,210
of the victim's uh... at g dot

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,450
twins

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,590
on this much forty or presented at the
carolina conscious effort to learn

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,250
into a come here every year

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,979
so uh...

24
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,350
no one's ever hit me with a beer bottle
yet so hopeful

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,830
will make it through this one too

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,490
before they come on fess thing

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,500
so let's go to get started uh...

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,410
and today's agenda we're gonna be
talking about uh...

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,430
multifunction printer xander functions
and features and what this functions and

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,510
features me

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,440
we're gonna talk about tacky
multifunction printer license

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,990
the why when how and leveraging the data
that we gather off these devices

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,430
of course we're gonna have a few demos i
don't think anyone ever as ever see me

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,080
do a presentation without businesses are
always fun to get a couple

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,120
two very simple demos to uh...

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,840
make the point here

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,010
thing again sunglasses on

38
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,760
and there were to talk about that the
toll that we released earlier this year

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,980
called trader

40
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,080
so let's go and get started on uh...
multifunction printers functions and

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,409
features

42
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,409
so what what is our ultimate goal our
goal is to be able to leverage data off

43
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,729
these printers they could be used to
carry out attacks against

44
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,010
bother corporate

45
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,959
the type of features that we're we're
looking for a long printers are for

46
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,599
example erlich email

47
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,819
uh... the server settings the address
books that contain usernames and may

48
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,939
contain passwords

49
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,159
uh... we're showing samples alerts

50
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,539
uh... faxing services that contains
contact information usernames again

51
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:36,419
usernames are ever have to the puzzle in
a brute force attacked so there are

52
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,279
value to an attacker

53
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:41,709
uh... and that information pulled from
address books

54
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,399
uh... we're also talking about the
skinny function out a lot of these

55
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,979
multifunction printers you can walk up
to them

56
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:49,759
and they have what's interesting in the
file functions that meeting pushing

57
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,849
paper what everyone skin on their it's
general actually sportsman stored on a

58
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:59,949
have microsoft file server restore hefty
p a service server somewhere

59
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,080
uh... so we're looking at those cities
uh...

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,569
system settings user settings

61
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,879
also a lot of these devices interact
with help that

62
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,789
uh... the bility to walk up to some
leave large-scale printers and at the

63
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,799
ticket yourself that the whites will
house the label do that

64
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,219
it integrates with in the corporate
spelt that server

65
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,699
in some fashion a new way to do that

66
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,099
is it has to have uh... uh

67
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,909
way to connect to the next as that
username or password but itself

68
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,039
potentially

69
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,579
to meld that server so we're looking for
those type of features and functions

70
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,989
along it is always a wealth of
information there's a lot of the whites

71
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,279
is out there specifically collar
predators

72
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:40,119
that locking up detailed information you
can be chargeback function so actually

73
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,059
what the users uh...

74
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:43,359
network using

75
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,239
in the login system every time there's a
print job

76
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,179
and of course uh...

77
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:52,559
the uh... the remote retrieval of uh...
print scan or fax jobs off these devices

78
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:55,359
could also uh... be of some value

79
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,009
suffer certain widows were start looking
at some of these features

80
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:03,329
on uh... some of the more large-scale
multifunction devices out there

81
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,549
this case we're talking about it this
year in the studio

82
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:10,149
so uh... this is underneath their
ministers briefly blow that up we look

83
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,159
at some of the setting

84
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,819
functions that are here

85
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,139
uh... examples the network settings
email settings which may contain

86
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,139
information for s and t p to be able to
stand kato recipe p server

87
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,580
say that spot which was this uh... data
back here

88
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,949
uh... which is a ski in the file
function which contains information etc

89
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:31,780
and should be used to log onto a server
at the store that data

90
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,289
internet fax it haven't dug into that
one that sounds interesting

91
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,349
and various other functions and features
that exists on this device

92
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:41,580
the next one

93
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,660
a real quick on his is candid image
runner

94
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,929
blow-up of

95
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:49,189
these services over here we see the
additional functions that we have on

96
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,110
these places

97
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,789
register all your help that service as
i've mentioned said this contains uh...

98
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:59,289
username unification information stored
on the printer to connect to the l that

99
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:00,569
service

100
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:05,580
of the course that it's over here if we
go further down to the important export

101
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,460
visibility dua for backup

102
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,560
of various stuff off the printer maybe
the configurations of the printer

103
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,060
it may actually be address books very
seems like that's were actually in the

104
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,050
show

105
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,389
how uh... this export data can be used
to retrieve a lot of the score

106
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,539
information that may be of value tax
system

107
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,509
uh... xerox uh...

108
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,249
uh... work center program

109
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:31,060
millions of these out there cn

110
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,719
work vance models come up every day

111
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:37,659
and here we go also have uh... as we
exploded the screen various settings

112
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:40,809
under protocols we obvious anisotropy

113
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:45,289
uh... you know if a company actually
configures as an example acid in p to be

114
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,719
no other than public or private because
they want to manage it in some fashion

115
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:53,650
what's the chance of that new community
string being used on other systems

116
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,199
within the organizations that's
dedicated should be used to attack with

117
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,180
uh... also s of t_p_ services is
highlighted down there that would

118
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,639
obviously be uh... connection into

119
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,249
email system

120
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,509
uh... and it may contain syndication
information so that

121
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,710
uh... faxes can be sent out

122
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,620
through email or receive emails for
faxes and stuff like that

123
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,509
uh... we go on to another screen with
the new xerox and come down in the

124
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,190
cloning function of this is a really
fascinating function cloning functions

125
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,879
ability for the printer

126
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,550
uh... let's say you have

127
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,719
fifty xerox printers you needed the
point of view writercorporation

128
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:35,169
do you really want a log in the each one
of these and configure we don't have to

129
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:37,759
you can actually do the clotting
function

130
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,599
uh... make a snapshot of a configured
printer

131
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,960
and the point that out to as many
systems issued me too

132
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,580
over the over the wire three printer
functions

133
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,159
so i think this is the last one were to
touch base on from configuration

134
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,889
standpoint has a right to know

135
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,889
again this is very similar to the other
printers that we've looked at same type

136
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,539
of functions and features

137
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,860
it has logging email activity to the s_
and t_ peas underneath there

138
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,550
fall transferability tiffany k transfer
files two systems

139
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,229
and we also have held that services as
an expensive example

140
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,360
these devices affinity to and all that
server pretty much all the same type of

141
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,940
functions and features

142
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,319
now they're implemented security various
different fashions worn

143
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,759
each printer

144
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,409
or alter the goal is to

145
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,819
rob steal cheat and plunder these things
as much as we possibly can

146
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,970
so let's go ahead to get into that uh...

147
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,120
attacking multifunction printers

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,210
so why do we want to tak multifunction
printers and i said it a bunch of times

149
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,589
already gather information

150
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:42,879
one escalate our rights and other core
systems within a corporation one of the

151
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,870
easiest passive davis in the one that's
most likely to be board

152
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,870
is that the web interface one

153
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,860
multifunction printers

154
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,289
so what are we gonna do this topic
expose them to the internet you say one

155
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,779
hell of a new expose a printer to the
internet

156
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,599
obviously you have a google

157
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,259
the internet

158
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,500
for printers

159
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,329
it is it is is horrified the number
printers it out there

160
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,579
and it's even more horrifying the number
of cars out there with default passwords

161
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,479
to a settlement

162
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,499
as an assessment engineer michael
formally finds printer setup

163
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:21,279
uh... expose the internet it's more of
what i see

164
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,569
third cessnas if i do a college or
university they have this open

165
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:29,069
thing about them they like to make
everything free and open to everybody

166
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:34,850
those cases i've seen how multifunction
printers exposed to the internet

167
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,590
the other thing is is uh... you know
once you gain foothold

168
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,040
into an organization as a primary
samples of this

169
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,030
was only like uh... two weeks ago turns
susman from the internet

170
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,240
i was able to d_n_a_

171
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,790
pat username and password vindicator
masses of the p and for the company

172
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,440
levels ot

173
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,509
very limited access all i got was their
extra net

174
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,250
webpages full things about company

175
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,940
and one employees need it

176
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,160
but it turns out it was a chipper use in
the past report with hadn't figured

177
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,980
right

178
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,510
so basically all i had to do with past
internal i_p_ addresses as portal

179
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,190
and it would attempt to connect over a
year four four three year a_t_t_ or

180
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,250
whatever that web service was

181
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,310
so uh... using information gathered from
another webserver identified the

182
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,770
internal i_p_o_ dresses

183
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,630
put together a script uh... and started
planet

184
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,250
against their juniper

185
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,970
in a basically start looking for web
interfaces on the internal network

186
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,810
soon found they weren't are

187
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,610
printer sub

188
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,550
uh... was able crawl through about
thirty different printers in retriever

189
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,630
vital information that actually helped
us escalate more access into their or

190
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,790
systems

191
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,350
so it's a foothold approach you get a
single foothold the slum in it

192
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,380
but if i can read predators are accessed
the predators

193
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,900
game over some cases

194
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,620
and the other thing is that you know

195
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,300
you're sending work one day in your
board so he swore screw somebody over

196
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,740
there's a type of people who may go
after these things a look at the

197
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,130
printers

198
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,560
unfortunately or fortunately a lot of
times they've been ignored up to this

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,480
point right here

200
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,340
uh... and i have been

201
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,950
generating all kinds of the ways about
multifunction printer funding were all

202
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,160
we're also familiar

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,170
with this this thing has been you've
been hearing over and over ten on c_n_n_

204
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,039
dole printer hard drives

205
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,540
copier hard drives

206
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,510
everyone's runaround will help you god
we're losing all this information

207
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,680
and they still totally more

208
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,810
the stuff here

209
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,250
uh... when i'm creating often always
uh...

210
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,610
that that's going to change of people to
start pay more attention to

211
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,540
their multifunction printers and
organizations that were to get a better

212
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,639
security out there which is what the old

213
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,670
gayness it's not

214
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,880
in security is security

215
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,760
so how we can attack multifunction
printers

216
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,780
and we'll discuss each here today
obviously leveraging default passwords

217
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,670
well familiar with that it's if u

218
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,760
put a printer in place you don't change
default password you have access that

219
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,020
way

220
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,940
access bypass attacks

221
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,480
talk about that

222
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,830
information leakage attacks once again
access where we get this information

223
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,410
from

224
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,370
forceful browsing attacks very similar
to axis bypassed sets but a little

225
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,150
different

226
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,480
pass back to tak them

227
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,660
want to talk about that i don't want my
speech on that right now

228
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,410
in that also back up a clinic function
we're gonna dig into those

229
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,490
uh... with a couple demos uh... deal
with xerox uh... cloning functions in

230
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,180
there

231
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,940
downloadable module creation process

232
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,580
so default passwords uh... mostly uh...
most serious that major fail

233
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,280
and we're all familiar with this

234
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,100
how many people in here uh...

235
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,490
have all the passwords on their printers
at work and satin change so that not the

236
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,260
default

237
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,800
yet i was about as many as i had a
reason shinu

238
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,210
so its product sample you get it

239
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,690
very small percentage and that's what i
find during assessments

240
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,720
uh... i find most the time the printers
have no password step towards a factory

241
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,610
default password set on it so now i do
have access

242
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,490
where do we get the passwords uh...
product manuals always a good source of

243
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,320
here's some links down here

244
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,400
and of course will make these flights
available these links and go to some

245
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,840
password databases available internet

246
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,380
passwords down

247
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,420
and at this point i think think i'd like
memorize like half of the passwords for

248
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,210
most of printers there

249
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,670
but not all of

250
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,870
that's michael

251
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,480
again the next day or want to talk about
pass

252
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,340
uh... bypass tax

253
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,840
of the billy bypass of the
authentication

254
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,620
the white space kuwait willing with the
york

255
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,450
aseem weird stuff to it uh...

256
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,590
various changes in the ural request to
make the device go yet sure here you can

257
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,310
have my content

258
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,880
uh... we have two examples a-one us
achieve though and the other one we're

259
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,450
gonna action demo

260
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,350
with the office gentleman to cheaper

261
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,580
if we look at this is that you are all
that you would pass to achieve a printer

262
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,270
and we do this is going to redirect you
over to the login login dot html

263
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,570
breach t_m_

264
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,430
in this case here the password would be
about one two three four five six by

265
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,820
default

266
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,330
but if that doesn't work for what do you
do next

267
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,330
all turns out that

268
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,170
what i found out was shortly by accident

269
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,220
so how many of us who will commonly will
will cut and paste your ups right cut

270
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,950
and pasted worth doing testing cut paste
cut

271
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,050
what was going to cut and paste

272
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,479
and i a m partly

273
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,100
left the extra slash in there

274
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,160
uh... between top access an
administrator

275
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,319
and believe it or not took me right in

276
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:44,000
system of that

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,370
required a syndication

278
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,960
so that's kind of interesting

279
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,450
you know we got a demo care

280
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,830
uh... and this is that

281
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,390
this is a pasta scan uh... office jets

282
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,270
uh... h_p_ divisive you see these a lot
of people buy these diameter

283
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,000
about spire whatever

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,709
but it turns out that i'd run into these
in corporate america a lot

285
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:12,810
people what to put these in the office
of the expense of

286
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,650
i don't know how much

287
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,320
dated you can get off the how much
integration they do the various models

288
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
have more more integration

289
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
but uh... this particular model

290
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,640
had some issues that i want to show that
to you

291
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,300
deal with uh... bypass attack

292
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,610
so we bring it would bring up the street
years fairly straightforward uh... this

293
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,740
is the home page it redirects you to the
uh... uh... kadam though franco

294
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,490
uh... if we try to go to some of the
setting setting

295
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,660
and networking to try to get those
fields and the password set

296
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,440
it prompts you for the password

297
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
the truth is i don't have a free
conclude

298
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,630
password like changes so long ago i
forgot

299
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,319
but uh...

300
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:58,390
the stuff initiated that you really so

301
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,430
uh... say just a cancel

302
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,990
all over we can see that your alternates
loaded up bigger

303
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,060
but see goes to the unauthorized sophie
cut this out here

304
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,490
pagey walls fax address book one

305
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,770
and just paste it back in so that we
have a page equals page equals fax

306
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,590
address book one it bypasses the
security gives us access

307
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,380
of the funny thing about the whole thing
is is

308
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,070
between the first and second page equal

309
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,640
because basically put anything you want

310
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,480
and it still works

311
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
i'm not sure

312
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,750
white's doing that

313
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,010
which at least you page equals to get
this thing

314
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,760
uh... so so easily can bypass and get
access about ninety percent

315
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,350
of the studies on this device is if you
think you can change without

316
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,530
the password that is the actual password

317
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:58,530
why the hell would you want

318
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,410
okay let's go ahead move on to other
next section and that is uh...

319
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,100
information leakage attacks

320
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,290
so we've gained access what next

321
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,030
okay would be four password gives us
access

322
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,009
we've found

323
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:14,250
methods to bypass the security on
certain devices

324
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,589
where we take it from there

325
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:18,430
how do we gain access to the state of
the raft

326
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,800
so the first what we're gonna look at
his feet to cheaper

327
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,550
phyllis go ahead to explode this up so
we have to stop this

328
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,550
on the screen israel supple

329
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,380
key piece of information if you see in
new york elders to slashes in their side

330
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,940
by past security to get to this
particular page

331
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,540
which is a ski in the file

332
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,380
uh... configuration page

333
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,150
so we have in here we have the
servername and the server uh... over

334
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,980
structure

335
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,610
here we have the active directory to
maintain in the actual username

336
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,829
down here is that

337
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:48,800
that infamous

338
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,489
blah blah blah blah blah

339
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:53,260
that we all are gotten so custom to
looking at

340
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,530
with the iso

341
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,100
does anyone really paid attention about
what sitting behind that specially when

342
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,140
you deal with embedded systems

343
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,590
actually it's the password

344
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,670
so if you right click on that field

345
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,030
and would go up

346
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,630
you know in firefox right-click
properties you can go right to this in

347
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,230
in plain text the password existing

348
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,699
i've yet to find a modern multifunction
printer that did not put it

349
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,110
plaintext

350
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,220
a few years back about uh... pop

351
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,290
through four years ago i did find some
there were actually base sixty four

352
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,709
thirty but thats

353
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,270
progression to

354
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,870
they don't bother doing that anymore
it's just plain text

355
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,780
so that we move on to

356
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,740
the actual image runner

357
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,429
uh... this is

358
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,110
fairly similar type thing

359
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,430
to explode this up and we get the
username

360
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,450
the password and those nice little
blocks again

361
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,810
and the domain name

362
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,490
this was a little different

363
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,040
when you right click on this go
properties

364
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,250
it will take you to

365
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,390
a whole bunch of black dots

366
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,800
but if you follow the date out to the
end of the line

367
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,649
it made a java call

368
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,690
you follow that java call

369
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,090
it takes you down to these hidden tax

370
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,190
where we have date plaintext password
again to be in store

371
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,640
um... sewed never assume kinda look at
the code follow it through to make sure

372
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,640
that they have not on the stated some
bizarre stupid fashion

373
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,370
one thing up

374
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,320
talk about things

375
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,369
on this particular one right here

376
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,350
uh... the gauge man i was alone

377
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,430
this particular to sheba printer

378
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,799
was actually

379
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,680
being used by the payroll department

380
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,370
show you what i guess what they were
scanning and

381
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,720
payroll documents you want to

382
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,330
worst part was

383
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,900
they were nice enough to restrict this
user he could only get access to this

384
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,550
folder right here

385
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,410
he get access to anything within the
domain that was every

386
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,970
because every time you create users a
member of everyone

387
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,200
but the restricted key people we get
access to that

388
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,000
but they were nice enough to actually
store all of the for payroll system

389
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,410
backups in that same folder for me

390
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,920
so eyesight basically quickly downloaded
the five gig payroll system extracted it

391
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,690
out and pulled down

392
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,840
uh... i think was like

393
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,480
fifteen hundred twenty-five hundred holy
credentials and it was pretty much

394
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,020
everything their bank account
information

395
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,299
uh... payroll deduction information so
security numbers everything this person

396
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:18,080
uh...

397
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,770
and it was available fully accessible
because of

398
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:26,450
a printer being used in the environment

399
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,030
so that's what we're talking about is
uh...

400
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,840
forceful browsing

401
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,350
visibility to if you know what the you
are ellis

402
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,100
you can just enter straightening not
follow the normal path of access

403
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,270
and we actually have a

404
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,340
in this example here

405
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,230
i'd like to point out that it's common
that

406
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,310
they're the most common

407
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,450
file types

408
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,500
or usually properly secured

409
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,070
things like dot c_ g_ i_ dot htm dot
html

410
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,150
from a security standpoint

411
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,919
uh... typically or

412
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,590
properly security try to get to those
two forceful browsing

413
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,270
the security mechanism on the device
would usually gab grab that

414
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,639
but on the vice is that use other

415
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:11,700
file names

416
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,020
that don't fall in these normal

417
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,150
styles

418
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,630
it's not unusual be able to just
retrieve those to a forceful browsing

419
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,840
averages yet

420
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,580
uh... the other example is is uh... it's
very common find some web page is uh...

421
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,840
that arts festival

422
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,930
through links

423
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,510
twenty secure page

424
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,110
so you try to get to this case it's
secure

425
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,960
but if you can access the links

426
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,390
are secure

427
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,390
so if you know what the links or can go
straight to the bypass and their lame

428
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,930
attempt at obviously in security

429
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,490
so we have two examples here the first
one is that image runner which is a

430
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,440
unprotected file type

431
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,780
and the second what we'll do the office
skin right here

432
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,059
uh... we're we're talking about they
forceful browsing and buying tickets in

433
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,860
the secure cage

434
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,330
but we know what you are a lark

435
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,770
and we can actually trigger some
operational on this device

436
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,640
by just injected right into the euro

437
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,769
so the first one

438
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:08,639
is uh...

439
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:12,720
image runners turns out that it would
runners have by default

440
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,070
uh... eleven address books

441
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,669
uh... once of and to get access to these
address books

442
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,680
from a forceful browsing attack you have
to have a valid cooking

443
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,180
so you get about cookie by finicky

444
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,800
but on some models all you have to do is
get the home page first

445
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,030
it will give you a valley tricky

446
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,770
and then you could be forceful browsing
through the actual files of the address

447
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,390
book files in this case

448
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,630
uh... if you look down at the bottom
we're looking at dot held the i_r_s_ in

449
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,640
this particular case

450
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,930
i hit the home page and then i think
were the various address book straight

451
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,540
up

452
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,280
and had to give me that information

453
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,630
so here's one of the address books from
actual agement

454
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,080
reported down it won't go slow address
books what value of those but the damage

455
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,970
runners

456
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,029
typically contain

457
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,940
other cool information

458
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,400
explode this up

459
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,950
we can get the actual u r l

460
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,559
we can actually username

461
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,710
and we can actually get a password

462
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,850
now this is kind of a ski in the fall
function the user comes up

463
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,390
his name to be smith if any case the
device it validates seems to help that

464
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,760
knowledge he does a ski in the file
function

465
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,690
it's actually get a sport dislocation in
species credentials to carry out that

466
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,720
function

467
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,800
uh... probably out of

468
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,750
twenty or thirty companies that i've
actually hold this information from

469
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,100
other systems

470
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,100
i'd say probably about twenty twenty
percent fifteen to twenty percent of

471
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,690
time

472
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,240
actually find more than just

473
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,980
usernames in at email addresses i
actually fine

474
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,310
some form of password be in support of
this amateurs

475
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,850
so that we get into uh...

476
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,520
the h_p_ office ki and and this is a
interesting forceful browser like i said

477
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,750
these devices are used in a lot of
offices

478
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,830
uh... the cool thing is you can like
find about fifty or sixty he's internet

479
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,460
uh... in several years ago

480
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,980
a reporter

481
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,360
it was last year

482
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,460
in reporter actually reported uh... one
internet reporters

483
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,350
as yet one of these we found out that
you could trigger the ski and dad

484
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,490
remotely homies place

485
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,210
so if this device is on the internet

486
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:23,040
you expose the internet bcd leave on the
stand it's potentially accessible

487
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,150
indian first thing he said what you need
to secure these printers

488
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,680
protect that

489
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,230
or portable format for you

490
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,529
do you have one of these things out
there you have it secure

491
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:34,149
as in your work

492
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:41,149
believe anything on the stand

493
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,380
so could come over here too

494
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,920
and come down to the web application
websphere but right

495
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,550
trigger websphere

496
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,370
it prompts us uh... in this case here

497
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,300
it doesn't have the page equal function
it's at the really you are up to it

498
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,399
properly secured this page at least up

499
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,360
this point that doesn't mean that in
some other strip off

500
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,080
but i haven't found it

501
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,750
so we get to this point right here

502
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:12,810
so have

503
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,550
says two operations

504
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,250
there was richard you had to make this
quarry to the printer

505
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,050
uh... off that page

506
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,350
in a bring back the server status code

507
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,220
one sex therapist can come up

508
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,980
there was a post operation you had to do
that turned out that

509
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,150
you really don't need to do the post
operation you can just pass it as a

510
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,380
standard

511
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:41,380
so if we go ahead and prepare this

512
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:08,410
out of the support

513
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,620
so if you have one of these uh...

514
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,750
just remember that it's not secure

515
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,340
there's no way to properly secure that
ski in bed

516
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,630
i find he's a lot of corporate offices

517
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,030
and it's amazing things you may find on
the stand that mostly it's not work

518
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,300
related it usually personal related

519
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,630
uh... it's really comment

520
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,920
someone you know it's uh... medical
stuff the need to file works stephanie

521
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,800
to file it worker with their insurance
company seems to be the common thing up

522
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,650
fun a lot insurance papers being stored
in these things

523
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,310
so up but all we really spread out

524
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,170
actually

525
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,180
has the module build into its army

526
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:51,180
doing this so

527
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,440
okay the nest attack we want to talk
about is a pass back to cactus is kind

528
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,610
of a new approach

529
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,080
this was uh... actually completely found
about a month ago

530
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,120
one of the guys that would work in the
uh... security gate and said hey there

531
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,340
are some ubuntu right goes on the
internal network on that

532
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,460
he set up a tunnel for may not come into
that company

533
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,940
and starter plan with these printers

534
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,999
the whole idea of the past back to texas

535
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:21,240
tricking the printer into passing data
that means that he would expect

536
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,500
pastu some other service

537
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,530
in this case here were doing with the
help that setting so if you go into the

538
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,130
right to help that screens

539
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,790
and uh... you click on

540
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,920
and this case here they have one called
company director it set up and held that

541
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,460
uh... but you can have up to five days
so

542
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,660
we click on the aesthetic takes us over
to various configurations hot that we

543
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,800
can expand that absorb see it

544
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,710
so here we have the server name we have
a search based typical al that port

545
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,390
number

546
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,500
as a self off welcome once again here's
issues

547
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,020
as a so on

548
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,070
uh... pathetic ation on usernames help
that admin so it has turned out of

549
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,590
all right

550
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,900
held that server

551
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,820
and then we have a thing called password
change in supply

552
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,770
so if we click on this we did not

553
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,330
we have the ability to change the
password

554
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,100
that uses this indicator l pat but
that's not what we want

555
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,880
one thing were actors at the bottom the
screen turns out they have taken catch

556
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,090
test

557
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,290
what it does is the by click this button

558
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,340
the right to a printer will go to the
help that server

559
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,260
an open ticket to el dev server and
basically have a response back said hey

560
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,610
this

561
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,080
connections do it

562
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,780
so let's play with it

563
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,370
let's go ahead and changed the i_p_o_
address on that configuration

564
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,070
this test the button

565
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,570
it comes back and connects the us we
have a listener

566
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,970
the password is prayer one eight seven
so now we have full access to the held

567
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,930
at server with

568
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,180
held that that man

569
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,549
in their environment

570
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,210
chin easily by tricking the cool thing
about this is we're not

571
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,680
complete estimate

572
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,710
it turns out that uh...

573
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,160
come back here real quick

574
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,059
all the pieces a didi here

575
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:12,290
except for the password

576
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,690
are actually sit in the post operation

577
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,320
so uh... the testing that i need to do
in assessment here get limited access to

578
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,580
the devices

579
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,280
so wait for another series of writers to
get access to arrive a friend works of

580
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,370
the company's was we give these to me

581
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,290
i fear a rise that

582
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,119
if we pass this data

583
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,500
in new york

584
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,520
are in the post operation

585
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,730
that's the way we could be the pattaya

586
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,400
server-side p address

587
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,270
we don't miss a rapid changes on the
printer

588
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,200
now way instead of making modifications
to advice

589
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,100
triggered

590
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,620
we just send it to the device at a post
operation

591
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,739
and it'll just make

592
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:52,700
the correlation with the right

593
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,620
password and send it back to us

594
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,130
that some tests in this left to be done
and i have a strong feeling that's going

595
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:04,289
to be the case

596
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:07,520
okay the next four or talk about his
extracting

597
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,810
uh... information from backup data

598
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,320
uh... number multifunction printers
provide a method for doing backup for

599
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,170
cloning operations

600
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,710
uh... these functions uh... provided and
that method to quickly deployed multiple

601
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,730
systems within the organization as i
mentioned earlier

602
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,889
i have a hundred printers to deploy

603
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,980
do you really want to go two hundred
printers and configure and um... you cut

604
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,900
a clone or some kind of backup

605
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,150
you deploy that to the other printers

606
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:38,310
uh... and uh... xerox has built-in
functionality specifically for tim

607
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,050
this case where to look at a cannon and
we're gonna look at it zero so the first

608
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,990
one were to look at it can and

609
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,620
kind of an older one it's the image
order thirty thirty

610
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,860
they have several different things you
can back up that address books that we

611
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,980
know that data possibly an address books

612
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,639
uh... fourteen settings additional
functions

613
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:02,010
additional functions of the ones that
should contain uh... held that settings

614
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,330
of their core settings within the system

615
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,820
so if we click on that week

616
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,820
we come over ditional functions in these
are all the

617
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,400
the capabilities that we perform the
additional functions

618
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,570
sofa click

619
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,410
actual uh... export it'll export a
backup of the configuration

620
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,679
if you use this

621
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,640
the patient is very slow

622
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,100
iran's soul gosh takes five ten fifteen
minutes based on how much configurations

623
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,500
mcdonnell device

624
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,150
it'll generate a file called user mod

625
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,169
dot you andy

626
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:35,370
this is stored at the root of the u r l

627
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,550
so

628
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,239
if someone's wanted in the past

629
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,970
you can forceful browser

630
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,270
pull it off the system

631
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,640
and uh... the

632
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,820
this is not a asked the file it's
actually datafile

633
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,629
the cranes all kinds of stuff in it but
there's some have skied stranded at yeah

634
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:54,350
net

635
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,710
silver explode that up you can see in
the street data

636
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,870
the username and password or in plain
text

637
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,750
so in this particular devices you're
able to pull

638
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,330
uh... that core information out from a
back up

639
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,180
of the device

640
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:18,460
the next we want to talk about his xerox

641
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,340
in the xerox here uh... obviously it's a
cloning function to click on the cloning

642
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,509
functioning see all the features that
are available there

643
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,570
and you basically clicks one

644
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,360
and what it'll do is have a crater fall
called cloning dot d l m

645
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,159
of the deal and as they are

646
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,160
see if we got a picture

647
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,900
uh... that's also store at the root of
some devices uh... some xerox devices

648
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,420
and if it's been raymond run in the past
you can't force for browsing gain access

649
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,309
to that file two

650
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:51,180
some of the newer ones uh... also uh...
put timestamp in front of cloning so you

651
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,440
can't do that

652
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,880
but still if you get access you to run
your own cloning file you can pull the

653
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,919
information down so let's go ahead and
actually look

654
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,919
at these cloning faust is this is
important

655
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,160
got two examples to look at here

656
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,020
so if we can't cloning file

657
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,980
uh... you can see that it's really no
readable data typically in the cloning

658
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,570
file

659
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,470
but there is some readable dated

660
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,450
better of the cloning file

661
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,300
and it's the structured better that's
been put on their by sierra arcs

662
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,150
uh... i just doing some research and
searching around and i found a norwegian

663
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,259
website work up a lease tax showed up

664
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,190
they don't know

665
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,730
at this site was always worked for
sidenote delivers

666
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,150
i found a good converter and convert it
from work work

667
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,230
indicates some interesting information
at your

668
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:00,020
it generally came out and said it would
be exhilarating fully in that region in

669
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,080
the country

670
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,149
and he said gee

671
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,360
basically at that

672
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
this is a

673
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,280
custom phorbol

674
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,340
compressed phorbol followed custom
hetero

675
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,050
so with syria's you with the better off
and should be able

676
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:20,050
on par

677
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,900
andy's enough were able to extract the
data out of this file

678
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,559
the cool thing is is uh...

679
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,690
they'd use the same cloning functions

680
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,820
anyone's interested

681
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,790
actual far more great insular vice

682
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,490
so you can get all the data

683
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,329
so-called forward arrests in here

684
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,029
happens to be in the data segment

685
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:19,029
uh... it's a c achi klein

686
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:26,919
so you see basically everything in these
files is generally plaintext

687
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:34,999
all the different settings and uh...
post on have new passwords that they're

688
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:37,349
not

689
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:42,299
uh... here we go on for a city p with
password open

690
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:45,990
of would come down here here's the cold
air police set up with what's up in the

691
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,889
past work with no

692
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:52,089
this isn't your typical cloning files

693
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,909
uh... of better uh...

694
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,749
devices that are out

695
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:57,669
a couple years old

696
00:34:57,669 --> 00:35:02,409
they've actually done some attempts to
actually secure this

697
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:05,669
and i'll show you what that looks like
uh... we haven't cracked it yet but we

698
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:06,230
were

699
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,900
headley working on figured out what

700
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,329
the mechanisms being used here

701
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:13,629
let's go ahead

702
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:20,629
goto example too so that we could show
that

703
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:14,369
there's someone structural audience for
information

704
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:17,189
even if you don't get the passwords you
can see that all that password happens

705
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:18,959
to be

706
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,280
thirty-two character

707
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,429
uh... hex

708
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,690
which which makes us quickly think that
is

709
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,869
possibly a ash

710
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,389
uh... truth is that this is a clothing
function remember thus far as the

711
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:31,689
transfer to weiss's

712
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,899
for that device to be able to indicate
to you

713
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:38,779
whatever they held that this is going to
have to have a plain text of the old do

714
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,819
that

715
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:41,160
action is not

716
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,239
reversible

717
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,479
so it can typically the ash

718
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:47,879
so we know what some form uh... of
cryptic

719
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:50,199
not sure why

720
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,949
the the the cool thing is is

721
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:53,700
others like to have all that

722
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,200
programs that are used

723
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,299
true the clown

724
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:57,519
operation

725
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,669
so hopefully we can figure out what that
is and we also know a lot of these

726
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:01,439
devices

727
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,649
who accuse

728
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:05,650
fingers databases uh... when the
printers uh...

729
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,890
within the operates

730
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,589
sport all this deductible val

731
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:11,140
so is it being cryptic

732
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,840
inside the databases

733
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,839
says a lot of key things we need to
figure out yet

734
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,250
unfortunately yet

735
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,640
this printer that this came off of like
twenty thousand dollar program

736
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,370
northwardly

737
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,629
oneself

738
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:27,329
so it's a very short burst of of
knowledge that we gather

739
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:30,420
uh... and it's costly building on the
big picture hopefully

740
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,849
we will get to that point

741
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:33,720
where they're there

742
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,009
that the light goes or that we know
exactly what's taking place here

743
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:39,469
at that point will probably

744
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:44,479
uh... release that information as part
of park school

745
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:47,540
uh... early this year really release a
tool called preta

746
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,659
uh... prayer does latin for

747
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:52,439
of plunder fees

748
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:55,010
and that's what the told us this whole
goal is to

749
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,549
wonder you're printers for possible
usable information

750
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:01,929
uh... my team uses this on a regular
basis were always costly trying to

751
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:06,079
improve it make it better

752
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,629
in it contains a per module so it looks
for printers that that is checked

753
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:12,689
default password for a couple network
appliances

754
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:15,679
the ultimate goal is to incorporate also
uh...

755
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,289
various uh... network appliances also
because they they suffer some more

756
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:21,029
problems

757
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:22,249
regularly find uh...

758
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:25,129
network appliances with default
passwords on on

759
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:29,409
uh... cameras and stuff like that a lot
of spices integrate with other systems

760
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:32,160
at a minimum essendon he is a standard
uh...

761
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,239
integration uh... one gauge meant

762
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,920
gained access s_ and p_ string with the
same one that the reason why were far

763
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,749
walls and

764
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,429
and sister robert so

765
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:42,839
we quickly gain access to all that stuff

766
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,680
uh... because of a camera

767
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,489
uh... that was configured with recipe

768
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:50,189
the tool is

769
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:54,689
or or uh... i'll be honest with the
tortoise

770
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:55,809
it's not really buddy

771
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,259
uh... treatment

772
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:01,799
uh... higher i wrote the code of the
code is in my opinion i kept it very

773
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:03,149
simplistic

774
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:04,699
there are some coating

775
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:08,839
methods that i used or structure methods
they use to build this

776
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:11,829
that may be a little strange to some
people uh...

777
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:12,869
but when i was

778
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:16,319
researching how to module writes this
whole thing

779
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:20,819
ideas for comfortable going in this
direction verses units pearl

780
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:24,219
do the same thing three hundred sixty
five different ways

781
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:27,119
and this has happened to be one of the
three rd sixty five different ways still

782
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,339
with us

783
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:32,789
and goal as a criticism plus the tool

784
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:36,999
uh... and generally that always made up
before general parts you have uh...

785
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:41,579
prayer uh... p l which is the dispatcher
of the way the dispatcher works itchy

786
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,359
feet of the target list

787
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,849
of eyepiece of printer devices

788
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,459
and what it'll do is it'll crawl through
those i_p_ addresses

789
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,949
korean title page

790
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:53,729
and the server type

791
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:57,069
so we have a file called data file in
the data files you can see we have uh...

792
00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:00,499
switch a list um... number in on the
left hand side

793
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:04,319
and then we have the next tag area is
actually the title page

794
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,929
the next ten year is the server type

795
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:10,879
we find out that uh... fairly reliable
fingerprinting methanol on these type of

796
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:13,319
or on boasted that its system because

797
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:16,229
you know they want to tell you what
their product this

798
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:19,039
what model number it is and all that
type of stuff

799
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:21,039
within that key information

800
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:26,309
and in that last part is actually
modules that have been written to do

801
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:29,159
information gathering and webpage
gathering

802
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,149
parsi all that type of stuff

803
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:35,939
so so the pre-op will will be is the
target list

804
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:39,329
uh... you know compared to the data file
it if it gets a match it'll run the

805
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:40,959
modules

806
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:45,589
and that simply how it works

807
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,959
so at present i think there's

808
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:51,779
i could get this wrong because there's
two different versions of the release

809
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:54,279
version internal versions

810
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,299
been released yet

811
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:57,469
but i think there's like twenty eight
different

812
00:40:57,469 --> 00:40:59,249
variations of modules

813
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:03,099
now uh... when i did when i put this
thing together because the fact that as

814
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,189
obsessed mention here i gain access to
your xerox

815
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:10,039
it may not see that model infer three
four five months

816
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,819
uh... and i might find annexing gave
middle model very similar

817
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:15,230
but the quarry method

818
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,989
in the page maybe slightly different

819
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,169
plaintiff creating at least different
module

820
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:22,839
and the purpose of that was because
there's no way to go back

821
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,679
retest the older system

822
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:29,429
so if i make changes to to incorporate
multiple variations

823
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:33,479
uh... my fear was i would step on my
cell clark myself the goal is once we

824
00:41:33,479 --> 00:41:34,780
get this thing big enough

825
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,609
and get a big enough test days for
people playing around with it

826
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:41,739
will be able to clap solarz number these
into modules that

827
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:45,680
that you know poles the uh... address
book it calls this of course that from

828
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,969
the printer and covers i have to for

829
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:51,829
variations of the canon printer versus
havent

830
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,709
four five different uh... modulus uh...

831
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,520
to actually be the same thing that we
would

832
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,069
would step on ourselves

833
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:03,819
uh... we're also looking at my grading
over to ruby

834
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:07,389
we'd we got a couple base rebbe versions
that have been written

835
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:10,579
but we haven't gone through that have
been tested and then all the variations

836
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:11,329
and stuff

837
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,309
the ultimate goal is that we get the
same structure of working

838
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:17,159
successfully on a large number of
systems

839
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,019
uh... medicaid

840
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:21,949
then should be incorporated the mets
point

841
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:24,509
that with that will be open to all

842
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:28,189
uh... we're also working on h p_n_c_
rock secret you methods

843
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:29,609
that the using crip certain

844
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:34,690
backup data files as i showed earlier

845
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,519
generally uh...

846
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:39,650
i work for a purpose netware actually
hiring so if anyone's interesting

847
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,669
getting a job that investor we're
looking for a developer

848
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:44,999
doesn't have to know contestant

849
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:48,479
teaching the contest but we're looking
for developer so if you're a since she

850
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,999
resonated jobs at food first dot net

851
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:52,429
maybe later this year

852
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:53,240
and up

853
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,949
that's pretty much presentation do we
have any questions

854
00:42:57,949 --> 00:43:03,759
i'll come on on the silences

855
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:05,249
people playing with the tool

856
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:09,309
play with a tall right modules i mean a
really really simplistic uh... perl

857
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:12,539
modules you have scrabble web page at
parsons date is generally what it's

858
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:13,309
doing

859
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:16,249
work that the vice actually export
something you just trigger that

860
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:19,469
exporting gather the data so you can
easily look at these models and create

861
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:20,629
new ones

862
00:43:20,629 --> 00:43:22,279
tell us what the progress

863
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:25,109
work that generates air messages or
brings back

864
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:26,279
garbage

865
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:30,519
you know sometimes it's a if it's an air
condition we haven't seen before

866
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:31,589
occurred

867
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:34,839
you may end up with you know a whole
page of html when it should have just

868
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:35,799
said

869
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:37,619
in the log file you know

870
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,549
password something like that so those
type of things because

871
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:43,970
anyone has any ten fifteen twenty or
thirty thousand dollar printers they

872
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,069
want to give me

873
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:49,809
uh... that would come in handy which is
unlikely

874
00:43:49,809 --> 00:43:56,809
your questions yet

875
00:43:58,879 --> 00:44:03,389
in my opinion i think xeroxes naked

876
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:05,910
since i started this project uh...

877
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,789
i started at last year

878
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:13,749
i was actually before shinu i did ah...
interview with m_i_t_ uh...

879
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:15,009
tech review

880
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:19,730
that was picked up by msnbc's since then
i've done to two interviews with

881
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,249
printer industry trade magazines

882
00:44:23,249 --> 00:44:26,069
so so the goal weight is is you know

883
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:27,939
i would get everyone

884
00:44:27,939 --> 00:44:31,439
can i say ones better than the other

885
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:33,429
you know if they have catches

886
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:35,029
r_u_ installing them

887
00:44:35,029 --> 00:44:38,389
that's the question as you know they are
really some patches

888
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:40,700
to sheila contacted me after schmidt

889
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,919
and said that they were

890
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:43,209
they had a patch

891
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:45,520
uh... they're supposed to follow up a
phone call would take that

892
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,929
and so i'm not sure there they thanked
me

893
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:50,739
that coalition of but

894
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:53,599
uh... so burst potentially a patch out
there

895
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,730
uh... for that

896
00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:01,730
security bypass here

897
00:45:03,979 --> 00:45:06,829
all you talking with the card access
system all of them

898
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:11,129
i have not had a chance to experience as
i see those are allot times being used

899
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:15,089
in military government installations now
on a large scale

900
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:18,089
but unfortunately i haven't done
assessments which gave me access to this

901
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:20,260
type of things by maybe

902
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,850
fascinating you know what would the
security implications be home at the

903
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,309
console in that the vice and reporter
finicky with a car

904
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:31,519
but if i can go into the web interface
in reputed ask for what we solved

905
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,179
uh... street that and we all went well
with only a look at the web interface of

906
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:40,259
partners other resources are other
interfaces on these printers

907
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:42,909
i know they run as a staging telnet

908
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:47,079
obscene and lease large systems says the
rocks and uh...

909
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:51,569
can enlarge systems are running actually
asano s on a car pc

910
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:58,569
so it's a full-blown operating system

911
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:03,509
for several several different things

912
00:46:03,509 --> 00:46:07,239
do pay attention to patch management
flights because

913
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:10,729
most of the stuff i shared with key and
it doesn't work on all the places so

914
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:11,609
might

915
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:13,079
surmise is that

916
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,110
there's a patch for

917
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,609
organ version out there

918
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:19,239
uh... the other thing is changed default
passwords or set a password make it a

919
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,099
real passport no

920
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:25,079
something this issue with campus name
just does

921
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:28,719
of the other thing is is look at what
the printers being used for

922
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,189
we're talking about the primer on the
payroll system

923
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:32,690
why is that accessible white

924
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,669
some shmoe they just plugged in here
network

925
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:37,380
wise in that price elated

926
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,829
only access to those type of resources

927
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:43,229
so if you do that you set the password
it'll pass management

928
00:46:43,229 --> 00:46:44,569
and set the pro rob

929
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:47,769
for what it's going to be used for

930
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:54,769
i think you you can actually secure so
fairly well

931
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:08,739
to me that would be lovro overkill

932
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:09,719
uh... i i think

933
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:13,659
if i can by plant might bug on your
network cannot plugin

934
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:17,459
but there's probably about three hundred
of the ways i continue from left

935
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,399
versus using purposes just one of

936
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:21,289
uh... this is

937
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:24,609
actually when we do this on the gauge
minutes what we do the last day

938
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:29,299
usually the first day we have your
demanded

939
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:31,829
i don't think there's a case that has
been

940
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:38,829
any other questions

941
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:44,400
yet you want to do like appears or uh...
for

942
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,999
approxi capture

943
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:49,699
of of a transaction of usable data clean
the data please

944
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:52,849
yet don't don't send me your passwords

945
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:58,089
and and don't do that again somebody
your legally do not have access to

946
00:47:58,089 --> 00:48:05,089
i want that dated the event

947
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:09,799
at the speaker all decade ask the
question earlier a similar question him

948
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:14,909
and i'd mention that xerox in my opinion
seems to have a a focus in that area

949
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:18,079
but but we still have to have that users
educated

950
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,769
you know they could build all these
features into a predictor never utilized

951
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:22,320
by the end users were

952
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,639
what's the point

953
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:26,460
if i can gain access and i can make mods
to your

954
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,599
to your printer

955
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,079
or do you know if i can gain access like
this too

956
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,359
what's the next step i pretty much
pointy thing off the hard drives in some

957
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,209
cases and and all that stuff

958
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:38,789
xerox to consequences are due oldest
decryption

959
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:40,669
and all kinds of crazy things

960
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:43,779
uh... so i think they're doing the right
thing to move in the right way

961
00:48:43,779 --> 00:48:47,709
and open the ways that i create will get
the other vendors a move in the right

962
00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:54,219
direction

963
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:55,979
uh... i'm actually

964
00:48:55,979 --> 00:48:59,649
right i'm i'd work as a assistant
engineer contest

965
00:48:59,649 --> 00:49:00,510
so you know

966
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:07,510
they they pay me to come on their site
incest their security

967
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:11,029
unity kitty

968
00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:12,530
why would they say for xoxoxo

969
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,430
now you definitely don't want to run
uh... you don't wanna run in the scanner

970
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,979
again separately came as a scanner

971
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:21,499
that those of you run as a skinner get
something objects all over south starts

972
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:22,729
flashing

973
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:26,309
and most of printers of diversity run as
a scanner against planners they're

974
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:29,569
actually can start spewing hundreds of
pages and locked up

975
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:30,879
that's a guarantee

976
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,439
uh... because remember when you get port
ninety one hundred four ninety one

977
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,369
hundred just takes whatever hits a
prints

978
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:40,259
so if neces feeds a garbage is going to
try to print and and and and color

979
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:47,259
criticize

980
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:52,959
yet but this is the nile service

981
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:54,180
there there's a lot of

982
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,250
open period here for bad things that can
be done

983
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,819
because you know what a lot of devices
on i'm not saying which ones and how

984
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:01,799
many

985
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,519
but the actual

986
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:05,159
uh... for more upgrade

987
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:08,500
you can just sit at the ninety one
hundred internal processes

988
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,970
firmware upgrade sir

989
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:13,579
crisis

990
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:17,829
because if you if you if you look if you
look at a lot of firmware upgrades

991
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:19,939
their actual up

992
00:50:19,939 --> 00:50:22,349
fall framed up in pcl

993
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:29,349
uh... pcl jobs

994
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:37,409
yeah mattimoe stumbled this

995
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,699
print it's uh... it's a potential
attacked vector

996
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:42,030
uh... but the thing is is

997
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:44,530
on sure i will never convince anyone to
love me

998
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,639
test this on the twenty thousand dollars
print

999
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:51,609
nor what i try to

1000
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:58,609
on bacteria

1001
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:01,739
you know i dont

1002
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:04,800
not yet i did some experimenting on
these devices

1003
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,749
uh... and some of the variations of the
office jets of some of the other models

1004
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:10,959
you can actually hit the device

1005
00:51:10,959 --> 00:51:12,999
remotely across the internet

1006
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:15,010
and go to the configuration page

1007
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:15,960
and checked the

1008
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,760
wireless

1009
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,269
it'll actually pick up all the wireless
in that area

1010
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:21,189
so if you get past the device

1011
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:24,599
you know i've i've always theorize
viking check to a device

1012
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,699
somewhere close to me on someone's
network

1013
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:31,640
or what's a potential getting it connect
back to me what's physically connected

1014
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,299
to the network

1015
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,990
is there any way to carry out that there
is that there's always a possibility

1016
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:42,239
i know some of the premier companies
will not allow the wireless

1017
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:44,769
ports to be up say on

1018
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:51,769
and that's how we try to fix that but
not all of

1019
00:51:56,449 --> 00:52:03,449
well that again to say that a lot of

1020
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:11,939
no i thought that the firmware the from
where i have not done yet uh... i

1021
00:52:11,939 --> 00:52:14,729
haven't played around with an injection
attacks like that

1022
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:18,599
so far we we we have a lot of things one
that the big list of nasty things i want

1023
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,479
to do in life

1024
00:52:20,479 --> 00:52:23,849
and are right now we're just trying to
get our way through all the web

1025
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,169
interface stuff

1026
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:26,769
you know it's like the whole

1027
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,609
everything's laid out to me and once
once i get to the point where i have

1028
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:34,479
that under my belt mandel yet we're
gonna move on some other cool

1029
00:52:34,479 --> 00:52:36,549
capabilities uh... all the way

1030
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:40,079
and i said that and i've had
brainstorming sessions with with people

1031
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,709
about

1032
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:45,199
uh... attacks with uh... firmware
upgrades that would actually vote on

1033
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:49,029
these high-end systems

1034
00:52:49,029 --> 00:52:52,789
you know exploit code tunneling through
scanning cody triggered through the web

1035
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:54,009
interface

1036
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:57,150
uh... so we sat down and brain storm
thought about that so there's a lot of

1037
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,179
tax after cessation these printers

1038
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:01,979
uh... that i've not done yet

1039
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:04,959
i think we're pretty much out of time

1040
