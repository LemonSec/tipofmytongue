initials

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,550
uh... whatever talk let's say it is a
little bit about malware

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,530
and how you can deal identification
classification of malware

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,750
using yarra

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,189
uh... specifically with python they have
a lot of bindings

10
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:32,340
uh... with other

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,500
languages in eight dash for whatever you
need but specifically

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,860
uh... for use in the city of python

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,360
oliver about myself

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
i went to alrighty i graduate no six

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,560
and said i was a member of computer
science us was there

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,330
there's a few of us here

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,190
contrary i worked as an adverse excited
just hang in there for a government

18
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,900
contractor

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,970
won't go any further into that

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,619
uh... celia said our retirement now
where

21
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,140
yarrow icon

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,940
declassification staff i have some demos
for you to show you how you can use

23
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,590
papon to do some analysis on

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,540
certain pieces of

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,660
testify little concern now after the
sake of argument

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,440
and then look cute you session if any

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,470
wants to crack cocaine about any talked
about

28
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,840
malware

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,550
sweet sound of a bitch

30
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,470
we sing our net ton of different file
taxes

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,719
l_p_d_ hats

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,150
sweat files

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,370
when there is executed walls you have
where documents excel files rich text

34
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,350
and the list goes on and on these are
some of the major types that you'll see

35
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,300
now where

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,240
coming into your network

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,990
embedded in these files

38
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,860
some of the ways you get these
acquisitions coming through our

39
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,140
downloads off the internet now this
doesn't necessarily mean

40
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,080
someone's going to a web page and
downloading a file this can be cured

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,430
bittorrent

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,960
hotmail drop boxes been pretty popularly
whatever way someone actually attempts

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,679
to

44
00:01:58,679 --> 00:01:59,750
initially

45
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,130
a download onto the computer some type
of file

46
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,540
uh... compromise website content if i
papa website i can easily replaced any

47
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,939
file i want on there with malicious
content of my shooting

48
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,319
and i don't necessarily have to make
them the same father you've seen i could

49
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,780
have a image on their poori

50
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,649
pbf on there that looks like a pbf earn
image

51
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:23,619
i want to sign a machine is actually
something completely different

52
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,499
another way to get it is through email

53
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:29,389
phishing scams all over the place emails
pertaining to be your banking you click

54
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,259
on the link it looks like your bank

55
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,279
really isn't

56
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:35,599
you just look at the web pages now
malicious and the content on your

57
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,869
machine

58
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:40,099
attachments are rampant all over the
place

59
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,349
uh... i'm very very paranoid

60
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,409
with attachments now

61
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:47,189
and the attachment that comes in if you
don't know who the person and you

62
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:49,819
haven't validated for that email came
from them

63
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:55,939
you don't necessarily know that that
attachment is what it says it is

64
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,599
the saddest scenario where you've been
infiltrated

65
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,079
most of the time you don't know this has
happened and you're going about your day

66
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:06,989
today and so is somebody else on your
network and you don't know about it

67
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,629
uh... note if you saying you don't know
how biggest scale

68
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,559
infestation has become you know in the
first game it is a box or to or ten

69
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:19,459
overtime that person seating themselves
in a move laterally and they're gonna

70
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,540
choirs much based on your network as
they can to rid themselves that way if

71
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,229
they do you have an issue aware you find
that machine you take it off the network

72
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:31,619
they still have another box that they
can get internet work with or used to

73
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,459
acquire information

74
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,940
and then we move on to disobey easel how
deeply rooted are they what do they know

75
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,890
how do we know it

76
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,790
how deeply rooted are they and all the
systems how much access to the after all

77
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,189
the things you wanna

78
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,709
key people out

79
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,869
uh... for the sake of right lets say
sunday

80
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:49,529
after you've been rocked

81
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,509
you see something that seems a little
bit confusing siege might try and find

82
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,319
out what it is

83
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,189
everyone should be very familiar

84
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:59,499
ridiculous cycle

85
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,159
the theory being that

86
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,729
you're prepared this

87
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:04,249
will save you from everything

88
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:08,680
and really all that means is that's how
bad you dont that's the part that you

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,029
set so when you fail you can see how
little you actually done to protect

90
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:13,099
yourself

91
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,029
so ones up happening is you come into
response and now everyone's all worried

92
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,139
this is where management starts flipping
out

93
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,650
all the people start asking questions no
one knows the answers people start

94
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,690
trying to do things you think you're
going to help and they're really just

95
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,790
kind of stumbling through because they
weren't actually prepared they can have

96
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,600
a plan

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,710
to get through that really long response
time and then you move into recovery

98
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,250
will hardly get them off the network
highly cleaner network would reduce from

99
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,389
here

100
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,520
stop taxes change password yadda yadda

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,349
and then you run for your mitigation
steps you can get back into your

102
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:47,379
preparing us for what can we do to
better protect ourselves and next on

103
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,810
this doesn't happen

104
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,409
in fortunate thing is

105
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,729
you start to get tunnel vision and now
when you're mitigation steps are so we

106
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,929
really focused on what just happened and
not about the bigger picture

107
00:04:57,929 --> 00:05:01,240
so now you're safe from that one
specific incident

108
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,369
which is probably never going to be used
on you again because it was our teased

109
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,240
the tricks that

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,379
bias that measure wants answers and this
is pretty much the response you get

111
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,399
right away

112
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,719
no one has any idea what's going on and
no one has its answers because no one's

113
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:18,099
have the time to go through and you can
alesis

114
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:20,469
so what do you do

115
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:23,879
you start going through all these random
things that you take a minute hope

116
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,809
but they're probably not and you're
probably doing them in the wrong order

117
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:31,449
taking post-op and that word making
everyone in the company to surpass rich

118
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,729
changing every pastor for every web
service you have every administrative

119
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,330
account you have

120
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,790
trying to you know goes through anything
you can figure out whether it's you know

121
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,949
idea systems and iris logs

122
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,979
network traffic analysis where you get
banged up just to make it seem like

123
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,180
you're doing something that makes you
feel useful

124
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,599
usually doesn't happen

125
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,450
most important step it everyone usually
sketches

126
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,599
acquiring but now where he can analyze

127
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:03,180
you better rocked by a piece of software
and you don't want to know what it did

128
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,770
your site here trying to go through and
you all the steps to clear your network

129
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,070
to make it securely did actually find
out what the market in the first place

130
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,020
if he knew with them our date is much
easier to figure out where on your

131
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,330
network is where i could have gone where
two rooted and how to get rid of it

132
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,030
we get better data mining

133
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,260
to resolve these steps

134
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,259
who is interested in your company

135
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,599
who is interested in that targeted user
that might have gotten that you know

136
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:28,860
with that attachment

137
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,310
these are the types of questions you
want to ask yourself give that person

138
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,580
name

139
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,449
you don't need to have to know it

140
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,770
given in pom pom

141
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,620
on joe only what everyone at home

142
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,129
just give them the names you have an
attached identity

143
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,030
to which just happens

144
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,680
will be trying to do with this malice is
partly analysis steps with the what is

145
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,210
the and forty

146
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,280
where they're trying to do it

147
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,059
when did it come in

148
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,580
where did it come from

149
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:59,020
it wasn't necessarily from and email
survey you expect was approxi

150
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,710
how did it come in through web all these
different question intranet start to get

151
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,189
a scope of the big picture touchy
painting a portrait of his act was going

152
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:07,379
on down

153
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:10,809
wire they after company do you have
secrets to the knows something about

154
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:14,770
your company that you may also know but
you don't want anyone else

155
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,469
and most importantly how does that help
them accomplish that goal

156
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,710
obviously the using this tool for
specific reason

157
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,879
if they've done enough intel
intercompany

158
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,569
they're going to know why they're
sending a specific piece of mallory and

159
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,530
and why they think that's going to work
next year

160
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,080
we do it at all

161
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,280
but in a database

162
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,250
some type of way to correlate that
information to get as you can identify

163
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,259
the trends in commonalities between all
the different pieces of malware that you

164
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,060
see

165
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,680
we'll find out is that you start to see
some trends

166
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,169
he can start to put these pieces an hour
together

167
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,319
agency you know we just saw bob

168
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,809
use that peace in our here and now he's
using his other once again star see

169
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,899
people changing tactics

170
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,620
based on things going around

171
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,259
news that you hear on the internet about

172
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:00,449
people getting attacked other companies
and they say you know what we saw that

173
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,440
recently

174
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,030
that's really and shane geezer lots of
bits of g_a_t_t_ start to share with

175
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,949
each other

176
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,709
and here's around urs

177
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,119
if you don't like how the fantasy of
that

178
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:15,069
you're doing a lot of action here but
would it be really accomplished

179
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:19,029
whereas talk about identifying
classifying them our that you've just

180
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,239
taken samples out

181
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:24,499
what is your idea essentially when you
do is you take

182
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:26,879
heartstrings and tax and

183
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,659
need katie binary file u four mr yaar we
are as india is gonna look for

184
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:35,439
uh... constraints in rules based on that
strained if it finds it's going to make

185
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:39,529
sure that those constraints match before
it takes a positive idea about filing

186
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,680
maternity

187
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,280
and outfits that match as a rule

188
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,720
the output can be whatever you want to
make it and peace on the output you can

189
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,010
then respond accordingly

190
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,580
uh... what a seven atop a python and
this is pretty much how do you do yaar

191
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,850
with python in a nutshell

192
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,110
three lines

193
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,670
uh... you important are up

194
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,520
uses pyaar it's on the our website which
i have the link to be our project at the

195
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,360
end if you want to get it

196
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,740
uh... you compile your signatures

197
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,900
which interesting here is that you don't
necessarily have to have one signature

198
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,439
file you can actually a panda multiple
signature fast to get there and when it

199
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,500
does the compilation of puts it all
together for you know i'm nice rule set

200
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,370
uh... you can

201
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,950
skinny file here done during the file
you can

202
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,350
you something like you are a lead
download web content strained it through

203
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,860
it

204
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,339
um... check memory check processes

205
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,010
thank you know choirs detention center
and you can do analysis on

206
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,090
you consent to do here

207
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,390
and the first step

208
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,270
is to profit

209
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,410
as the old saying goes and i'm sure all
of you know this

210
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,060
it walks like a duck

211
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,660
quacks like a duck

212
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,240
it's most likely be t_h_a_ and sign back
doors keylogger xanax filling your

213
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,640
guests

214
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,020
uh... the d_a_g_a_ is the determined
human adversary

215
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,860
house

216
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,690
the other person on the other hand

217
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,760
that is attempting to get into your
network

218
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,520
a lot of people use the term a_t_t_
they're pretty much interchangeable

219
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,709
some of us like to use t_h_a_ beaches

220
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,080
people don't necessarily need to be
advanced anymore

221
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,770
to get your network

222
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,530
uh... so sublet some identification

223
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,920
i report century why did you want to
take them our and you want to get some

224
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,729
characteristics about that in our
that'll easily

225
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:29,040
be able to identify long-term

226
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,370
the specifics about that content

227
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,020
and we're talking about

228
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,980
what is it touch

229
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,190
what does it do

230
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,850
i'd use the words functional
unfashionable and we're not talking

231
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,840
about high tops or anything from leave
the time

232
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,070
essentially i mean by fashionable is is
it

233
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,140
is it in the now is a something a lot of
people are doing

234
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,910
recently

235
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,950
you know are

236
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,230
abilities pretty much the factual thing
nowadays everyday you're saying

237
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,380
something new coming out for adobe flash
or

238
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,240
a pediatric toby readers mike that the
other

239
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,830
as amoeba fashionable

240
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,589
simply stylists the same concept where
you wanna find out is

241
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,710
who's doing it how often are people
interested in this type of thing

242
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,610
and the little characteristics about
that file

243
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,819
functions that they use function names

244
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:13,440
what the function dies

245
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,150
hype easing domains that might be hard
coded or attempted to reach out to

246
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,880
during processing time hours allotted

247
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,050
uh... specific targets are they looking
for processes on your computer that they

248
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,220
can attach to do

249
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,080
files that they want to expel

250
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,450
memory locations that they're interested
in

251
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,870
all these different things that at the
end of the day results in a successful

252
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,770
education about an hour

253
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,110
as someone can say

254
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,250
an hour ten min executed it did what he
wanted

255
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,880
and the essay now knows everything they
need to know required everything that

256
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,110
they want

257
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,490
after network

258
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,020
awesome classifications i want to
redistribute them cuz i was reading a

259
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,940
research paper i thought these questions
were

260
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,570
really really good

261
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,900
uh... doesn't unknown our instance
belong to the known family or does it

262
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,040
constitute malam our strengths

263
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,009
where century this means is

264
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,070
is this something new have we seen this
an hour before to doing something

265
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,240
different that nothing else is done
which means we need to not give it a

266
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,380
name unclassified of something

267
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,460
forcible onto an existing family that we
can say

268
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,910
this in hours exactly like these are the
ones we've already seen before or the

269
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,280
world the scene

270
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,380
at some point

271
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,960
what behavior features our districts
have reduced their chances of one hour

272
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,130
family from those of others

273
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,750
where we're trying to get here say

274
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,130
always classify this new piece of
malware something different

275
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,080
what are the different characteristics
about that family that makes it

276
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,699
different

277
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:35,769
and might have some commonalities
between the different pieces now where

278
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:38,290
in a different now are strained

279
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,270
given the specific characteristics we
want to classify it as something

280
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,060
different

281
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,860
what we can do their say

282
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,290
based on all those identification and
all those characteristics that we teased

283
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,920
out through analysis

284
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,420
we can start to put into things like
trojans worms expels back doors

285
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,610
keylogger xps

286
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,800
and start to build those families up

287
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,950
but we should be doing is inside of our
class a vacation day debase tagging

288
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,580
these bits of my hour with the string
that they come from

289
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,420
that way long term we can start to see

290
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,140
who is using the stylish and functional
malware who's using something new

291
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,800
where these here it is really force is
something that we need to pay attention

292
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,720
to

293
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
maybe adobe needs to get on the act
because a lot of now is coming out

294
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,170
as all related to strains that are doing
adobe

295
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,970
so we go from there we start to build
yaar signatures

296
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,500
will reduce the generator conditions at

297
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,550
we know based on analysis things that
we're looking for specifically that

298
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,270
makes them our unique

299
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,240
so we can do when they are false
positives

300
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,560
we build the rules

301
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,870
we compile those rules and then we
develop a process to scan the rules

302
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,140
based on those scans and based on the
positive results you can do things like

303
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,220
re triggers trade alerts

304
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,150
for the love of god

305
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,520
if you're gonna trade alerts please tell
people who are gonna be responding to

306
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,460
those alerts

307
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,530
why they respond to those alerts

308
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,509
the worst were speaking to you

309
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:01,040
i send out a severity email with the
busily an exclamation points in the

310
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,819
subject

311
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:04,800
and not tell anyone what they're
supposed to do it once it happens

312
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,380
is now people running around with the
head cut off no idea what to do

313
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,950
when really all they need to do
something very specific

314
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,810
so they're going to create your rule set
and you're going to create these alerts

315
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,790
make sure there's a process behind it

316
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,380
it's very very important

317
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,240
this is a basic rule

318
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,630
on the signature file for your assistant
one rule

319
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,600
percent year defining your metadata and
these are random key value pairs of your

320
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,560
choosing

321
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,950
on you define the kidney defined the
value

322
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,570
you set up your strengths gifts

323
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,650
required

324
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,530
and we're saying here is are we looking
for hex values are we looking for string

325
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,460
data

326
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,640
uh... any specific variables in that one
used to be a comparison

327
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,260
and then we set our condition

328
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,140
do we have to see that string wants to
be up to see a place

329
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,620
ten times fifteen times abdel like
something specific

330
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,130
it doesn't have to have something else
correlated with it

331
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,300
abuse the different types of hate you
can do conditions there's a ton more in

332
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,360
the documentation and i had to pay
pretty sure because some of them are

333
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,410
very expensive and pretty complex but

334
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,210
uh... for the sake of our demo we'll
look at some strings

335
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,550
some values of those trains how often
they come across from the compare

336
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,740
strings

337
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,820
ninety basic filesize restrictions stuff
like that

338
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,899
what sierra

339
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,530
inaction have some

340
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,700
d'amato's here

341
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,830
take a look at

342
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:33,830
i don't know how was it come out but i
will do my best

343
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,890
visit basic signature found a walk
through here

344
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,460
the rule name is this program cannot

345
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,230
famous when they were the p found
windows you see a lot this program not

346
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,500
learn about smoot

347
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,460
the author is mean the data entry to the
signature

348
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,940
uh... i decide i want a type which is
key in a little quick description so i

349
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,490
can see exactly for talking about

350
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,649
and i said it retreat was triggered this
this is not a

351
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,419
a yet sure false brittany this is an
acting tuesday's justice string value

352
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:13,870
this being return

353
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,700
in this case i want to say if the
traders true i want to do something

354
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,860
unique with it

355
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,610
and in this case the string is this
program cannot and the condition is just

356
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,830
the variable which means

357
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,460
festering is there

358
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,160
that's all we're looking for

359
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,700
and this is our python script

360
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,230
important are up

361
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,250
promise kept walking outside parser
stuff because that's just some fluff

362
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,970
uh... this century i'm just passing into
my star function here the signature file

363
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,640
of my choice and the father wants can
against

364
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,730
and this is the meat

365
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,090
retaken the compiled a signature file

366
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,360
and we're on the rules against our
father look for matches

367
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,470
analysis

368
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,130
and i run through a four look here are
the matches because when you run a scan

369
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,550
if there's more than one signature that
gets matched overturns all of them for

370
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,400
you

371
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,669
doesn't return that

372
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:09,010
topic it would hurt everything

373
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,020
on this case i'm looking to see if the
triggers equally true and if it is a

374
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,440
mystery to print out we have a problem

375
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,980
pre-civil past

376
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,660
uh... for any rule that comes in
understanding iterate through the key

377
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,290
value pairs and print it out

378
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,730
nothing

379
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,240
until it doesn't work

380
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,139
so let's take a look at that

381
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:36,500
some of the content

382
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,170
command that you've seen this is really
just the basic

383
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,650
trend aditi

384
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,650
that everyone knows about

385
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,130
i look at that had terry can see very
clearly

386
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,210
they set up a bit

387
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,810
uh... this program cannot be running das
reich

388
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,920
so now with the are you can do a couple
things you can actually search for the

389
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,410
strings this program cannot go you can
use the hex values and search for that

390
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,750
yourself whichever way you feel more
comfortable

391
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,190
hex values are a little more versatile
western values if you actually have

392
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,030
something that seemed to test

393
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,780
much easy things

394
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:17,780
uh... while seva command dot gif

395
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,159
sustained file

396
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:22,200
history in the packet just

397
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,040
it illustrates a point rape you look at
command that get that was needed

398
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,460
something different

399
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,570
just from five u_n_ using the extension
which is always a bad idea

400
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,290
but if you use that

401
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,760
it's not a gift it's just the excusable

402
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,540
uh... chaos at sea dot gif which is
actually are just a picture

403
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,040
and a bunch of string files which are
just uh...

404
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,539
fu barb adsorb like those types of words
just

405
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:53,539
echoed into the spots

406
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,520
silkair's are usage

407
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,490
we're going to use

408
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,130
first signature from this romantic ends

409
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,220
grandaddy exit

410
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,649
and we can see his

411
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:17,140
we actually have a promise trade-off
that

412
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,790
they found that signature as a match in
that file because i found this program

413
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,120
cannot inside of that testing process

414
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,400
on the way you can do here like i said
we're training officer would trigger but

415
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,060
sure you can do whatever you want i'd
gone you can send emails that you can

416
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,179
actually have this do specific things
maybe you have

417
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,129
a bunch of different clients is the one
of on the spot for you

418
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:39,570
submit them using that

419
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,390
whatever you think is necessary to do as
much as you can with this peace in our

420
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,590
for analysis

421
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,320
and just to prove the point

422
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,320
same thing happens with to get by

423
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,039
second

424
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,710
rushing to do the same thing

425
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,760
but i'm looking for that

426
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,690
expat use of this program cannot

427
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,700
you have received here is at seventy e

428
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,560
seven years action to position the parts
are mixed list a li defining that in the

429
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,830
final at offset seventy eight you must
find that string

430
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,970
that means it can be asset fifteen it
can't be at the end of the file it's

431
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,240
gotta be right there 'cause i think that
that is specifically unique

432
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,810
to this file

433
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,930
ospina look for

434
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,830
das

435
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,150
but in here i have tribute was false

436
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,309
because das is it pretty basic string we
have a lot of false positives but don't

437
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:40,779
want it

438
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,070
uh... were off of it very often

439
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,940
outside the files as match dot here
which says if the file size is greater

440
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,470
than two hundred k

441
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,070
then i want to actually

442
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,430
overturn the signature but again because
of so many files coming they could be

443
00:20:54,430 --> 00:21:01,430
overturned a cake we're not gonna
trigger off

444
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,670
that will go back to our vision of
command dat

445
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,570
use apple to hear

446
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,700
and you see that we gather all three of
them had amateur runoff in the first one

447
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,790
and you see that we have a problem it's
not that good for the attitude because

448
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,910
archer receptacles

449
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:23,910
and if you actually look at that

450
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:27,169
you can see that there are three to
thirty seven case we've satisfied that

451
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:34,169
rule two hundred k which is why we

452
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,310
sample three

453
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,110
start getting into some other

454
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,160
string logic here

455
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,549
for this when we're looking at

456
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:45,100
flew barb as a normal

457
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,440
random words

458
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,220
that condition air is pretty logical

459
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,640
we're looking for a a

460
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,000
which is to or the existence of b and c

461
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
so we have to have our investigator or
the existence of the which is horrible

462
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,870
another way of defining something
interesting here is

463
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,790
two of

464
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,759
the variable set which means it doesn't
matter which to just have to be

465
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,890
two of them

466
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,970
another way to do that here because of
the finite variables as s one s two s

467
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,110
three s four

468
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,260
it's due to other astronauts

469
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,190
and i will automatically say anything
that matches that

470
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:29,190
although through for you

471
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,650
okay so we match there

472
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:48,650
we'll take a look at that father

473
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,440
a_b_c_'s just has to manage so it's
uh...

474
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,450
it's matched that dollar aid being
truism

475
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,720
much chains too

476
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,280
ec they got no alert there

477
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,140
that's because

478
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,500
strings to only contains rb variable

479
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,080
and during our condition definition is
an asset d_n_c_

480
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,170
too actually didn't

481
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,920
triveni merrill

482
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,779
strings three should satisfy

483
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:20,970
our other

484
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,080
requirement

485
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,300
d_n_c_ together

486
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,570
and also matched if you look at the
bottom that any two strings are in the

487
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,170
content because we happy and seemed
satisfied are too

488
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:39,170
servidor dot r

489
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,570
just has a role so that

490
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,510
only expecting to see

491
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,490
monolithic

492
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,289
strays five is a little bit complex from
montgomery because the sense makes no

493
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,640
sense at all

494
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,299
uh... but we won't notice and here is
that flu when orgo exist several times

495
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,860
uh... or will exist twice and food just

496
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,330
three times

497
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,320
as expected we match because we saw flu

498
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,510
and horrible

499
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,380
and because two of them were in

500
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:19,380
have more complex signature file here

501
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,620
so here are saying

502
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,060
for any of them the number of
occurrences has to be greater than two

503
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,220
so in this case

504
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,490
through a normal having more than two
workers dot food specific being three as

505
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,390
markers is that you should expect this
one ticket

506
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,900
uh... with this one defines it is

507
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,649
oracle has to be greater than one

508
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:54,130
the string count rule

509
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,070
also asap

510
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,510
uh... be satisfied so that one is not
bought lots of our boat is this will not

511
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,440
trigger

512
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,190
where receipt essentially see how we
cannot build walls that have

513
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,300
requirements on all the rules

514
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,940
what i haven't tested is

515
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,580
defining everyone one file and i'm
compiling the tool file will files

516
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,399
together

517
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:14,539
if you can actually match across will
follow

518
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:17,400
uh... something you have a test yet but
i'm assuming

519
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:24,400
they should be able to do that

520
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,960
you see we've had so

521
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,680
we satisfied that foods there three
times or boser twice which means a

522
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,250
second roles hit and because the first
real hit

523
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:41,250
sectoral now fired up

524
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,770
churning so essentially you're we can do
some

525
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,970
you're on your

526
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,590
you get your signature back if there's a
positive hey you know exactly that files

527
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,810
located because you pass in your script

528
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,330
you can do it every along with that file
if you want a partial further for

529
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,140
anything

530
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,080
your itself is it going to do anything
special you can say if this conditions

531
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,720
met

532
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,580
do some other things and then return
that to pass on this kind of out of the

533
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:23,580
scope

534
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,810
what it will return whatever your robots
in return

535
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,500
where you can sit there and say you know
your account if this matches they go

536
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,970
into this also them about tickets value
and return it for me

537
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,140
at that case you can write that i
thought to do for you the reason as the

538
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,030
cases because your is just about reading
bytes of data and returning

539
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,360
matches our signature fausto

540
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,060
if it's based on memory address for
based on a stream of data are something

541
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,310
like that there's no way of saying that
you can actually go through that stream

542
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,710
and get to a specific variable or orf

543
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,120
helps training you're looking for the
return of that

544
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,130
it's an unknown missus should be handled
by a arts much better handled by

545
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:10,130
developing the code yourself

546
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,560
what i want to help straight years using
regex

547
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,790
uh... to match andy fives

548
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,330
speaking to here's to define your regex
in this case were saying that one has to

549
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,200
start with andy five colon and then
match some type of

550
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,420
uh... and defied

551
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,960
doesn't matter what it is but we wanna
traitor on it because we think mt five

552
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,960
star

553
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:50,380
decide that

554
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,580
you can see that it's right there

555
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,559
we actually have a positive match

556
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,740
and that's because high-tech gandhi five
of that sample singers estimate but

557
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,690
illustrates a point that you cannot
disarray complex things by using regular

558
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,070
expression salamat strands

559
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,550
and that's very powerful because you can
essentially say things can change here

560
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,280
and there but as long as there's a
specific commonality that i think is

561
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,620
unique to this malware

562
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:24,620
i think it on

563
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:46,940
them

564
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,700
that the other saving about the
flexibility is that

565
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,289
you know you do any five matching

566
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:03,510
antique essentially say well this file
is exactly like this dot because i've

567
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,610
seen that mt five before that's this
file as much as well

568
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,320
all i have to do is out of space enough
i'll have completely huge here and be

569
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,440
factored

570
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,100
if you use things like this you can kind
of bypass

571
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,160
little bits and changing code so is
someone's progressing through the

572
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,840
development of a piece of my hour and
they keep sending again

573
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,660
as long as you have specific
commonalities

574
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,540
you've essentially gained at jump

575
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,990
on things like t_v_ and the idea systems
where they require very specific

576
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,370
signatures that

577
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:38,370
you know maybe gets cured because
someone's chance in december

578
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,010
this can be what everyone's eyes your
streaming in

579
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,809
uh... data

580
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:45,350
you can search on whatever you want

581
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,929
plane yeah i i did a bunch of fine
textiles there that the binaries

582
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:57,929
right

583
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,770
and i would never do this but if you
want a pie piece if you don't carry our

584
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,799
furniture

585
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,520
happen like that

586
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,990
so i think or trade are you have this
really great system reconstruct

587
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,930
identified classify malware

588
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,929
acquire that information put it in the
database

589
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,440
and we'll see if you can start matching
them our that's coming in

590
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,380
how do you incorporate that wealth

591
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,430
you can put it on your network and
intercept web downloads

592
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,750
you know someone tries to download
pediatric tiara for see if it hits the

593
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,269
signature if not pass it back to the
user

594
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:48,880
i connect before use u r l leads you can
download file directly

595
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,120
if someone says this website is
malicious discuss some jobs have been at

596
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,160
this real funky stuff

597
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,230
down what it means you are against it
that we're not actually executing the

598
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,179
webpage

599
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:01,409
russia downloading the content and
scanning through to see the tenant your

600
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,350
interest in our signatures

601
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,690
uh... email attachments if you can't go
through change

602
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,499
x you know extract out as attachments
are scanned them

603
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:13,460
see what's inside of a make sure that
all state before the end user can

604
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,840
actually get home

605
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,380
honey pots if anyone uses honey pots and
you actually have an engagement and

606
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,600
someone starts dropping content onto
your systems

607
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,520
calling those files off scanning and
seeing what's going on what type of

608
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,670
picture make

609
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,520
if you have a

610
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,980
robust snuff database restate baat as
he's fifteen twenty pieces a malware

611
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,680
and then you see a new file come in your
system and matches when your signatures

612
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:41,680
good chance bob's back on your network

613
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,179
no so one of the

614
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:01,039
robust reinvent really wanted to put
together as a yaar signature database

615
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,570
like an open-source database

616
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,280
where i can say based on the specific mt
five and file

617
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,610
i found that the signature matches for
it

618
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,150
and that way the community as a whole
can start using those signatures and

619
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:12,969
yarra

620
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:16,119
going down for themselves that we don't
have to do the work for themselves and

621
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,600
by very soon and i'll wear

622
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,149
just let everyone else know was that
they can just pull that signature

623
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:27,149
database down into themselves

624
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,850
so there is a top tomorrow that jerry
pronounced putting on

625
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,450
about an hour and also someone

626
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,100
essentially you do is

627
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,530
injected process halfway through my cock
and while you're going through doing the

628
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,840
analysis the jersey shore you how to do

629
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,529
look for those specific things and
usually the bill closer you get to the

630
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:07,730
specific exploit that they used to
rocket machine that's probably the best

631
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:14,730
place for your signatures and the other
generating

632
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,790
uh... i don't

633
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,190
the rule set themselves a conducive to
bring something like that and sort out

634
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,340
unimpeded take the rule itself and give
it to store and have snark understanding

635
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,549
you'd probably have to do some changes
and and

636
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:33,320
work it into a store model before l
actually

637
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,279
compact but

638
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,529
not to say that you couldn't have the
rule against north and in the art museum

639
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,150
in combination

640
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,440
uh... wanting our always always advocate
is uses many things you possibly can

641
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,029
even if it's redundant

642
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:46,500
to make sure that it triggers

643
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,970
if you want to use

644
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,000
virus scans north yarra

645
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,610
anne other system he can possibly think
of denition chambers i think i mentioned

646
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:59,480
here

647
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,840
denition charity there

648
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,460
um... whatever you can't abuses many
different systems are trying to do this

649
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,990
because if one dozen chances are that
one of the others well

650
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,249
and then you can start to trigger false

651
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:14,159
node is my denition shaver castings
m_i_t_ are signatures don't

652
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,099
what can i do to enhance my signatures
to compensate for that or maybe i can go

653
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,419
back to our

654
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:22,000
appliance vendor and say look

655
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,639
i had this thing over here that's in all
the time in your sister's completely

656
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,559
missing a need to enhance your stuff

657
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,560
and that's really how the collaborative
system and community

658
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,140
will raise the bar so that we can start
catching things are often and other

659
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,569
systems artists

660
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:37,979
not catching up

661
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:41,829
i said oh four mt five the files not
really get because each and one

662
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,389
little character in an entirely
factories and

663
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,779
and your spirit

664
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:49,529
jars also free

665
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:51,979
you know it takes a little bit of
development time before you can actually

666
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:55,509
use it but uh... it's it's free to slap
it on a rich and it's not very processor

667
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:57,099
intensive

668
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,890
i've i've tested it

669
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,089
doing tons and tons of analysis and
returning rules and

670
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:05,469
uh... you can actually get a file

671
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:09,150
scan and email sent to you almost
instantaneously

672
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,099
it doesn't take a lot of work and that's
with a lot of rules like

673
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:13,049
several

674
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:18,439
filed with the rules curriculum

675
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:20,059
there is the our project

676
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:22,920
and there is the standard business
monica's high five

677
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,849
uh... we've detected them our

678
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:28,809
sides coming to our network family party
classify identified in the past our

679
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:30,099
database

680
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,119
and uh...

681
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,779
everything's happy

682
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,349
if there's any more questions

683
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:41,129
abandoned him

684
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:42,069
i am not

685
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:44,060
allocator prepared all

686
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,149
on assisted told that i found very very
useful

687
00:35:47,149 --> 00:35:50,509
um... there have been many cases are
ready where i found a piece of malice

688
00:35:50,509 --> 00:35:57,509
command network and turn it on a before
any antivirus ready assets and caught it

689
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:04,549
i specifically like python i believe
they have ruby on that you have seen

690
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:06,459
i think there might even be pro

691
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:07,529
uh...

692
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:10,329
but yeah i'd gone there say and take a
look i'm sure there's tons of people of

693
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:15,190
r_d_ work for the before com their
documentations really really good

694
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,549
and and just so you can find out how to
actually been trying to a rally see a

695
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:21,589
little bit just to see if i cannot

696
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:25,919
enhanced is getting away from python and
doing some more

697
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:29,839
toward related things with a execute
walls uh... and inserting into other

698
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,449
applications that are using sheet
