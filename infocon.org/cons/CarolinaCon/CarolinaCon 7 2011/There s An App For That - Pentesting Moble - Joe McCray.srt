20
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,399
happy if you can reverse engineered
successfully

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,280
before the end of march mark

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,010

37
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,649
pretty much it

38
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,840
what are we up against

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,850
okay so from wikipedia asmara photos a
mobile phone the offers more advance

40
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,960
computing ability and collectivity

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,540
but a contemporary feature film

42
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,360
everybody

43
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,780
smartphones

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,250
and feature phones many fathers
hand-held computers and agreed with them

45
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,030
mobile telephone

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,570
well while most feature phones were able
to run applications based on platforms

47
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,430
such as java emmys

48
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,369
of smartphone

49
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,169
allows the user to install rome more
applications

50
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,260
him everybody

51
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,799
object so smart phones

52
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,440
one complete operating system software

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,809
providing a platform for obligation of
albert's

54
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:30,029
i don't think it looks pretty
interesting

55
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:31,999
i had some career advice

56
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:35,189
from someone that westwood meebo

57
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,689
many many months ago i used to compete
at these things called capture the flag

58
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,059
the deaf cut

59
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,419
there was this guy's names crocodile

60
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,849
in comedy would give the advised to
shells were those young pata wants right

61
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,020
wing group b_

62
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,669
italic

63
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,069
the chilies and things did not go to
jail

64
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,669
if you really want to be good at this
stuff you need to work on doing

65
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:55,849
whatever the scare market do

66
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,399
so he was the slick pocket

67
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,999
twelve years ago

68
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:04,159
childlike cleanup tactic and at sleep ap

69
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,099
scenes

70
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,469
over the years the same thing that
happened in our archie industry with

71
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:15,349
what we call the paper in csc has
happened to the security industry

72
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:20,379
as the as the industry progresses the
skill required to do certain tasks

73
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:24,079
becomes less and less because we have
more automated things to do it

74
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,349
so let's look at back in the good old
days

75
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,549
backward intrusion detection was like
someone just shit

76
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,750
work hard core packinghouses

77
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,960
doomed to break out to see if you don't
consume fucking do we don't want color

78
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,459
ship it was faxed back to work

79
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,059
was my people

80
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,129
was my people tax

81
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,069
so you're back there in your rep about
how to write your own filters

82
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,599
it all to speak at sort of scriptural
was sunk important at this wire

83
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,769
structure out we looked at mister max

84
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,329
right then we started in there with
sorority lab we started to like

85
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,779
dynamically processors are starting to
get really cool then all of a sudden all

86
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,180
these vendors came in

87
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,779
anna starters phyllis more signatures
and solid

88
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:06,649
the latest restarted stock yes

89
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:08,329
that's not all of a sudden

90
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:10,080
everybody's intrusion analyst

91
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,299
and all these guys

92
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:14,879
will come back what to do a good
configurator interface up are now

93
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,280
intrusion in adults

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,029
yes one of the packet died but i cannot
fire at one twenty spots that guy

95
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,110
so now what eventually happen said that
medal the guys that we've got driving

96
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:33,110
their ideas are effectively help best
facts because none of them dot art site

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,870
so valued got a guy who can't even
fuckin rewire shark

98
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:44,050
tort law i sent resumes look at the
holes

99
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,509
if you're watching

100
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:46,970
degenerate

101
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,490
it's so this is what happened intrusion
detection bill whether to contest it

102
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,940
the same thing happened right

103
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,849
everything was manual they were very few
testing tools

104
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:57,270
you're on your own scripts

105
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,639
all the suddenly started getting
automated vulnerability testing tools

106
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,610
and they were free

107
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,879
crew members were vessels was free

108
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,190
hallelujah

109
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,789
who fucked remembers when this is the
story

110
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,099
and that all of a sudden

111
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:12,770
all this commercial guys came in at the
start of still in the masses plugins

112
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,389
right around stoppin them because they
were muscles like down seven eighty two

113
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,039
solar started selling

114
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,699
than after awhile that led to automatic
ex-boyfriend works

115
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,550
val

116
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,580
can you may benefit tester who actually
has a clue

117
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,899
but seriously

118
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,020
butler says reflect

119
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,139
forever twenty protesters are like a cat
will pick you pick it up

120
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,270
particular to rewrite the script

121
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,560
came from over

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,279
today duplicate div div div

123
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,599
objection too that we compiled code

124
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,509
every one of the contest which they
don't architect impala application

125
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,339
like gcc invest all over the how to do
that way

126
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:52,379
will transfer are there ourselves at
what's ahead for what's what's there but

127
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:54,620
what about ido

128
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,650
what the fuck man

129
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,560
so

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,199
lele penthouse there is a jobless taylor
martinez

131
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,929
and helped us tax

132
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:08,189
so now those let us into where we are
right now with web applications

133
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:09,000
right now

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,159
web applications are starting to get
flooded the market

135
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,870
well application of overloaded stamps
your web inspector abscam of all that

136
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,539
event automated acts performers are
moving in that space as well

137
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,379
so you don't have those quick court
careless butter now started to do web

138
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,349
stuff

139
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,689
so that leads us to join us

140
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,770
that leaves us

141
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,039
mobile

142
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,110
and that leaves us the clout

143
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,650
what dispersal crocodile china tel me

144
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,110
was if you want to be a good time tester

145
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,520
but i don't want us to the people

146
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,649
have to pay you for kansas gear sheer

147
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,569
so you don't make a higher

148
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,259
a higher fee you've given him more
valuable

149
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,639
because you can do some shit but there's
no automated tool for

150
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,220
so right now that's bolbo and that's
clout

151
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,590
and so that's really tell what this talk
is about to list first look at some

152
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,559
mobile stuff

153
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,409
what's called one shower as i like the
site

154
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:04,799
art so what's going on

155
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,550
the first things you want to do if you
wanna start jack and mobile

156
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,869
you got to get your environment setup

157
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:13,769
so for me generally that's going to be
getting arrested take away a junior

158
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:17,630
emulators going to have all your
decompiler students was ready to go

159
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,099
so check your work

160
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,149
from your mobile platform after that

161
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,559
units also though so that you can
actually use before has a princess

162
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,469
platform

163
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:29,199
installing imap mcdonnell astral

164
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,059
noticeably all that kind of stuff

165
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:34,169
so that you can actually do some jacket
with the fall

166
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,159
after that we quickly moving to reverse
engineering

167
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,479
so did u d compilers goin

168
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,219
do uh...

169
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:44,689
uh... class dumping things like that so
that we can break some applications

170
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,319
apart and start seeing how we load

171
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,089
and then lastly actually mineral
exploits and then though final component

172
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,240
is uh... dealing with the webservice but
the client interacts with sewing

173
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,069
intestinal mobile at general you have
the client binary apoorva paul

174
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,039
amenable web service that the ap
interacts with

175
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,219
so watch it s the up that runs on the
phone effort as they were never think

176
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:09,400
like that

177
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,300
is a written in java as a written
objective c

178
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,069
unity hijacked the class load into
high-tech temporary storage

179
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,160
uh... certain positively concept of open

180
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,389
normal stuff

181
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,990
decision to pass that night
communicating with the webservice

182
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,989
normalweb protest

183
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:30,169
as soon as i got an answer questions of
terrorism

184
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:35,430
animals like for attitude towards people
more for the ship

185
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,030
foot yes

186
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,339
okay so dinner bar me going

187
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,690
regulated and biographer to give it up
and running

188
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,140
so getting there but we're going to
actually pretty easy

189
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,970
did you enjoy it as the k

190
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,570
load java

191
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,160
get yourself a repeat a reverse intools

192
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,280
trip and that's really all you need

193
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,390
onset partners they've got a into buzzer

194
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,660
uh... insists that there is no

195
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,460
uh...

196
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,980
manifest files are there are a couple of
thousand tools are pretty good

197
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,970
i would definitely check those out but

198
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,840
i would say the biggest thing is just to
get you in a way to do it

199
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,720
uh... the kitchen really are going to do
it as runway lights were on a mac

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,509
over windows doesn't matter

201
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:21,810
future and they were going to have to
continue with the mobile environment

202
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,300
and authored a bill to do the bulk of
their testing

203
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,690
particularly in the route your farm

204
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,210
on the iphone are foley gets a little
bit weirder

205
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:40,920
you don't have to go down the exco
terrell everybody's yeah

206
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,470
the thing that really got me with xcode
is steve jobs although he is an genius

207
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,670
when it comes to getting pay do you
think

208
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,070
fuckin genius

209
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,280
when it comes to making a product that's
remotely close to usable he's

210
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,170
often smoking crack

211
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,800
you have to sign up for this corny ass
xcode s detracting from ninety nine

212
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,070
dollars a year

213
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,309
you do with the pain

214
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:07,170
it was like ok will melt stroller
objective c

215
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,850
really boring who's really wanted to
hear me where buy me some alcohol after

216
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,660
this

217
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,119
decided knee-deep in some park in mexico
for the last couple weeks ambush it

218
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:18,420
makes no fucked insects

219
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,370
they've got all these m_s_ functions

220
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,370
thirteen from the next uh... operating
system

221
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,150
hello

222
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,160
the eighties back they want the eighties
colder water park in operating systems

223
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,980
back

224
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,610
what do you do it

225
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,589
burt always in the event sponsored calls
it and as database calls them

226
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:39,379
always

227
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,980
straight ahead the winds are while we we
have both

228
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,500
we have a lot

229
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,950
we have a buffer overflows because

230
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,140
compile-time testament contest

231
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,999
so we've got

232
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:52,220
remotely opts for a copy of the and
functions

233
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,990
who have star copy with the panel

234
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,010
doesn't bills we check it

235
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,030
problems like waltz pretty friggin cool

236
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,000
what's great but if you tried to
reference past the boundaries of an

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
array

238
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,370
if i can return zero doesn't suck fall

239
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,730
the pointer returns are source emerets
only five elements if i ask for element

240
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,460
number twenty which doesn't exist

241
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,810
at six o'clock

242
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,950
that should focus our focus it was uh...
by bushido return zero

243
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:27,380
all that we're having a security
exploiting press

244
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,340
okay so

245
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,350
didrex called or the cool thing about
once you get exploded loads the iphone

246
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,560
and ipod simulator right into it

247
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,209
so you build relapse

248
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,059
and immediately dragged them right over
into the simulator of fires up a little

249
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,560
hypo artpad

250
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,580
you can play with it just looked at the
phones parade

251
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,360
his levels of attack platform as soon as
you job break your phone denzel

252
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,860
the job market for mold city a pretty
much everything in the active

253
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,350
repositories

254
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,080
hallelujah you can go

255
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,870
payload will be one point eight sixteen
out load will be one point nine with the

256
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,690
trouble of medal sport

257
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,500
well ruby one point eight six

258
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,520
um... install a cessation as a six into
the plies install act

259
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,490
aniket acted install pretty much
anything you want

260
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,570
your your up in iran

261

um if you want to do this on

262
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,770
andrew lloyd

263
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,530
enjoy it has a juicy image

264
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,020
that you can use for contested really
really like this

265
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,960
so you can make baat

266
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,540
you get this uh...

267
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,760
scripting language for a enjoyed

268
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,380
so it loads pearl ruby python

269
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,090
all that cool stuff and i know where you
go

270
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,590
so here you can see we've got our

271
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,730
are utterly baseball

272
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:46,230
it's got him out w draft a map type b_
and c_ escapees busboy

273
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,840
all the stuff threat iraq

274
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,390
android lekar serve

275
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,120
uh... jailbreak it

276
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,490
and the ones who will sit here you can
just search it sets of functional

277
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,790
equivalent of about

278
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,269
we're searching said

279
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:04,850
or you can talk to commit wanted to act
have search aptitudes fall

280
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,880
just grab everything you want absolutely
works great

281
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,820
alm couple issues that were burrowed
into

282
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,700
i finally got g_a_t_t_ working on my
iphone still having issues with artful

283
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
amer

284
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,210
gcc

285
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,239
found out

286
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,399
that koppel

287
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,180
house blacklisted

288
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,909
the open-source version of

289
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,180
gcs sick

290
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,980
apple infinite wisdom face the gcc is
evil

291
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,950
so the juice is saying that you're
actually running is explodes older

292
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,020
riveted of gcc

293
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,330
so when you're trying to compile
applications are due notice that there's

294
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,899
like noticeable differences

295
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:44,839
if anybody

296
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,410
actually takes the

297
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,510
t-pain

298
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,389
induces alcohol consumption that is
reading

299
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:56,210
the apple less detailed documentation
you'll see that there's a lot of things

300
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,060
that they'll give you examples of that
they want you to compile explode

301
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,979
literally it was interesting to example
so

302
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,789
willis doesn't compile a list wrote

303
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:11,789
plans to call them a diversion of gcc

304
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:19,500
what the fuck

305
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,010
so yeah i i i just i just lost uh...
this is straight up for two months ago

306
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,299
opposed to a new team research project

307
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,359
and where i really did used to think
apples will cool down at the couple is

308
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:31,550
the ups and down the spark an operating
system on the planet

309
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,430
sorry are open hurt anyone's feelings

310
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,520
but it was weird

311
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,730
distance

312
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,830
at least the interaction with the iphone
in the i've had in these different

313
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,860
variations of i'll ask him

314
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,660
you know why they wanted a job raise
some stuff in there don't want you to

315
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,970
jail break in the mid week later they're
okay with that

316
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,230
what happened and i i have a marriage
like that that money

317
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,320
like autoplay large

318
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,090
director what was wrong with it what it
doesn't go along with apple

319
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,400
okay

320
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,130
so like i said make sure it will really
one point eight six for meadows when you

321
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,160
get all your stuff going on tonight
though

322
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,510
all right now onto the serious stuff
reversing

323
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,920
icon for meat only about one of those
like ninja reversals are going to do it

324
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,820
ari for

325
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,619
you're in your house or

326
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:20,660
i did not like the art of pro career but
working on

327
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,230
objective milk

328
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,520
you weren't they tell you enjoy it as to
tell you one of their own load on

329
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,290
somalia box molly

330
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,350
that got these uh... somewheres and this
is the worst

331
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,630
four out of the x_ files

332
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,920
uh... so when you get these files of
these different file types would roy

333
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,850
you wanna make sure that you can
disassemble them at the end of the day

334
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,950
it's just repeated girl and getting used
to what arm assembly looks like

335
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,800
so arm assembly for me before we send
message calls them

336
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,440
things like that took a little while to
get used to but

337
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,560
after a while

338
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,120
your economic growth

339
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,340
jump around zero rabbinical

340
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,410
and you can follow

341
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,900
barcode executions not

342
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,410
that at

343
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,689
wishing i was talking to other people
can work

344
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:04,899
here's a cracked me

345
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,639
uh... if you guys think the one that i
gave you earlier as a little too

346
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,740
difficult

347
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,340
try this one

348
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,540
download this will have to do whatever
it cracked me

349
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,780
there were gonna play with get used to
it

350
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,320
the thing but i really like it in the
i'd fall spaces called clutch if yours

351
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,050
is a mess

352
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,600
fostered rocks

353
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
when you try a little clutch who will
tell you that your

354
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,960
downloading stuff from the legal
repository

355
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,740
that's probably does something really
back to your phone

356
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,080
but to me

357
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,340
the rewards outweigh the risk you know i
mean this thing is better ship

358
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,630
clutch decrease your ita file so the
i_p_o_ file is the application package

359
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,370
the files come from in the itunes store

360
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,850
clutch de cristo file so that you can
reverse it inside out

361
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,669
so they don't have a t_-forty encryption
to look at any more

362
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:57,760
club's history

363
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,910
dual howling jesus

364
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,880
if you don't look like to have a job
working for new download the apt

365
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,459
you pay for that one time once you do

366
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,870
deep the cricket with clutch you can
download the active people without ever

367
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,250
having to pay forty jack

368
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,150
gotta love this absolutely gotta love
this

369
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,180
that so at that point you grab the ap

370
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,120
naked over to your desktop

371
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,620
uh... you haven't noticed that the
optimism ita file you can rename it as

372
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,539
that

373
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:32,770
orville actually on about on a mac you
can just right click and say a

374
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,210
uh... so package contents though extract
that

375
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:42,169
them in the actual executed over a
binary but we'll try to provide a pro

376
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:43,130
okay

377
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:50,130
there's no one read answer with actually
trying to exploit them

378
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,559
no normal it'll still work

379
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,490
useful work but a lot of people would do
it because here's question

380
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,400
but this first question was if you do it
could be up moving from photo only still

381
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,600
get updates the answer is no we will not
get

382
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,520
updates

383
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,780
but the ap works

384
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,140
know which you can do absorb a notice a
lot of people were doing this with uh...

385
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,690
ratso

386
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,029
uh... tiny umbrella of all these
different job return programs

387
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,070
their job original phone

388
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,710
back you up

389
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,180
and that would restore the phone and
restoring a backup

390
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,500
so at the compound before the accident
looks like there

391
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,920
we can advocate for road

392
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
article

393
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,450
bizarre ran into

394
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,100
uh... try to do some research and rights
of exploits of the best advice i can

395
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,090
give you is trying to do some detective
work and look at work or other people

396
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,240
were going

397
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,420
swords or bombs exploit bb apakah storm
started do door michael going

398
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,720
and started noticing

399
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,460
boulevard

400
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,900
ton of directorate reversals

401
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,200
for our collapse

402
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,940
but most of them

403
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,050
director to russell director commercial
director to restore

404
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,210
but there were two projected too

405
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:12,130
they're all those electrical last work
by what's

406
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,720
just over over over der right

407
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,650
well not exactly the smartest actor
world

408
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,350
but i would venture to guess that
they've got an issue with permission of

409
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,500
them

410
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,550
multiple went on inside for personal is
don't seem to have a very controversial

411
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,260
walter well anybody with me

412
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,940
willl sumption here

413
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,820
so if you get another athlete you have
to test would be worthwhile

414
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,030
that the ap sponsor webserver

415
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,570
locally to try director to restore me
out

416
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,630
would be worthwhile at the apt
references a temporary file

417
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,100
so let's say the ap rights to a
temporary file and socks that consumes

418
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,660
the ap

419
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,520
consumes the prob active to render it
later

420
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,520
would be worthwhile to try director
commercial

421
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,900
content wink wink nudge nudge

422
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,289
works

423
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:07,890
this works apple is still in the same
paint but i have spoken in early two

424
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,820
thousand member how we have yumiko tax
ticketless all the way from inti for all

425
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,419
the way up there with those two thousand
service pack two

426
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,399
and all these different iterations of
the dot gov slash a taxable baltimore

427
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:20,500
toted types

428
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,470
apple is susceptible to the exact

429
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,520
so's you deal with multiple us these
director to brussels or all over the

430
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,940
place

431
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,830
all over the place

432
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,090
one of starting to find as i work with
developers

433
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,280
the ups or salsa balkan so simple but
just not right of a lot of air here

434
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,090
where they're not right of a lot of
balance checking them out

435
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,420
right have a lot of

436
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,490
uh... session management that justice
just maybe yes maybe after work

437
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,600
it literally what you do with the most
cases is that

438
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
is a

439
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,850
one website browsing around

440
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,150
that's it right here the client this is
the tap it runs on the politics out of

441
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,110
his client itself

442
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,470
object to see this corridor just browse
is a one page website

443
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,259
doing so

444
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,659
if that's all they're doing team of
developers eyes why we're gonna write

445
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,960
all the spare him believe it

446
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,090
you know balance jackie in an election
stuff amid it's just a click about site

447
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,720
so that's that

448
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,080
it's that thought process that leads to
all these different vulnerabilities

449
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,770
that's that i will look for is really
look and see what's going on with

450
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,330
malware

451
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,230
from our community is really going to
show you what's going on in a lot of

452
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,049
cases

453
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:36,100
there might even fully exploit loopholes
monopoly job which of the phones

454
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,050
and uh...

455
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,320
you know it's all in our tries to get
the correct somewhere else

456
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
a lot of profit based stuff

457
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,590
not a whole lot bsa mess at this point
but it is coming

458
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,220
people talk about that's a mystery spot
nets

459
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,320
it also it's if there were two parts of
our

460
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,350
uh... groups out there doing a little
bit of it

461
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,149
but i don't really have a lot of fortune
in code on that

462
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,150
day but it does how fortunate

463
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,179
uh... as a mess

464
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,340
uh... situ koto definitely susanna

465
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,540
because i think though that will help us
as protesters out

466
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,659
so attack on the web services i was
culture paranoid

467
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:14,940
about what doing with the web services
would be like to see it as a start to

468
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,990
get on the phone

469
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,280
well remember what i said

470
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,200
assist the client

471
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,940
browse the web page right

472
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,270
foley browsing

473
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,870
one for key players

474
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:30,840
so at that point once you figure out the
gigolo brb swayed on your phone

475
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,210
isn't it just the regular went up in
just

476
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,080
let's all of us it's just a regular
webapp in test

477
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,690
all wool unocal ran at him

478
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:47,280
well how much he loved it does look like
a web inspect

479
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,580
sucks to be a bit

480
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,550
jet so really what's going on this is
just a regular manual whether contest

481
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,000
just like we used to do

482
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,809
out before we have almost coalescing
automated tools

483
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,530
that last fall

484
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,020
clueless protesters

485
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,700
it's the same thing

486
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,040
dealing with the soap envelope is no
different you don't need an automated

487
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,210
scared to do it

488
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,590
but generally the websites but they're
connected to are not so complex of

489
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,030
russell large which are generally
require an automated scanners

490
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,360
orchestrated c_n_n_ back home

491
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,940
it was just a tiny little website but

492
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,549
process credit card

493
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:27,840
logic check your balance on your bank or
whatever

494
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,380
i'd say it out

495
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,950
uh... only because

496
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,060
i have talked so much has been all over
the

497
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,080
norway

498
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,659
about two months ago and

499
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:40,600
definitely put my foot in mind

500
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,410
went over there and in europe

501
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,669
mobile painting is light years ahead of
where we are

502
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:50,720
intervals mobile bay canceled my bank
customers now

503
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,539
around doing anything like what my bank
customers

504
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,740
uh... your apartment i went over there

505
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,700
and i had to cancel hartwell so

506
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,539
sit-down shut the fuck up

507
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,440
we do this on the regular over here

508
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,000
iran your everything richard jack white
that every culture

509
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,309
optimality

510
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:11,870
ever had that happen

511
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,519
so i guess that's right let's sit down
shut up

512
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,110
uh... looks like the kind of a lot of
how they're doing over here

513
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,250
then actually got the rest of the up at
no they don't know if they go

514
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,090
they just fell more pocket money

515
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,100
they adopt the technologies before we do

516
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,220
so as soon as this banking is a big deal
with it

517
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,630
when you actually look at it it's still
a mix of real strength passing the data

518
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,649
anna still connected to a web service so
there's really no functional difference

519
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:41,179
you know if they were saying that
they're doing in europe it's really took

520
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,090
an awesome balls

521
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,370
bill ashely issue keith jackson the bank
customers

522
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,919
so you how

523
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,070
a smart card you'll have

524
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,170
in our essay equal in tokyo

525
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,950
with the one-time password on the
numbers of all that

526
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,530
to do your banking so they're willing to
give you the

527
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,170
seventy five dollars

528
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,970
token so you can do your thing in our
banks over here local expensive

529
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,670
we collect making a movie about of our
customers want

530
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,100
as a people who work at the back to it

531
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,820
if you just say that

532
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,340
with my boss isn't working

533
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,420
uh...

534
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,910
it so

535
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,380
knowledgeable of mobile global standards

536
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,830
do we have a lot so i a m milestone this
too

537
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,100
all that kind of course of four mobile
space the answers what

538
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,390
hale well

539
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,809
day it's the wild wild west out there
ma'am

540
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:46,809
if people would tell you that they
follow some methodology they made it up

541
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,770
it is what it is they made about

542
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,230
have standard sha we have some people
working on it

543
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,980
you know you're good for callosum your
groups like there are two of your people

544
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,710
were killed and stuff

545
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,350
but there's no industry accepted
standard for securing mobile

546
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,080
applications or secure mobile optus

547
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,240
so it's not like you have a whole lot of
we way to say

548
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,850
well we're using this does this is what
they

549
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,190
interested tar

550
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,760
know what you told customers are not the
helen do it

551
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,080
that's one test in europe

552
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,420
i've had some customers who were looking
for someone who's got a lot of mobile

553
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,960
opt out of your experience

554
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,450
we'd all of a person who's to say we
have a lot of webapp auto experts for a

555
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,050
lot of

556
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,970
suffer development experience and i
think it's a

557
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,410
fair question that house

558
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,030
but i think it's a little to do with the
industry

559
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,560
to be requiring out of your testers
right now

560
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,820
for those of you who are interested in
testimony was it has already currently

561
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,910
protested mobile aps

562
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,990
couple people

563
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,040
that have have you guys are alot of
assault with customers

564
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,670
sent there a hereto or ten a m

565
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,250
your hindley killzone

566
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:57,990
everybody else run scarce

567
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,070
all right so

568
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,190
what undoing a web of just one of our
doing are go for the basics

569
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,359
alternatives so

570
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,890
authorization input validation

571
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,720
there have only data security alarm

572
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,000
a go for the basics

573
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,220
big big things that i've been really
trying to jack with lately

574
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,330
temporary storage

575
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,549
people write about

576
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,779
rights to attempt file somewhere

577
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:23,570
or temp directory or scratch director
here

578
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,570
whatever

579
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,340
and then they turn around and we consume
a file later or per processing

580
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,840
if you're allowed to mollify that file

581
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,230
that is my first files back there

582
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,750
try to see watch it to do to the apt

583
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,810
actor and

584
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,000
team you can make it out crash

585
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,539
just people they don't trust the source
trust the destination right

586
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,740
typical program in principle

587
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,800
army only one right into this directory
no one else is going to be read into

588
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,970
that uh... directory

589
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,600
so there's no point in doing any input
validation on the temporary file

590
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,679
huge mistake happens all the time

591
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,360
i guarantee you go to your first pushed
too far

592
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,020
time of our abilities

593
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,010
parson heiress bought for overflows all
kinds of stuff

594
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,560
almost as i read it too

595
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,330
with uh... xcode is to have their own
e_p_ i_ is that they really want to use

596
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,840
that want to use a lot of

597
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,760
uh... external third-party libraries

598
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,210
so allot of people will say illnesses
argument that the code inside of the

599
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,850
itunes marketplace

600
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:29,899
is more secure them the code and the
head right market place trust

601
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:33,429
anytime but compared to postal code
open-air drug repository

602
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:36,720
but you've got to go through these
really stringent requirements of

603
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,790
using apple a p_r_ further toward your
right to get into to get into ideals

604
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,630
and given them a piece of your profit

605
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,080
because we all know that strategy

606
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,510
don't you feel like those are stringent
requirements

607
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,710
but i think so

608
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,060
that's up my puzzles a secure like your
pay any money

609
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,780
fed so

610
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,360
this is the beta boulders guide in a
sense paper howling for later we was

611
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,429
actually qualify and you know
statistically them out about where that

612
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:07,009
perk

613
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:12,080
per application per capita the pearls
actual normal wear and the itunes

614
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,040
there wasn't and repetitive per mat

615
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,780
everybody has a statistic

616
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,280
say that after that what s the web
service go from the web

617
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,410
buckets everything else

618
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,779
berikut really is the top ten

619
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:29,669
uh... i thought this was actually pretty
good days hooked up with a company

620
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:31,210
called look now

621
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,240
maybe overlooked offered roared

622
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,110
of erco two will travel to up you know i
guess there

623
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,889
blueblood bloody finger

624
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:41,200
europe recover what will happen is
almost a whitepaper

625
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,430
michael ideals like eight

626
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,420
the salute to talk to her mobile aps

627
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,880
uh... they didn't really said it best
practices guides or anything like that

628
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,220
but i'm hoping that that comes in the
future

629
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,920
all while spousal mobile security
project

630
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,440
that um... i think is now a half a page
i think it's really great like real

631
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,040
serious progress

632
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,549
first before i was just the lives of
some people but now it's like

633
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:05,460
uh... melaka paragraph about like a

634
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,150
readable

635
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,060
sparks

636
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,799
progress we'd mobile

637
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,330
of some references

638
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,080
i like your silver bear code

639
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,690
our customer

640
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,119
uh... last month to ask me for this
developer best practices guide

641
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,520
whether they wanted like in two days so
it's horrible

642
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,529
please do not take this is the gospel

643
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,130
but it's something we threw together
really really quickly

644
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,909
system or the walking through it

645
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:39,039
uh... will we be updated and clean it up
over time yes there's probably even

646
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,540
promerco medical errors because

647
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,730
i definitely think it'll points in the
right direction for enjoyed secure

648
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,120
software development also here are some
other resources is things that i thought

649
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,260
were pretty helpful for me when i was
messing around with it

650
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,220
um...

651
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,270
it's been an interesting thing for me

652
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,020
art over november last year was were
really started up a phone calls for

653
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,860
mobile

654
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,389
at one of you guys are starting to
experience this book tour

655
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:11,700
the sheer sense of

656
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,850
urgency in the customer

657
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,360
is completely different

658
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,570
example

659
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,740
january

660
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,480
give them a conference call

661
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,310
customer says

662
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,200
we are a hotel chain

663
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,470
we've got uh... it brand new mobile out

664
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,480
speculated january

665
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,950
we need

666
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,290
we need the about

667
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,659
the java version

668
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:33,940
for android

669
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,700
and the objective c version

670
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,980
uh... i phone we made them both tested
before the month is over

671
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,519
hazardous to your production

672
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,800
in two weeks

673
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,899
because like

674
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:57,899
gesture

675
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:09,390
wheat

676
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,309
simpson will for you

677
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:22,850
but but

678
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,779
want to use them

679
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:31,380
though it does

680
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,570
summary what do you really is a full
relationship won't work

681
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:40,020
almost has a lot of light threatened
strike threat model relationship like

682
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,390
really so if they respond very well

683
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:46,100
whatever the reason why i would say that
with this fare very well wrestled with

684
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,650
her sister worker episode

685
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,470
lists restaurants

686
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,470
i want to see the gantt chart words like
all project manage their don't

687
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:06,690
or

688
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,059
if you don't see that

689
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:10,900
but it's so

690
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,300
doesn't it then that's all i got my
presentation personal questions now

691
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,230
cricket cricket cricket cricket

692
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:25,230
question

693
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,120
i have some very good care so special
this question was is my research

694
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,620
primarily for personal

695
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,809
wifi or do i get into

696
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:34,550
three g seaview mary

697
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,179
gprs all the other cool stuff

698
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:41,070
my answer is r_e_m_ just now learning
g_s_ though

699
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,610
alike media collect personal

700
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,830
uh... rainbow table

701
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,660
a fifty one research right now

702
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,630
so i'm like the burton birthday d

703
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,580
uh... and outside a robot definitely
movement for that

704
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,679
right now the customer brings us the
aperture without concern general concern

705
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:59,590
for my customers for a quick as them

706
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,340
decibel rips apart of some of gel breast
the phone

707
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,559
what type of application security

708
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,350
activity ap

709
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:14,350
to do with that which consisted
substances

710
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:22,070
yes

711
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,170
so question was what i have a question
or that i have an opportunity who work

712
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:29,190
with the customer emma them a
preliminary stages with the map

713
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,039
about actually weapons practices that
came from

714
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,769
so what was happening was in this
particular case it was kind of like

715
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:36,099
uh...

716
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:38,239
in each trade white type about

717
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,779
where you could like larger than chacko

718
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,489
check your balance as of the trade you
want to make it

719
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:48,719
all that and things that they want to
know wasn't apple for specifically

720
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,119
that before has the ability to hibernate

721
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,000
so what's a um in the after my full
range

722
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,438
you can hibernate what it'll do source

723
00:34:56,439 --> 00:35:00,720
of the current application will send cd
message events

724
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,170
like a wake from sleep at all that's a
lot of notes back

725
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,829
so they want to know what our
recommendations for a story credentials

726
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:10,269
like the recognized for teaching

727
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:13,259
so were also filesystem crypto

728
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:16,509
and we also want to know how should we
handle session management

729
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:18,909
uh... if the at gets background

730
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,659
so if the optics background it should we
handle such a mentor to require a

731
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:23,719
password

732
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:27,159
to get the outback going to give some
require passcode

733
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,679
something like that that the other going
to give we give the customer the myself

734
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,639
treated just like some sort of
potentially of that

735
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,819
you know if you have such a time al were

736
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:38,519
that you get up and walk away from a
computer and come back

737
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,889
worry authenticate to the special so
it's kind of ours

738
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:49,889
yes all we want to use

739
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:59,189
this is exactly what i serve our
customers keep asking us about them

740
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:01,399
i have to put to a customer this way

741
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:05,269
unlike okay he wrote an application if
the person was on windows of the

742
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,080
proposals croatian the system

743
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,669
work interactive

744
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:15,499
your apt to do nothing your your your
your printer admit your room your sister

745
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:20,609
really has nothing to do because joe
brokerages fall all bets are off

746
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:22,239
this is why a lot of malware

747
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,429
uh... specifically the upon our worst
targeted job broken bones

748
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:29,419
that there really is nothing you can do

749
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:32,030
you can't just wanted to start with when
would be

750
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,720
very very signature bears to be looked
at this particular strip about where

751
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,530
that goes

752
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,989
x

753
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,440
worked hard to

754
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,269
i don't think you're going to be able to
do

755
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,530
much more than that

756
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:49,799
agenda about some expert on this is just
a couple of months about some of it

757
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:56,289
to me if i wrote about every doctor was
escalates the system

758
00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:02,889
i don't know what the hell

759
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:05,219
starmeter answer

760
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:12,219
well so far

761
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,500
that sounds pretty cool

762
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,839
i've never dealt with that right now

763
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,409
uh... we just got finished responded to
our fire and the big thing that they

764
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:40,669
will look at it wasn't could be in the
pool over

765
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:42,869
of both android and apple

766
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:45,290
uh... the cancer from our customer has
been

767
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:49,299
if we have a phone we want to try to
apply for this contraption

768
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,349
basically what the dirty made hack

769
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,940
the support to get to the boot loader

770
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,819
what to do some sort so that's been what
we've been experimenting with

771
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,369
i haven't really seen people permit
enterprise level

772
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:05,029
able to deal with

773
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:06,429
rudy bombs

774
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:11,149
uh... so-called propose a person who
makes the product

775
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:13,279
good makes that

776
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:19,629
picture

777
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:26,439
rochelle

778
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:30,890
uh... ideas feels good to talk to me
uh... outlook calendar in application

779
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,249
right

780
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:36,949
group going calendar workers

781
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:43,949
mister tractor art

782
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:59,929
don't show

783
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,869
membership so so so it grandma got a
couple hundred here

784
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:11,779
that it would be a lot for our challenge

785
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:16,450
that they were

786
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:23,450
first

787
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:35,229
uh... do you have customers that are
really dealing with partner

788
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:46,969
the gardens research today will be close
to that would be charlie miller

789
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:53,279
well in order matter personal to work
out of a text message

790
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:55,009
yeah i was always rifle

791
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,059
all

792
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:01,439
on such are a little bit agreed to park
to see that we could sense but i don't

793
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:03,199
know anybody who's

794
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,929
was even working a restriction close to
that

795
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:09,009
so so the concern is you've got a

796
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:13,639
you've got s_a_s_ tight outfits in the
clout in that sense text messages

797
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:20,639
when restore or whatever type of there

798
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,550
appears to have to have a there

799
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,030
you have to have the same

800
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,729
functionality working or its testes

801
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:54,919
i mean that's that's basically what you
do it right

802
00:40:54,919 --> 00:41:00,259
you know the process aria or assisted
the push is this a mess

803
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:04,949
uh... activity support could be some
sort

804
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:06,749
vessels are so style

805
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:09,219
which is uh... sometimes

806
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:16,219
stories were cancerous or baboon your
clients are

807
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:22,169
jacqueline severability of school
accords it's only going to be like to

808
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:23,019
know

809
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:24,809
texas' parts in there

810
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:28,479
so hard whatever application parables
text or substantial partial correctly

811
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,209
ranked

812
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:33,419
but certainly to causing her application
researcher color execution of the total

813
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:36,989
executions out sort code no rpm sabar
brilliant

814
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:38,769
uh... i think that's less likely

815
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:42,249
i think your more likely to happen which
has some issues

816
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,519
which was part of the panel out here

817
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,729
uh... getting onto the apple mcleod
controller applebee's personal sort of

818
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:52,819
well former glory analog-to-digital
network that point

819
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:57,669
acted c which about where to the device
is an excellent i could see

820
00:41:57,669 --> 00:42:02,219
the rubble possibility here

821
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,689
i would try to focus more on testing the
individual

822
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,289
output has an orderly clough protested

823
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:11,049
okay so i i have a customer

824
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:14,729
and uh... he's got a cloud of limitation
and we've been having these massive

825
00:42:14,729 --> 00:42:16,039
phone calls or

826
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,769
how we're going to test it

827
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:21,389
because like you religions every cloud
implementations

828
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:24,479
slightly different my guess is your
messages

829
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,479
type thing

830
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,679
it's going to be a particular
implementation of

831
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,179
always different libraries of
applications suite of applications

832
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:32,969
together

833
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,759
to make that happen so active ceo

834
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:38,689
one size fits all type of

835
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,809
that uh... we could call it security

836
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,339
server security

837
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:44,689
tired zero

838
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,819
get upset

839
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:49,649
effect any other questions

840
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:51,869
cricket cricket cricket

841
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,539
especial what what what we were out of
it
