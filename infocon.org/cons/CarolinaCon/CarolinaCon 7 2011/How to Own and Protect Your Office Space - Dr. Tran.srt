1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,040
so

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,499
thanks everyone for attending my talk

3
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:12,559
psalm here to talk about how
inconsistent security policies lazy

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,329
contractors in just a bit neglect the
proper up practices

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,929
can really create an exposure for your

6
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,090
office or your datacenter whatever so
you're trying to protect

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,930
uh... it's not meant to be an
encyclopedia of how to break into a

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,640
building but ill give that you thinking
on how some low-tech techniques

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,570
and as how you can use things you find
around the office

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,970
to get the places you shouldn't

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,940
so here's what the

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,440
the agenda disclaimer

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,940
and he could talk has to have a
disclaimer

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,850
who i am

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,500
why you really care about physical
security

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,810
i really don't office some of the
exterior bomber billy's interior bona

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,730
billy's and then just a quick summary

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,810
but before i begin

19
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,220
i wanted to clear that this talk will be
subject to the you drink protocol

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,610
eugen protocol something that deviant
have put together last year to make

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,070
talks with the more interactive between
the speaker and the audience

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,450
so basically the presenter will share
with them

23
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,680
with the audience one of their favorite
drinks

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,410
get a little bit background on it

25
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,890
show the recipe actually make a batch of
it on stage

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,960
and then whatever the speaker messes up
the materials are makes mistake or

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,310
is just an idiot

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,300
the audience and calm on it and have to
take a drink

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,090

30
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,050

call them out on

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,470

that they're spitting out

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,480

i like to take things apart like to take

101
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,659
cars apart electron x whatever it is up
in picking locks for about two years now

102
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:02,279
solo site

103
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:09,279
for those who say t-shirt

104
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:16,569
that

105
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:30,009
uh...

106
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,189
stuff

107
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,669
dot

108
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,610
right

109
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,610
he says

110
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,800
past acts

111
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,009
that

112
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,430
such expensive as well

113
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,550
application

114
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,930
dot

115
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,809
dot

116
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:16,830
customer gone

117
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,949
and how many companies still have sacks
of paper or documents because for

118
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,870
information or passwords or whatever it
is

119
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,139
just sitting there

120
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,120
such a that the call center where this
customer service involve credit card

121
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,389
processing

122
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,629
obscene call centers where there are
possible represents writing down credit

123
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:34,880
card numbers for notes because they have
to go to another machine

124
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,339
process that credit card

125
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,979
and easily that sitting out on their gas

126
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,379
and then finally

127
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,770
shiny things

128
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,270
i know i leave my android phone sitting
on my cuba locked up in a cabin when i

129
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,559
walk away

130
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,259
someone can walk it's a start still
expensive stuff

131
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,639
so not just about

132
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,379
data they could steal but physical
assets of

133
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:55,740
of the company war

134
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,489
employees

135
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,650
so most felons on security like

136
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,080
government agencies

137
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,659
and at the end of the day

138
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:05,319
big really don't have to be

139
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,659
really have to look at you've to go to
user risk-based approach where you look

140
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:11,949
at what are the rest your company what
are the crown jewels

141
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,940
that could be stolen physically not just
logically

142
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,729
so whether it's cost for information
that may be on paper files

143
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:22,639
or physical assets like a main faction
company

144
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,229
so i want to talk about how dickens
inconsistencies and how company may

145
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:32,320
implement physical security or secured
in general some laziness in implementing

146
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
this controls

147
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,920
and and in the collect

148
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,910
and

149
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,910
exercise-induced controls

150
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,830
so the first thing i want to talk about
where the

151
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,500
exterior bom abilities

152
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,899
most of the stuff a lax lead for the
exterior

153
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,810
will be more social engineering than
actual technique

154
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,790
what with most things it's nice and hard
on the outside

155
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,810
butts off the squishy on the inside

156
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,830
i think al knows all about that right

157
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,640
but the fact that

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,630
not

159
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,760
so the first

160
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,310
first thing when you go through a front
door

161
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,090
usually greeted

162
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,700
cope

163
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,180
everyone that there was such a nice
someone is very helpful was will the

164
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,210
show you where you need to go

165
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,530
but at the end the day yes

166
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,260

167
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,400
but at the end of the day our
receptionist is not the security guard

168
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,659
perception this is there to be helpful
to route where they need to be

169
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,070
they're not there to stop

170
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,330
challenge inmate

171
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,250
someone's life uh... difficult

172
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:44,250
a security guard is it there to do that

173
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,119
and then work

174
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,639
and then we had you have a lobby for
multi tenant building six special in new

175
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,260
york city where you have mobile tenants
in the building up a lobby

176
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,850
everyone has

177
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,360
at one thousand are fighting back to the
states to swipe and or at least i have a

178
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,550
back-to-work

179
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,210
i don't think i've ever seen a compass
does not have a batch or some type of

180
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,420
identification

181
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,020
for the facility looks like a small mom
and pop shop

182
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,990
most of time these badges are our fight
bien your part to scan

183
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,320
now on like indeed movies

184
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,010
the your picture is not stored on the
back to camp acrobat input another

185
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,740
picture in it if you packet

186
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,560
if you if you still back

187
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,360
what happens on the back end it is

188
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,410
dispatch has a number of side to it when
you select that patch it'll spread out

189
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,610
number one two three four five

190
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,840
and on the back and system it'll
correlate one two three four five months

191
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,900
of this person yaz access

192
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:42,140
and then your mug shots look up come up
on that back

193
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,700
so so

194
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,389
in the mood the movies and

195
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:50,709
shows a twenty-four slap you can talk
about you put your own picture in it if

196
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,900
you find one laying on the street

197
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,910
and really the control it is

198
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,850
four a lobby security attorneys like
that back to your mug shot comes up as

199
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,220
security guards wilson book and make
sure

200
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,770
that you are who you are not some random
person who may have uh...

201
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,160
just take a few picture

202
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,910
on the back

203
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,880
there some facilities that don't don't
require a slight through the front door

204
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,300
they just make sure you got it back

205
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,529
if you think about it in the morning
what everyone's rushing into the office

206
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:20,439
how carefully calculus where the
security guards we looking at this

207
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:21,279
badges

208
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,620
i mean you could probably have a blank
piece of card

209
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,000
this flash that intellectual and

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
and then one f

211
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,010
caught like someone who if they are

212
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,950
with an official-looking batches walks
in the says i wanted to work on your

213
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,530
telecom equipment

214
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,250
ornate so look at this site word ups or
fedex

215
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,420
is security really trained to stop a
child and verified that they are

216
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,360
supposed to be there

217
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,690
i mean the real ideal set up

218
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,040
is to have security guard who's looking
at the pictures stand maybe ten atleast

219
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,460
ten feet away

220
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,309
from the reader

221
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,629
so they have time to actually look at
the picture compared to the person are

222
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:04,640
walking up

223
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,580
is if you do in the morning rush hour we
do have a look at toward people coming

224
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,600
and they're not gonna be able to scan
every wednesday to confirm the art new

225
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,700
york

226
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,610
and also secure a should be trade never
allow anyone in without verification so

227
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,170
you know someone oficial looking comes
in

228
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,020
but not to let them in

229
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,400
and then we'll talk about the back door
or the loading dock

230
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,580
people like that thus the front door is
what most people see so secure is the

231
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,560
pay most attention to the front door

232
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,600
but what about that back door where

233
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,370
shipments might be coming in or a
facilities needs to move appointment

234
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,350
is that secure

235
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,940
first thing as are those doors

236
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,600
others doors close are they propped open
with a brick that says door stop did not

237
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,880
move

238
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,890
you have to make sure that facilities
and security knows to not that get the

239
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,920
tree they're back door

240
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,360
the same as the front door

241
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,090
that goes back to consistency

242
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,990
why do they treat one door more securely
to the other

243
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,390
get the proper monitor control this of
someone there you're probably not going

244
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,840
to have a security guard receptionist in
the back door loading dock but you will

245
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,900
in the front door

246
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,270
so you need something to keep track of
what's going on back there

247
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,800
and then access control

248
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,890
is at the same type access control do
you have the same key control systems

249
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:27,210
same type of high security locks as your
front and back to work

250
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,339
and then finally

251
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,540
do you have a fence its

252
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,220
additional fence around something casual
caught come out of work to comity

253
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,770
coming through the back door and someone
may not know if that's a lot more

254
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,690
obvious in someone's hopping a fence
trying to get in

255
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,990
and some of his walking off the street

256
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,540
and there's a smoker's entries which are
caught like to call the side door

257
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,300
how many of here are some on the people
here smokers

258
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,920
about many

259
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,810
uh...

260
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,970
unit right outside smoking right now

261
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,780
so user smokers entrance is not really
designed to be a smoker sentences as a

262
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,780
side door that smokers like to use

263
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,720
and for those who are smokers

264
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,440
you know no matter what that bought the
weather is out there you're going to go

265
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,680
out there to get your facts

266
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,420
an adult is also camaraderie between
smokers and in the world i think that

267
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,950
you can't smoke in and bars anymore in
philadelphia

268
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,820
so if there's a lot of camaraderie

269
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,790
so if you look at the fellow smoker out
there that says

270
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,019
all hail uh... it's really collateral
mike that inside the mind pausing in

271
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,850
soft wok around

272
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,129
smokers are probably not like you and so
there's a

273
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:41,030
there's a huge piggy backing problem
there

274
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,450
and the solution to that is pretty
simple

275
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,870
jazz you just have a sense in or
security smoking area

276
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,460
so that way someone off the street can't
hang out with the smoke or separate tend

277
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,940
to be an employee that left her back
inside

278
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,750
so that we think it can be back in

279
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,810
i mean your you're smoking areas
lobbyist fancy is this it could be

280
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,230
symbols offense

281
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,730
but depending on your fire code you may
want to make sure you have a fire

282
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:08,730
acceptance of everyone uh... exits at
door that they're not trapped

283
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,460
so with a lot baxter tear your bona bill
is as i mentioned that they're more or

284
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,190
less social engineering taking advantage
of the human factor as a human

285
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,249
is the weakest link

286
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,249
computers just knows ones and zeros
whether you're allowed access you did

287
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:24,060
not

288
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,270
wall a person that you can

289
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,940
there's a whole

290
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,100
gradient upgraded to take advantage of

291
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,900
but with

292
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,060
interior vulnerabilities

293
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,310
this but this is the fun stuff this is
the fun stuff now you can just basically

294
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,160
pickups off coupon around the office and
get the places you know

295
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,530
you're not supposed to be

296
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,880
so motion sensors a lot of people

297
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,510
you'll see a lot of offices that have
those double glass doors are fighting

298
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,620
back to swipe in

299
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,100
but when you exit you don't need to back
out or do anything that's because of the

300
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,280
motion sensor

301
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,040
so when you walk up

302
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,950
trips

303
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,070
allows u_n_

304
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,440
and depending on

305
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,230
this is the placement of censor the type
of two words matches opened that with

306
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,390
the simple that manila folder

307
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,810
if you saw back in the folded photo
there will be a very large gap between

308
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,500
the glass doors and motion sensors so
what the triple motion sensor

309
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,410
so i think it was casually walk off

310
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,830
and a slip that fullest immensely
cutthroat

311
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,270
that'll trip the motion sensors mine
nine parent times out of time have tried

312
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,220
it works

313
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,390
yes that super that looks a little uh...
suspicious

314
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,230
lager walking up to a door

315
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,950
with the folder or stack of papers

316
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:46,950
these look like someone who belongs
there

317
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,060
yeah sorry

318
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,650
at the pens a lot of people don't tune
up properly

319
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,320
ste and those motion sensors date not
only detect motion

320
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,790
but the also detect temperature
gradients

321
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,689
so you can actually use a can of
compressed air flipped upside down

322
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,720
to create a cloud of cold air

323
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,250
to trip up the sensors

324
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,780
so

325
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,939
yes eleven health well so this is an
example

326
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:22,939
this is a unknown office building

327
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,610
so i'm closing the door

328
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,670
rattling to make sure it's locked

329
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,120
the topic and across their work

330
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,120
no

331
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,300
with motion sensor achievement in the
drinks as he made it really good com

332
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,850
about tuning

333
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,450
so

334
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,159
you can tune is motion sensors so that
way

335
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,700
you get you put the sausage further back

336
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,130
to lend them to be not a sense of insert
direction you can join types of things

337
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,350
now you move the sensor for the back of
course at that time it

338
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,450
so that way when someone walks towards
the door once a row the range the sensor

339
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,000
they walk into the door

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,110
so

341
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,750
you have to be careful

342
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,820
on her howdy to mean that

343
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,350
immature some of my out want watching
the camera so which you'll see later on

344
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,659
uh... desolate

345
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:36,030
when i was going to doing cool using
google image try to find some pictures

346
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,830
of people walking in the doors i did a
search for a

347
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,429
people walking in doors analyst every
single picture was a picture of justine

348
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,529
deboer walking to a class wall

349
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:48,590
i don't know why that came up as number
like number one through ten but

350
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,390
i thought i was kinda funny

351
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,160
and another alternative

352
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,070
is to have one of those push to exit
signs

353
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,770
now use a combination where toward the
day

354
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,800
you have to

355
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,090
that you can trip the center opened or
maybe after powers

356
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,910
you can't walk in with a canadair to try
to open doors we have to push for fun

357
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,120
so you can play around with different
combinations depending on what the risk

358
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,270
is for your billing

359
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,580
are you really were about people
breaking in or not

360
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,020
you can't you can use a combination
response now of course make sure that

361
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,380
the bonds up in a place where

362
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,030
someone can treat you with a coat hanger
to push a button

363
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,430
if i have seen bro

364
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,360
garages and parking garages where you
can reach in around the gate press that

365
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,500
the bond opened the door

366
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,300
i wish i had picked picture of that

367
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,510
so indoors

368
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,820
every one of the door is adores your
first line of defense against someone

369
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:48,120
break into your office or break into a
datacenter or break into anything

370
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,430
just like without

371
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,040
who determines a lock pick village of
the clocks

372
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,559
sober those who are not raise your hand
expect to see everyone tomorrow

373
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,360
apple opic village

374
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,410
so just like the locks lose tolerances
with metal for from out different

375
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,730
through many poor manufacturing rates
elation can cause a bold abilities

376
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,030
the same with two or three of you and
stolid to war improperly or the times is

377
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,240
on the door

378
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,620
is really bad

379
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,710
that's just as good as per the do not
start sign you can get in very very

380
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,080
easily

381
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,769
so little atchison littles

382
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:27,269
but spring-loaded thing that keeps door
closer to what i see no if not idon't

383
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,940
know what planet you're from

384
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,830
and basically door latch operates since
its spring-loaded when you close that

385
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,760
door that ramp causes at the close

386
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,809
say at the door here

387
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:48,150
and then the wall war another towards up
double doors

388
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,330
of course you can take advantage of this

389
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,960
and just use of something whether it's a
piece of plastic or metal

390
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,630
to try to push on that lack to cause to
retract

391
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,130
so you have to do work here

392
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,450
the latch

393
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,250
sham

394
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,600
and a small hole here it is called the
latch whole oracle

395
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,440
or the ah...

396
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,720
the latch fright

397
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,960
ziggy that piece of metal here as well

398
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,990
protects the wall from where now

399
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,590
so years as a another example of fail

400
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:25,059
by i went on a daily status and review
because my company was uh... outsourcing

401
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:31,260
exercise to band

402
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,510
st

403
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,130
but myself

404
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,000
at this point

405
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
i'm satisfied

406
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,160
today

407
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,380
assassinated

408
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,130
patriots

409
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,380
headset

410
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,460
mister stuff

411
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,880
hypothesis does typac

412
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,100
aptitude test

413
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,410
past hypotheses

414
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:16,410
passover

415
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,100
so

416
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,049
that's it

417
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:43,049
but outside

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,750
this is the power systems for the party
it's on its own underfoot the switch off

419
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,770
per

420
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,770
and this is the case rommel every single
door iran until

421
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,340
so you what you would have to inspect
the other quality especially if you're

422
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,670
outsourcing make sure the vendor knows
what the heck they're doing

423
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,980
to me that the pilot the requirement to
stand her part and how biometrics

424
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,880
that was just a short walk through to
any executives they may be taking

425
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,320
towards on look at how secure in
high-tech at the sole yes

426
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,320
but really the low-tech stuff is going
to get your not the high-tech stuff

427
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,220
hoop so here's another picture

428
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,520
of another door

429
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,169
nice expanse of electrical actually
select the badge

430
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:29,480
an assault white releases this lacked
sleep and pull the door open

431
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,029
now this time the latches facing away
from me

432
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:40,029
but this time i got i'd have to take
some video

433
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,090
pat rockwell's use of a float that was

434
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,480
but so like he's like a really

435
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,920
lock picking tour

436
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,940
so it took a binder clip

437
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,120
to the binder clip

438
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,600
took it took apart

439
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,560
dispenser to move towards an l shaped

440
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,760
around behind the latch

441
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,820
and pull

442
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,630
both knows all those instances caribbean

443
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,990
mitigate it with a large part

444
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,640
which they suggest a piece of metal

445
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,680
a piece of metal that blocks the sham
from getting in

446
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,130
however going back the tolerance is a
manufacturing

447
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,690
at this latch strike relaxed hole

448
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,450
is to barge

449
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,140
you can actually pushed the door critic
captain and now you know usar flexible

450
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
sham

451
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,750
just to make around

452
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,779
and actually have a lot of them

453
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,200
myself over there but

454
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,200
you can use something like a piece of

455
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,790
me

456
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,510
so you can use a piece of plastic

457
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,719
this guest badge is probably flexible of
depending on how large sacked apus

458
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:13,480
mistake around the defense and the
pressure

459
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,960
and then a door jamb george and does the
same thing

460
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,240
sampled or billy if u

461
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,649
if there's a large enough gap

462
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:25,649
you can slip something in there

463
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,200
i'll show you in about their careers
could be an example yes

464
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,980
yes i'm gonna get so that a second

465
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,230
so how do you prevent latching there's
actually a type of latch

466
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,980
which is called a dead lakshmi

467
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,260
which is this little piece here you'll
sometimes sees some latches have the

468
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,190
some don't

469
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,600
if you have that that means is that

470
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,269
this is the deadlines

471
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:54,610
and what it does latched dawgs

472
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,289
is when that is the press

473
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,300
blacks will not be track unless you used
a candle

474
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,740
so the way deadlocked works and you
close the door

475
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,680
this lateral spring out but the dead
lack of state the press

476
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,240
when that is the press

477
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,900
even if you stick

478
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,680
shame in there

479
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,830
that lacks won't move if the line

480
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,159
the only way of getting that

481
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:21,220
lax retract issues the door handle

482
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,180
now you can still should the dead last
penny on the tolerance is at the door

483
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,840
if there isn't if tears

484
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,759
if the lapse

485
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:31,919
guard at work there's no whack on the
latter part of the black hawk match

486
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,520
cards to loose

487
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,990
you can actually hold the door towards
you just a little bit just go for the

488
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,700
dead last

489
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,290
pop out

490
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,220
and i know you can let you get shipment
just like a normal achche

491
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,880
that dead leftist never comes into play

492
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,010
now this is the vice combat

493
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,820
if it's something called in ensuing
laughed part which is active very nice

494
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,440
high security latch

495
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,240
flashcard

496
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,919
it's basic to strip the metal that is

497
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,560
one benefit both benton u_-shaped

498
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,690
this one here is bolted instead two-word
jam or the old bolted into the door

499
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,710
with this type of last forty two-year

500
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,100
there's no way you can

501
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,070
flexible shannon there

502
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,960
and of course they make models that are
maybe six inches long just to protect

503
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,490
the latch area but they also make one
sample before length of the door so this

504
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,950
is actually a very good laughed hard
help prevent shimmy even if you don't

505
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,750
have a that lacks this will work

506
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,090
as a protector doors

507
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,040
keep that in mind it if there's a door
where there's high-value assets back

508
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,630
there may want to consider that a
thought

509
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,250
if you were about tolerance is on the
door and this is pretty easy to retrofit

510
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,410
so esoteric out the wall

511
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,280
replacing the lap strike with something
with tighter tolerances units all that

512
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,200
your you're good

513
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,680
you're good to go

514
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,420
so here's another example

515
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,850
so this is actually tore jam

516
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,320
this is a door that has a dead lakshmana

517
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,940
and here's a

518
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,940
this of course that unknown building

519
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:19,049
so what i use that use another great
really cool toward thank

520
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,679
no basically all you walked around to
office

521
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,530
found they report had a plastic cover

522
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,030
and rip it off use that

523
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:32,419
so it's just something i found it laying
around in the office

524
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,820
as i mentioned the store how did that
lack

525
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,510
however

526
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,570
in this case

527
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,630
the latch strike was so wide

528
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,580
backbone that last completely useless

529
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,700
subgraph marketing

530
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,510
but right now

531
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,130
so that is inside so strong that got the
wrong dead latch

532
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,260
for the lack

533
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,409
separate this the wrong outlast right

534
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:58,529
so this does

535
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,019
to uh... laziness if your contractors
are not thinking things through and just

536
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:04,190
installed whatever

537
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,770
back to korea problem

538
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,320
and also

539
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,250
we see a huge gap

540
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:17,250
so end and make it hard for me is that
that piece of plastic in there

541
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,760
i think he pulled out my handle that

542
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,490
go back to so you can see it

543
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,220
if i don't have a picture

544
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,610
basically i put it in other angle

545
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,630
facing down tonight

546
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:38,850
hold it down but they said well i did
was it was not fancy

547
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,990
so here's another video of example of
that latch fail

548
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,029
that the that deviant up

549
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:48,180
unfortunately mac os x doesn't like the
kodak so i have to accept out to a

550
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:55,180
stated that you know

551
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,330
d_l_c_ likes it

552
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:05,330
just chino does not

553
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:14,720
this is an abandoned part of the hotel

554
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,740
and that's basic just a hawk

555
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,510
that was it

556
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:28,510
at the book

557
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,210
so now i want some bulk wait for a locks

558
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,940
because just because we for boxes so
pervasive in officers

559
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,030
that i did i just have to talk about it

560
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,210
wafer lots of really popular because
they're very cheap

561
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,600
and a very compact

562
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,330
so you can

563
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:54,340
their line-up location specially office
furniture accessed panels or anything of

564
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,820
the parcel

565
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,380
something that is a very wide

566
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,190
yes filing cabinets

567
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,310
things that you really you used to store
sensitive documentation which could be

568
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,520
confidential proprietary

569
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,330
or customer information

570
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,770
that's all it stored in there

571
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,590
now with

572
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,909
also with wafer locks because they're so
mass-producing sheet

573
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:17,990
of course they're gonna do

574
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,400
looser tolerances cheaper

575
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,700
wafer lots are very susceptible to
overheating attack

576
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,370
and if you have any questions about
breaking stoplights far up the uh...

577
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,559
locked that those will bolt we can do it

578
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,350
begitu demos and show you all that stuff

579
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,980
so instead of a penned stuck like greg
lookin tumbler locks you have these

580
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,710
metal wafers move up and down

581
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,780
edging out specialized tools for picking
those are not really picky pickings as

582
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,540
raking

583
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,519
caught trial keys article urs

584
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:49,719
debate there just flat piece of metal
with the regions where you apply tension

585
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:54,219
just jiggle it up and down to randomly
jostle those those uh... wafers in place

586
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:57,259
your your getaway buzzing the waterfront
garbage

587
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:59,400
trying to get to line up

588
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:06,400
so you can't turn

589
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,760
yes

590
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,920
however what they tried

591
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,620
could get one of the reco

592
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,029
however with a tryout g

593
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,470
its attention her and rate at the same
time so you really want at the

594
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,340
one-handed operation so you can have
your other guest

595
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:28,340
free to do something else whatever you
want whatever your fancy s

596
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,810
sod

597
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:39,810
that's you know everyone into all blacks
off by the people oxford

598
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,260
yes that is best that is a very good
point you can use any piece of metal

599
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:56,260
to jostle that arouse a give and had a
drink as well

600
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,870
so i mean your bank people rely on these
wait for locks

601
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:09,430
it's really terrill practice but some
people writer pattern post-it notes

602
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,860
and then rocket inside a filing uh...
cabinet with the way for locking dulwich

603
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,509
cure

604
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:16,389
a music here's a prime example that

605
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:18,080
deviant took a picture out

606
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,510
of someone with a post-it note with a
password locked inside a way for a long

607
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,790
up behind a a drawer will use wafer lot
well his drawers obviously open right

608
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:31,910
now so was not hard to get in

609
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,580
yeah maybe leave even he has the uh...
the used to tax on the inside the easy

610
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,649
access

611
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:37,630
and advice

612
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,730
both fresh pack on the outside world

613
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,630
exactly

614
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,680
operational efficiency

615
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,690
so there's another story so

616
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,840
we had a i've had a party at work

617
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,070
and someone brought a huge box of
cookies and they were leftovers after

618
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,299
the party so

619
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:01,900
i looked at my filing cabinet for as i
got sick or sacha copies for the next

620
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,910
day

621
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,860
walk on the next day i had left my badge
my keys at home

622
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,809
but i was damn sure i want those cookies

623
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:13,959
so basically i took

624
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,659
paper clip

625
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,579
and just any flat fees and i might have
happened have like a server one of

626
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:21,849
server keys that you walked like the
dell servers wet

627
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:26,179
are used as attention addition is that
this industry a paper cut

628
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,459
editor over lifting the taxing jiggling

629
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:37,459
analyst cookies were devour

630
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:39,939
taking out the trash so

631
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:43,769
most offices also have cleaning staff
back take out the trash

632
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:45,300
bumping into their opinion

633
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,779
to wear white whatever trash people do
with it take it outside

634
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:52,779
but maybe maybe should look more
carefully emi looks innocent summers

635
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:54,440
picking taking out the trash

636
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,269
but maybe should be careful where
they're taking that trash from

637
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:01,539
hoops yet indeed

638
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:05,529
this is basically a label saying there's
a lot of sensitive data in here as does

639
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:06,999
the label asking

640
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:09,749
telling him that his dating here to go
after

641
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:12,269
and what do they securities with

642
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:14,609
we for locks

643
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:16,859
so a cleaning staff

644
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:20,629
with a tryout teal or you know paper
clip that they find around knows that

645
00:35:20,629 --> 00:35:21,799
who those are just

646
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:23,769
jam something in there and twists

647
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,119
they could open back

648
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,959
so we need to be mindful about

649
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,579
so it all the things even think tr your
trash

650
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:32,829
one man's trash another fans are
golbright

651
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:36,499
so you'd be careful

652
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:38,869
here comes cameras

653
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:42,199
so obviously your security personnel
can't be

654
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:45,319
everywhere at the same time so that rely
on camera

655
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:49,249
to keep an eye on everything

656
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:56,249
first things you need to make sure that
got the coverage

657
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,009
i've been the facilities i mean not that
bad but

658
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,999
i think the phillies where

659
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:07,799
they don't have cameras facing every
single door

660
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:11,869
where you can almost plot out so if
someone like a cleaning person worry has

661
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,599
access to your bill we could start
scoping out understanding we are the

662
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,559
blind spot in your camera coverage it
may be a corner off after they of course

663
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,999
we have plenty to get into get into
everyone's office to pick up trash that

664
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:26,959
starts like that with offices are gonna
go through which route they're going to

665
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:32,599
take to bypass camera coverage

666
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,949
and then art as the d_l_c_ even reported

667
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:39,469
because sometimes that you can have a
security guy from watching

668
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:44,970
million st dot once meet some way of
going back to haiti i think that's right

669
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,489
last night

670
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:48,119
let's go back to that

671
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:55,119
but that is fine

672
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:01,929
as that

673
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:08,929
took this picture

674
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:17,529
so i can tell

675
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,089
stupid

676
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:24,679
sorry

677
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:31,679
hatch in cap-haitien

678
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,829
that

679
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:57,019
there is actually true

680
00:37:57,019 --> 00:37:59,049
miss clark

681
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:03,359
places people inside companies to get
access the buildings the steel

682
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,739
credit card information

683
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:08,189
gadgets or whatever it is so

684
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:11,429
do you are of cleaning staffer
third-party vendors get the same type of

685
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:15,519
scrutiny or background checks as your
employees they have the same access

686
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,089
physical access to the building

687
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:20,239
so recanted goat put them through the
same type of stringent

688
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,209
checks

689
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:25,869
and then especially the insider someone
who already has access to boost your

690
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,299
building

691
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:29,960
i mean the all those videos i took of me
walking around the building i have

692
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,390
access that bill if i may not have
particularly have access to rooms or

693
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,999
does two wars that i got in

694
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:37,880
it didn't this videos showed that

695
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,529
idea i was in the past was not
suspicious at all

696
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:45,319
especially if you pretend to know what
you're doing and that you belong there

697
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,779
that's a really important

698
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:51,039
who going back to social engineering

699
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,789
so in summary

700
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,509
use consistent policies and standards if
you could do one thing for executive

701
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:58,419
store

702
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,029
maybe should do it for another exacted
store

703
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:04,880
i've seen buildings where they are dead
latches on the c_f_o_ czar

704
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,790
office door

705
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,599
but not on the c_e_o_ that makes no
sense whatsoever

706
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,430
you have to have a consistent pop

707
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:15,279
wave doing things throughout the
building

708
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:18,089
and then late and then inspect
workmanship if you're hiring a

709
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,189
contractor to installed to work

710
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:23,069
you should know that you should have
someone in the house that knows how to

711
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,129
ballet type of work they do is good

712
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:30,699
i mean i i think is the group that does
the best picture for this

713
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:33,029
need to have some inspect the quality of
work

714
00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:36,390
if you have a third party it put their
party coming in to do some type of

715
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,579
intimidation or technology work

716
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,999
dot do you have some time to controls to
check

717
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:44,829
i'm sure most companies have control to
check to make sure that they're doing

718
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:47,939
quali job or my physical security
controls

719
00:39:47,939 --> 00:39:53,229
that should follow the same stringent
review as anything else

720
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:56,699
alleges executing georgians and common
sense someone

721
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:00,499
is doing something suspicious or doesn't
have a bad to visit is able to prove

722
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:04,119
that they belong there doesn't matter
how smooth talking the are you meet the

723
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,019
challenge of verifying

724
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:12,429
they belong there are they should be
doing what they're doing

725
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:16,699
so i want to thank everyone if you have
any more any questions feel free to find

726
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:18,619
