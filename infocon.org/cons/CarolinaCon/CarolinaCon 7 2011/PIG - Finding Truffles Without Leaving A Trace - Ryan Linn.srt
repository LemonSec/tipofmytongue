1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,120
unjustly

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,910
of uh...

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:14,910
abuse me

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,730
so i've been giving

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,849
for the last

6
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:27,159
so com to

7
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,429
of people who were concerned about

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,120
ticked this

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,980
this would be curls

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,980
and uh... i think it gives it a little

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,880
victory it does

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,760
uh... and so that this is

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,760
finding truffles without a trace

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,190
arm so

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,010
that about

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,110
who i am i why we're here

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,580
non-policy

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,259
i don't

19
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:11,290
like slides very much

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,490
so i'm good

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,380
all that

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,900
a little bit about how all the possible

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,870
for help to read

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,870
and then

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,790
complicating

26
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,790
how to treat them as a state so a decent
opening

27
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,600
i will be talking about possibly

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,830
are gathering

29
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:54,830
a lot of the time we need

30
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,410
moltedo

31
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,570
and other sort of

32
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,690
find information about you on the web

33
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:09,690
uh... and

34
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,879
the concept behind

35
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,879
so you arrive on the network

36
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:33,909
i'm not talking about so

37
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:36,809
the sickest

38
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:39,409
what packets

39
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,829
disputing i came here

40
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:46,699
so riddled with about

41
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:53,699
synopsis planning char

42
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,529
and how we can look a little bit about

43
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:01,309
different types of packets

44
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:03,889
and figure out what they are

45
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,969
uh... we can take the

46
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:10,519
so we're also going to

47
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,719
things though

48
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,959
in a way that this came about this

49
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,909
i was trying to figure out why something
else

50
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,059
idea

51
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:24,289
whatsoever

52
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,650
started watching some of the stuff

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,499
and some of the glove really interesting

54
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:31,249
and so just by me being on the network

55
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:35,729
worsening the stuff that wasn't stuff

56
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:36,959
no public

57
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,749
gipp was running dropbox

58
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:39,779
stuff like that

59
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:42,559
but yet there are some needs munich

60
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,719
what did you figure out

61
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,229
so we can figure out

62
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,549
for the nice part about this is asking
for

63
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,810
office and he can help

64
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,809
expect

65
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,540
you just have to be part of the network

66
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,779
so this is all stuff

67
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:04,779
your corporate network

68
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:07,839
they can get back to me

69
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,619
network dot should be i'd guess answers

70
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,989
unit drop in to your days

71
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,319
custom out where this is just by nature
of someone

72
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,380
weatherby plugging

73
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:27,380
or sitting outside starbucks

74
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,360
there's a lot of reason to be here

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,319
just woke up in that race

76
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,089
i've done that yet

77
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,079
but uh...

78
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:43,079
that could be packet parsing

79
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,560
there's a lot more people

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,830
could have heard about things

81
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:03,830
but we are to be talking about stuff

82
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,539
supersede segments

83
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,909
estimates are you what kind of drug
addiction

84
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,049
and maybe how you don't

85
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:16,049
squat down properly

86
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,689
and pastors abuses and for me

87
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,659
but for everybody

88
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,229
if you go to the airport

89
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,119
you know anyone

90
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:33,249
you probably want to know what kind of
traffic you're sending

91
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,469
so we're going to be talking about how
upset

92
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,069
to look at the scene

93
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:44,069
using metis which was capture stuff

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,560
quickly within three packets

95
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,270
almost wednesday based business

96
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,190
necessarily

97
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,110
for sports output

98
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,479
extremely functional

99
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,889
stupid reversal

100
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:10,090
investors suffering

101
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,930
with database

102
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,599
seven there

103
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,870
anymore people

104
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,869
also uh...

105
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,080
you don't want to be sending

106
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,080
out of the stuff out

107
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,949
unsettle

108
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:35,919
slides so we're gonna do hate uh...

109
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,789
four gallon traffic

110
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:42,399
and we can ensure that the greatest

111
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,989
women talk about

112
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:48,330
which is the pump

113
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,330
obviously other thing is

114
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,610
uh... if you have something that

115
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,710
was rolling one ad

116
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,309
a little bit short soon

117
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:17,309
and it wasn't until now

118
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,620
it is not uh... appropriate

119
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,870
so i guess them

120
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,090
the other thing i want

121
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,150
we're going to you

122
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,569
of this information

123
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:43,569
bombard

124
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,030
a living around

125
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:12,569
they capture the flag

126
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:15,119
so one of the things we will be looking
at it

127
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,439
were playing option

128
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,509
one commissioner

129
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,259
modestly

130
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:28,499
keep us posted at spots now by default

131
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:33,380
buskers database

132
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:40,380
when richard bliss was developed

133
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,810
you want to

134
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,340
discrete your dvd

135
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:56,340
uh... we heard it created a user
cold-blooded mess-up

136
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,970
would she do

137
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,820
creature myself

138
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,210
your creativity

139
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,280
he will have everything you need

140
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,000
surgery doing this as a real

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,080
a lot of other

142
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,840
slipping stuff

143
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,990
the other thing is is sick

144
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,780
here can be running mate

145
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,320
can be interesting

146
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,860
that's uh... start let's wait

147
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,020
appeared in her see file

148
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,600
and what this is going to do system

149
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,640
but the xml rpc module which drew this
is going to be

150
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,710
the data album

151
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,330
uh... we're serving the password

152
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,660
then we're setting the date itself so
that they will use postgres

153
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,480
gear connecting through

154
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,540
we start modestly were

155
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,830
to see if initialize the database

156
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:02,310
bring all of our

157
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,520
so how many people here needs met as
well

158
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,990
that so that number

159
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,550
for those of you haven't noticed would

160
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:15,260
history

161
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:22,260
information

162
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:30,400
annex was featured

163
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,660
uh... notice was already has stopped

164
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,900
uh... captures sniffer

165
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,320
you have or database

166
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,040
verify there's nothing in it

167
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,040
and so great now it isn't

168
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,700
it is indeed to retreat

169
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,420
understood for

170
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:06,350
this is not yet

171
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,030
a list of upper

172
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:15,030
so confused myself personally

173
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,330
we're going to disney

174
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:29,330
sparked up i'll they capture earlier

175
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,010
sort what u severed pick-up file

176
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,880
cc topeka

177
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,270
so the nice part about noticeable

178
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,210
between his party

179
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,420
bipartisan is when you go on top of them
sometimes it's bad

180
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:06,420
thurs of the spartans variable that has
to be set

181
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,780
yes you can get a slide

182
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,810
well-disciplined again and see if it
means

183
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:27,810
x what might be in

184
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:43,300
uh... we could be this home

185
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:56,510
okay so we're going to start off by

186
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,990
listener interface

187
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:09,990
and then we just

188
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,510
so it artwork

189
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,590
models for speech one of these is a
different type of

190
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,500
and so now

191
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,480
uh... we're seeing

192
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,170
cnb n ask which can be in essence

193
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,970
this multitask units

194
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,740
it helps

195
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,760
immense talent

196
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,760
gives away quite a bit

197
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,560
it did request pcp

198
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,480
right so i have

199
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,320
just requested

200
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,390
so if i didn't want to request ninety
address

201
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,370
really have to

202
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,660
obvious vittu

203
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,920
taking he zero

204
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,760
uh... if i wanted to justice issue with
the access point

205
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,860
unique pageviews talented

206
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,790
you still see me on your access point

207
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,120
since i'd associated with

208
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,600
but i wouldn't have sent out packets
outside

209
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,780
didn't seem to be secure what's coming
in

210
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,490
armed indiana's

211
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,250
another problem

212
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,970
so we can see from the information

213
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,830
gathered so far

214
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,510
possess a gun in the background

215
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:44,510
that we have those public make matters
connected

216
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,450
we have some time

217
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,580
pcp

218
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,330
about so one of the first

219
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,740
arsenault stuff

220
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,740
we go ahead

221
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,160
so this is an admission that i'd rather
earlier

222
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,710
so you can see here we've got products

223
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,560
outside the city

224
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,960
there's actually an appeal

225
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,250
west of here

226
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:27,250
so we can see traditional boats that
were found

227
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,740
additional services

228
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,900
mention as well so these are all of the
boards that were discovered

229
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,090
just by listening

230
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,870
compostela

231
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:43,870
discovered in all of us is

232
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,650
break so all of this

233
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,360
basically i'm dropping everything here
that is

234
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,020
broadcaster multitask

235
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,870
um... there's a couple things

236
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,300
fall into their

237
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,110
botanically

238
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:12,110
cisco discovery protocol

239
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,250
but everything over

240
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,750
here is just broadcast multicast traffic

241
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,620
so we haven't

242
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,590
i guess what other things

243
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,820
all you see a lot of spin

244
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,170
out there about products

245
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,510
well that's on their designed to city
trip

246
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,100
where you can spend

247
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,690
so we have no additional access here

248
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,550
we haven't done any sort of injection

249
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,120
in order to be able to

250
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,290
or anything like that great distance

251
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,350
requests a mac address will be broadcast

252
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,660
this is all traffic

253
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,780
so if you want to participate

254
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:58,780
agency

255
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,710
there's a couple of thing

256
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,530
statements were truck

257
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,790
each other posts

258
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,320
sports covered it at school

259
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,330
keeps track of services

260
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,510
and armed services related to her

261
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,570
uh... if you're interested

262
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,840
more about what services

263
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,350
services people

264
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,030
or age-specific

265
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,650
no experience

266
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,659
uh... it's basically

267
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:34,460
for work and other data

268
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,440
midsection

269
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,510
that doesn't volunteering services a
bomber building

270
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,860
a password

271
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,160
or eight feet

272
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,160
decency all of these or physically

273
00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:00,820
and

274
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,039
them multitask

275
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:11,540
that is one of the things that helps us
public service

276
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,190
so i think so now we have some

277
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,360
really kind of sucks tool

278
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,860
expecially is

279
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,830
so income stratus

280
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,080
operation stratus

281
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,440
its intricacies of talking

282
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
what treatises

283
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,950
sports keeping track

284
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,750
uh... services in all of the southern

285
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,030
egalitarian and so we can point net such
results

286
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,020
we can't pulling him up results and we
can

287
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,790
together all of us

288
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,409
to create a single source wary

289
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:53,730
uh... traders is real tough

290
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,860
which is uh...

291
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,610
really not very suitable for

292
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,240
uh... as a recipient

293
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,810
there may not

294
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,570
since we're using

295
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,340
denied a sport package jagged person

296
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,249
you can actually richer

297
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:17,030
ivonne strips or

298
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,050
predicted his first

299
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,280
and so when i'm pulling apart

300
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,710
it's like a cd key

301
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,230
when her for that

302
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,380
and prosecutor ticket

303
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,460
so our trade issues is a concept

304
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,789
escape rials

305
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,710
a program which will let us do it

306
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,890
a number of different

307
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,060
sorry thor lewis

308
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,400
so we are going to be late for work

309
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,470
distro

310
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:03,470
goes and sits up as a software

311
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:24,750
now we have

312
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,670
configuration

313
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,830
under this

314
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,990
m_s_f_

315
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,950
on port five five five five three

316
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,510
because i thought that the relentless up

317
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,000
uh... i set my prospered

318
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
some setbacks

319
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,330
seemed unperturbed

320
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:13,820
importance of all

321
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,100
to do this majesty

322
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,710
so this war what needs to be messed with
it it's

323
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,640
such all of you

324
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,640
adela could replace it

325
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:47,560
packets so

326
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,630
o'dell a signal

327
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,010
while i was playing around with the
stuff of looking at what might

328
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,420
was sending out

329
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,860
and so

330
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,299
when you get your

331
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,080
is really awesome

332
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,360
what you mean what you need

333
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,460
so then you go out and

334
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,060
it tells everyone everywhere you go

335
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,140
who you are

336
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,960
if you're looking at starbucks or
whatever

337
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,300
testing itself

338
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,360
it's really creepy disco

339
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,570
hi christopher to the person who is
sitting

340
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,110
marianna browsing

341
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:41,110
i don't know if that's talking about

342
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:55,970
so that is uh...

343
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,730
on george carson

344
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,130
multi casting stop

345
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,410
onshore disposal

346
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:20,410
telling you he could still high kids

347
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,960
testing and stuff

348
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,050
using a mac you want to be able to
figure out where everybody's life

349
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,130
more interesting stuff fairly feathers
of presents but

350
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,510
so if you want to know if somebody's
actually in front of them back

351
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,100
as it's before that

352
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,900
which is a special useful for kind of
thing because if you're going to spill

353
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,420
or something

354
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,030
or whatever your message

355
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,890
uh... so

356
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:01,270
book that's been asked also getaways

357
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,999
look at me

358
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:06,040
use all my porch there

359
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:13,040
expotv haha

360
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:27,500
michael buble

361
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:34,500
information certainly

362
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,650
and so we can see now

363
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:44,650
that was that we'd see talked about
earlier there

364
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,390
specific information

365
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,860
this is a very hopeful so for almost all
these election we have to double

366
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:01,860
so you can see when we saw all the votes

367
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,680
these others

368
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:14,680
testing and stuff

369
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,530
certificate

370
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:26,530
we concede that

371
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,550
reports in that sense

372
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:45,550
so off

373
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,630
and that is what yet

374
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,770
so if you send

375
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:57,770
uh... work properly formed in one place
and manner to scrap somewhere else

376
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,620
so which was uh...

377
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,580
what this is from

378
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:08,580
meeting effective

379
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,460
base off

380
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:42,460
when this broadcast stuff

381
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,930
he drove the name of the speaker of the
debate

382
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:54,930
a lot of other

383
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,030
so this is kind of neat

384
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,290
compasses uh...

385
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,830
one xbox

386
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,050
got a couple of days

387
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,590
uh... it's got a network

388
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,280
properly label

389
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,730
probably go undiscovered

390
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,080
something would suit you detector or

391
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,160
aside the printer and somebody or think
that it's it's

392
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:27,240
fredericks essary

393
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:34,240
et

394
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,560
will prolly noticed what your schedule

395
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,710
so long with the wireless adapter you
can

396
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,799
won his value

397
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:51,799
pre-med esplanade

398
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,830
live broadcast that out

399
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,110
threatening to it

400
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,290
or cheap

401
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,680
behind a couch

402
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,300
pompey watch which i did talk about it

403
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,910
so it will try to tell you

404
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,690
or uh... s_s_-eighteen's

405
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,920
h_t_t_p_

406
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,029
peace to keep u_s_

407
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,530
d_m_s_

408
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,480
fallback icm

409
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,840
so if there's a packet typing

410
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,409
uh... the still find it

411
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,149
uh...

412
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:25,590
all this stuff escaped

413
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,220
on this

414
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,970
comes into play is uh... if you don't
and that's

415
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,750
or if you're trying to prevent or
something like

416
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:40,750
you read about some back taxes

417
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,970
size of things

418
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,289
his beloved smaller

419
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:46,930
and they actually have

420
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,140
an additional wireless capability

421
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,130
so you can have something that is
sitting there sniffing wireless

422
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,410
his tunnel back

423
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,850
over three g

424
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:02,220
back to the attacker

425
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,930
because they were selling this stuff it
is

426
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,319
the minicomputer you can get

427
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,660
not one of us

428
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,150
but the guys that uh... the

429
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,570
pony express

430
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,919
v_w_ ninety-eight express

431
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,260
are so we need to lose

432
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:23,200
basically and testing

433
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,710
um... it depends upon

434
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:31,269
the president's on

435
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,560
hockey

436
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,250
or something like two hundred eighty
bucks

437
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,159
three team

438
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,820
i think it's uh... up to fifty

439
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,580
fairly recently

440
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,920
for from investors a lot of it

441
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,650
they're actually something

442
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,830
because it's expenses

443
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,730
answer the same type of technology

444
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:04,870
to talk back

445
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,360
so this is sort of uh... watch

446
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,540
this is the concord

447
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,080
and it is by far

448
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,080
pony express pic of you

449
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:23,650
bledsoe

450
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,790
wants information simple

451
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,360
you can manage it off

452
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,430
competition

453
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,590
different other things

454
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:37,830
you can import

455
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,200
vocally

456
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,630
pham doan cdv

457
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,950
even important

458
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:50,950
types of files

459
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,889
vishal two different types of file so

460
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,160
for necessary expo

461
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,050
i mean bailed him out

462
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,290
uh... as most of the three f

463
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,180
so you can

464
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:13,710
or all of your contest information

465
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,980
the solidity

466
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,250
profile for clothes

467
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:23,250
and figure out all the information about
it was based off your stuff

468
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,430
how does this work

469
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,830
this is uh...

470
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,450
and that's what's going on

471
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,910
feeney sniffers

472
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,830
speaks of a rich never

473
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,050
packets

474
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,900
it has a series of copper filters

475
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,350
we can take a quick

476
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,350
october filters

477
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,430
as i said

478
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:06,430
these are wounded automatically

479
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,539
inside the mostly directory

480
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,600
versus data

481
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,930
also prefer it

482
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,119
that's full all

483
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,770
all sorts of things

484
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,259
metastable uses for the thing

485
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:20,380
but it does

486
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,070
so if we look at exploits

487
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,299
under

488
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:27,210
there's all of these different files

489
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,979
so it's you had a new protocol

490
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:30,250
digital with that

491
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,190
you create one of these capture files
and you just dropped

492
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,660
so these are all

493
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,230
outlook at right now

494
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,380
uh... one of the things that we do to
help speed up the capture because in

495
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,440
some places

496
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,950
redistributed

497
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,809
is weak

498
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,330
uh... system specifications

499
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,080
for what types of

500
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,460
he won't be looking at

501
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,460
so

502
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,740
the registrar

503
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,990
uh... the size

504
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,189
the criteria are

505
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:05,189
or being able to you

506
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,649
parse method

507
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:09,430
accepts a packet

508
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,130
uses uh... racket

509
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,050
which is the packet manipulation

510
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:23,050
looted in medicine

511
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,710
basically this is the

512
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,690
the breakdowns

513
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,790
end of the day

514
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,030
so if there's another staffer

515
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,710
believes that you find it interesting

516
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,390
you want to add

517
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,620
and back in a different way

518
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,980
report no point in our audience is with
us

519
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,190
in order to

520
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,779
building b one of these

521
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:56,779
basically what you have to do

522
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,049
uh... the

523
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:01,169
uh... system of the work

524
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,139
and then

525
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:02,940
artist

526
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,340
the second portion is out whatever of
the protocol is

527
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,200
we have a pic

528
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,969
parser plots asshole

529
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:16,690
that's already built

530
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,019
and all of the status on

531
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:20,219
my subversion repository

532
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,829
uh... it's future tested

533
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:29,009
racket israel document

534
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:31,849
uses it doesn't support

535
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:38,209
so actually had to

536
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,220
is also not

537
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,809
completely

538
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:43,919
notifiable

539
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,999
so if you're looking at some sort of
traffic

540
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:53,999
relieves here and be in israel

541
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:06,739
so these are the currently supported
filters

542
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:10,229
insisted discovered critical his designs

543
00:35:10,229 --> 00:35:14,849
you figure out what your infrastructure
isn't aids

544
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:19,299
so uh... that triple talks back and
forth between sister devices

545
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:20,419
i'll let you know

546
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:22,849
what switches

547
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:23,939
but there are less than

548
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:27,140
capabilities are so we can figure out
the less version unki address

549
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,359
information

550
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,099
palm in most cases the linen

551
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,379
on management information

552
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:36,949
all the other stuff

553
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,420
overalls as uh...

554
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,609
it's pretty good

555
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:44,189
so short lesson a little less for it

556
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:47,579
on the i_p_o_ address

557
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,819
so we can know what it's interface at
the addresses are

558
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,999
but more importantly what its management

559
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:55,609
so if you actually have a company

560
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,679
protected their management

561
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,690
you can know what network

562
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,729
need to get on to you

563
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:08,029
felim information is and trust up was
the right people

564
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:10,119
all more more common enterprises

565
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,559
and uh... a lot of the time

566
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,039
really nice about

567
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,649
that was a pretty

568
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:20,539
and that makes

569
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:21,460
because at that point

570
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,489
you know this was just talking cbp

571
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:25,319
you start talking c

572
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:27,029
and uh... you say hey

573
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:28,029
cisco four

574
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:30,999
in the logo

575
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:35,239
and so then you're on the

576
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,069
basically

577
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,499
uh... he gives away a whole lot of them

578
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:41,549
the way that you have protected the
switch

579
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:44,099
well as

580
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,349
hardware and what elestra

581
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,989
to give you a little bit better

582
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:52,130
dac people

583
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,039
worker and trust

584
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:58,399
omg you may not see the requesting you
may not see that

585
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:02,059
but a lot of time

586
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:05,489
and so this is another one one time to
finish at all

587
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,679
but it was not the mac address was named
underclass request

588
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,869
deep into pasta request list

589
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:14,519
woman to be able to use

590
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,530
to be able to figure out

591
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,239
uh... what specific

592
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:22,139
operating system

593
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,200
you can use this

594
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,279
steve just based off

595
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:26,410
pcb traffic

596
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:33,410
what all that stuff

597
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:36,600
so drop boxes coming

598
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,618
uh... entrusting

599
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:43,519
it really wants to talk to its friends

600
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,679
caring and sharing

601
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,130
go head and tell you it is

602
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,119
dropbox

603
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,070
he wants to make sure that

604
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,499
you know with the person

605
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:55,679
so if there's ever dropbox

606
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,509
picked flexibility equally

607
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:03,419
fisher teams businesses dressing that
was uh... recent conversation

608
00:38:03,419 --> 00:38:04,570
uh... an expat whereas

609
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,380
you can acquire someone

610
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,559
for dropbox

611
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,829
you have access to their files

612
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:11,880
there's a concept of

613
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,019
privilege escalation

614
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:20,019
you get in and a certain level

615
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:24,049
and it's essentially dinner of

616
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:26,879
to drop box tells you what needs fixing

617
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:30,459
to say you see the c_i_o_

618
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:35,719
listening to speeches in use

619
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:38,359
every protocol

620
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,099
you can go ahead and say

621
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:40,899
since you guys

622
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,179
synod scene in space

623
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:45,059
eager to be need here

624
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:51,549
gained access to that statement

625
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:52,899
kind of interesting

626
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:53,720
except or

627
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,359
since you have access to

628
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,419
better way to do so someone

629
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:02,549
dropping email

630
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,869
and said hey decided something

631
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:04,919
the drop box

632
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,239
can you check it out

633
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:12,389
and citibank

634
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:15,099
so while it is not

635
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:22,099
directly

636
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:27,789
group which is

637
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:29,499
up like that

638
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:31,839
is are designed so

639
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:32,930
uh... you can view

640
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:37,329
peer to peer sharing

641
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:40,919
office talking

642
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:44,859
it tells you simple stuff it so see
whether or not

643
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:46,269
as online offline

644
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:48,979
was just as the software something that
doesn't mean

645
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:51,889
directly log

646
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,189
so that they'll tell you whether or not

647
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:58,799
the really interesting one

648
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:01,229
for some reason it feels the need to

649
00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:03,959
every night the address that

650
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,859
so why is that interest

651
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:11,369
so say you were on this network

652
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:14,099
are also note

653
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,949
solicitation software

654
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,849
odd if your you're pretty

655
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:25,859
any of this sort of thing

656
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:30,679
to gain additional

657
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,509
and it also tells the first

658
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:34,770
urgent of reform of all we can

659
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,779
figure mission of the stuff that

660
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:41,439
the other interesting

661
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,219
so also know what office person you're
running

662
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:47,179
so if there's a new theory

663
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:47,870
office

664
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,599
two thousand seven

665
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,929
two thousand seven

666
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:55,979
you're now target for social

667
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:58,059
arm and gymnasts

668
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:02,209
wanna talk about

669
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:02,900
but they don't

670
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,589
we'd understand

671
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:06,239
apple feels

672
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,079
hops and other

673
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,079
i'm not sure how back convened

674
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:20,179
it's designed

675
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,299
and service discovery on the network
service

676
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:24,060
nancy pierce that you can talk

677
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,459
and whether they be as a saint servers
gateways separate

678
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:31,449
kalispell appearances

679
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:34,519
the status information he will give up
people's names

680
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:37,309
all whether or not the right

681
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:38,859
uh... and other available

682
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:40,769
uh... functionalities

683
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:41,879
printers are using

684
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:46,609
indian has a lot more now seventy

685
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:48,829
some of the printer stuff is fascinating

686
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:53,129
and figure out everything

687
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:55,179
server your elders

688
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:59,299
out whether or not it's protected
whether or not it has a stapler

689
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:00,739
piercing piercing

690
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:03,949
want to go on a state when spring

691
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:07,359
oh all of that sort of information

692
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,699
non-durable formatted

693
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:16,699
said that uh... he imploded

694
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:20,170
ambien us also

695
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,179
chair huh

696
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:26,829
underestimate

697
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:28,349
can also use ratings

698
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:35,349
so as your profile you network t_v_ gain
additional

699
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:39,189
s_n_p_

700
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,789
this is going on for forever

701
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:43,229
this is the result

702
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:44,599
net bias

703
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:47,489
and so yes or no purpose to less version

704
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:50,949
uh... whether or not it has for children

705
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:53,699
so whether or not the server services
started

706
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:57,899
and whether or not the workstation
services started

707
00:42:57,899 --> 00:42:59,179
and demanded

708
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,100
and what this becomes

709
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,869
will be his supporters for some reason

710
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:04,579
i guess fiscal server got included

711
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:05,850
and this list so

712
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,750
of microsoft

713
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,269
really want you know

714
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:10,119
broadcast it out on the network

715
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:12,749
when you're running a sequel server

716
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:14,309
so if you're looking

717
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:15,619
for awake in

718
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:20,199
well the tummy microsoft developer
network siebel server

719
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,309
so if you just

720
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:22,210
sit and listen

721
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,369
you may have

722
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:26,689
distilled listed attack vectors come to
you and go page

723
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,469
breaking the meeting

724
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:35,469
armies of investors

725
00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:00,809
certainly store

726
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:01,890
the broadcast packet

727
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,189
yes the actual pwd occurred

728
00:44:04,189 --> 00:44:05,749
as ass'n v v two

729
00:44:05,749 --> 00:44:07,839
and i haven't looked at them and
supporters

730
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,249
msnbc t parsers

731
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,209
you with us and easy to use your
dealings

732
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:18,019
challenged responses as part of that
negotiation

733
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:20,249
as far as the broadcast packets ghetto

734
00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:21,020
since you're just

735
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,449
screaming cable t_v_

736
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:29,449
there's no need for

737
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:33,379
so as a sticky

738
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:38,429
which is better known as network
plug-and-play 'cause absent

739
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:39,459
so that i guess that's

740
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:41,919
another one i find very intriguing

741
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:44,709
it's easy to discover printers

742
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:47,150
persons in the security cameras uh...

743
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,469
are always talking

744
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:50,589
never believe what

745
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:52,270
so if you're listening on the network

746
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,119
always suddenly start seeing

747
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,769
armies packets for me

748
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:59,069
this plea the capital

749
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:02,529
morrell find out more

750
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:05,799
unnatural to find out more three vehicle

751
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:07,400
uh... with the cameras more weeds

752
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,509
he tell you where else

753
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,899
in this sort of uh...

754
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:18,089
for printers it's its way to get him

755
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:19,609
also printer function

756
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:22,449
on personnel

757
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:25,629
so you get all of this information

758
00:45:25,629 --> 00:45:28,119
omg it weighs

759
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:31,389
in addition to

760
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:33,459
while the times people's side

761
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:34,519
desk now

762
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:38,509
have some of the state

763
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:40,929
if it has a network for quantum when

764
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:47,519
so i mean you could maybe even be
watching that somebody at the desk

765
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,359
but it should selling it's entirely
moral

766
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,519
all conceded a world

767
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:55,619
all big cities

768
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,220
usually the operating system that's
running

769
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:05,220
what is people these are the world's
manager

770
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:10,039
uh... what the times security cameras

771
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:17,039
secured so if you're on the network

772
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,189
uh... we've gone through a bunch of
stuff so how do we fix it

773
00:46:22,189 --> 00:46:25,019
never has a pretty sleepy

774
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,930
which most of the time

775
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,200
not really meaning that anymore

776
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,219
need to use your files

777
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:33,989
you can go directly to their

778
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:35,869
you don't need to discover the

779
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:42,869
spot for network system maintenance

780
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:50,269
or both systems discipline by asserting
cpa

781
00:46:50,299 --> 00:46:51,579
assisted he would

782
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:56,049
or put in place

783
00:46:56,049 --> 00:47:03,049
i guess if you put him somewhere in the
gateway is

784
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:06,049
but in most cases

785
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:09,149
seetickets itself would because a lot of
network admins

786
00:47:09,149 --> 00:47:11,199
well cv

787
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,119
where they connect first off

788
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,599
chelsea t_v_ neighbors

789
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:17,299
and intelligent

790
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:24,079
on the state's devices you go

791
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:29,619
uncertain of the office devices

792
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:30,919
thirty eight c p

793
00:47:30,919 --> 00:47:34,199
there's a concept a d_n_c_ people purse

794
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,459
with these helpers to

795
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:36,819
twenty eight sixty

796
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:38,109
let's proceed

797
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:40,939
oddities people person

798
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:42,109
other network

799
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,929
my pcp servers over here you don't need
this

800
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,679
everybody

801
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:48,829
and returning on peace

802
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:52,519
a lot of them broadcast

803
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:59,519
obviously takes integration

804
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:01,829
suffered robots

805
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:04,009
discipline land sink

806
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:05,009
will stop you from

807
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:07,229
broadcasting out

808
00:48:07,229 --> 00:48:11,309
about information

809
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:13,099
this tobacco shop product

810
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,449
making stopping

811
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:17,809
i haven't found a way

812
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:23,599
you find a way

813
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,039
and it's all certainly would be affected

814
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,419
it is a microsoft product so it may be

815
00:48:30,419 --> 00:48:33,089
reinstall the next batch

816
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:35,759
and then have been asked by

817
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:41,589
some aspect of it

818
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:45,619
that it's obviously

819
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:48,099
step one is when you get your
by-products

820
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:51,449
change the name

821
00:48:51,449 --> 00:48:52,329
if you don't need it

822
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:59,299
there's checkboxes

823
00:48:59,299 --> 00:49:05,989
they may not always be an option to
actually come at all

824
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:12,989
so how to help

825
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:14,089
cast traffic

826
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:16,239
which if you need to see if you don't

827
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,259
makes it easy as you can say for the
filter broadcast or multi cast

828
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:28,259
and so that way you really can't read
stuff

829
00:49:29,379 --> 00:49:30,279
that could be visible

830
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:32,920
we billable but there's tables out there

831
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,599
a stupid stuff

832
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:39,559
do you see people perished

833
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,469
and also if you

834
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:44,869
on housing packet capture zone

835
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:48,289
technical briefing

836
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:55,289
and if you do it within the protocols
gonna figure out how to act

837
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:57,579
uh... in the future

838
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:00,049
what i

839
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:01,609
uh... defcon

840
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:08,609
because havoc with their batons

841
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:15,569
uh... i want to try to get some

842
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:17,639
which this functionality directly al

843
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:24,639
so too much that

844
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:27,589
uh... better less ideas coming

845
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:31,229
or protocols

846
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:33,289
i'm going to be ready to help
replications

847
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:36,079
person the stuff evening

848
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:36,789
off but i'm

849
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:37,569
release of

850
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:42,449
python scripts for the hopefuls tougher
if we had it not

851
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:47,179
votes polled

852
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:53,419
senate request

853
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:53,939
thank you
