1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,010
ears

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,359
matt microphone again

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:13,169
are a lot about your partner artifacts
carolina time

4
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:14,970
privilege to be here and i was able to
get out

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,219
i like talking about

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,449
tells her about crypto

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,350
are no script charter fee for a living

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,160
none of us really has a script auger
field yeah for you

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,160
right

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,580
said

11
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,580
statistic that the system

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,900
it's real

13
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,720
four basic types of crypto systems i
want to talk about to hear

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,150
is transposition cypress which means

15
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,880
you moved things around

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,420
substitution cypress which major plate
replace one thing with another pretty

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,330
straightforward

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,159
product exponentially since i think you
need advanced math degree four

19
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,880
little bitty one-hour talk we're not
gonna get into that

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,510
but if you want it's out there

21
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,750
transposition

22
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,590
the basic moves what does it look like

23
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,939
but said we got a message

24
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,670
attack at dawn

25
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,520
sold it was not go ahead and will
populate a little bird

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,399
with the message

27
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,080
and so it's going to read have

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,150
little indices simply what sir ki

29
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,069
what's a good cabey's picks up aba one
two three four

30
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:04,840
just grabbed all the first come down the
second on the third on the fourth

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,479
and here you go you get a message

32
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,419
a cv take eighty w a t a

33
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,759
transport right

34
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,389
never than not the fed sure it's ill
bring that about any particular dept dot

35
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:16,859
that's what it adult e_p_a_ chief at the
gate

36
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:21,279
people walk right what is it starts like
a lot of the other way

37
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,329
i'll out everybody's bright out there

38
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:27,389
if you change you can guess what you get
a little bit different set tea cake a_t_

39
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,770
and t_ a_ w_ a_ c_

40
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,300
what do you notice about the site for
text

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,009
and the plain text

42
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:36,449
do the same letters

43
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:39,779
beer you're going to find that the
frequency

44
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:43,189
of the most common letters that are in
your plane tax are gonna be the same

45
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:45,859
frequency there in your site for text

46
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:48,029
the most common lettered english
languages

47
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:51,250
he ci hehehe all harris okay

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,110
like by about biker bar and i bought a
viable or any just go ahead and just use

49
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,609
those concepts

50
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,419
and see why she's t_v_ game shows
actually were you're supposed to use

51
00:02:59,419 --> 00:02:59,980
them

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,119
because every language has a different

53
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:05,519
sequence of letters and if you got to
the point

54
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,069
we had the same number of every single
letter

55
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,220
white boys right

56
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,540
is no way you can look at it and see the
difference she should

57
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,309
or some such oceanside for this has been
around for a long long time

58
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:22,329
ever heard of a guy but i'm a julius
caesar

59
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,420
so what's easier ciphers work

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,339
is something they'll used

61
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,079
over two thousand years ago because back
then first of all by nineteen ninety

62
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,429
percent of people were literate anyway

63
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:36,239
and then if you want it is scrambling to
just a little bit

64
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,229
airline preceptor like totally duped as
well so you really didn't need to really

65
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:45,139
solid seifert so what he did for descrip
carter first it is a civil take all the

66
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:48,689
letters were going to shift them three
places click click click and now what

67
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,819
we're going to do is realistic first
three sticking at the end and out baby

68
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,969
comes v

69
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,840
bb com cc becomes at devika sheets after
okay

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,450
make about your letters is that there
are a big real

71
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,469
he just click click click click the
captain crunch decoder ring

72
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:05,120
no not

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,409
like the captain crunch

74
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,339
so different

75
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:11,030
the captain crunch decoder ring

76
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,889
history so much the same yourself

77
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,099
and see if there is a site for a period
of three

78
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,360
how many different periods could use

79
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,789
and still get a good start for us

80
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:23,489
twenty-five rate would be a twenty six
as what happens

81
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:25,810
lands right out of itself

82
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,300
okay so what you look for that little
weaknesses in the crypto system again

83
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,770
you're gonna find out that you're going
to get

84
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,499
a different number of common letters so
attack it don

85
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:44,499
ending caesar cipher would be

86
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,669
good luck and good music

87
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:54,669
and that would be enough ticket is
premature

88
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:23,819
this

89
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,619
so but stuff

90
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:32,410
way you'll i

91
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,890
and are the most common ones that you
find out

92
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,080
that you shifted over by three places
that has a lot of haitians

93
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,490
as a lot of w's

94
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,349
there's a lot of jesus probly caesar's

95
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,759
there's more

96
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,530
the french not to be outdone in the
military set seeing a caesar when i had

97
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,650
divide them up into three pieces

98
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,330
decided to come up with the the
parasites

99
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,740
and with the site for was the same page
let's go ahead and have multiple caesar

100
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,779
ciphers

101
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,149
wants is a sme

102
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,749
that means

103
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:08,559
you would pick a period letters to three
five pick the word pic of key

104
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:12,519
and any repeated over and over again to
get a five-letter ki

105
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,730
letter one

106
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,590
letters six eleven sixteen would all use
the first letter the key

107
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,869
adler to and seven and so on

108
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:25,479
so what you find out is that with five
simultaneous cypress go on

109
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,029
every fifth letter in this case

110
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,879
uses the same site for

111
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,150
but if you don't know and that

112
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,199
that distribution of a lot of common
letters starts to get

113
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,599
which together

114
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:43,069
and a good crypto system is designed to
make your output look like noise

115
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,469
and you can't see what's going on you
can tell what's going on

116
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:48,779
so in addition there site for

117
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,039
let's say we picked the key party
location that piano and our anti and why

118
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,080
did highlighted those columns here

119
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,939
and now what we have a message that we
want to go ahead

120
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,499
and let's say for example you've got
their good old attack it don tomorrow

121
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:04,539
will add a little bit of their

122
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,219
a lot of time to break it up into the
number of grilled letter groupings of

123
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,870
sticky 'cause it's easy 'cause we're
going to the first

124
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,400
of each of the groups with

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,530
the first letter of p part

126
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,569
and the first the next group of people
party and so on

127
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,099
think about letters like you do numbers
you can have them together

128
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,849
so what's people essay

129
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:28,669
a day

130
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,689
where we should all be right

131
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,620
okay so be it could be used to be polis
bsd

132
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,020
depots didi

133
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,650
h and so on and so

134
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,520
when you're bored when you get to the
wrap around again

135
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,009
okay so you're into a good group

136
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,919
mathematics groups have certain
properties that are very very nice in

137
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,349
that

138
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,409
things don't repeat make it look around

139
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,990
so here but the way i do this key what
do we get

140
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,789
something that's even more scramble

141
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,610
i did try to drink there were a shot

142
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,030
arab league's mls of whatever

143
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,420
what you're seeing now if you're not
seeing the same letter over and over and

144
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,300
over again

145
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,659
you see you you will letters appear

146
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:12,019
in the more unusual that outcome

147
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:14,649
of the crypto system

148
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:18,659
the less likely you are to look at it
built haha that's what it is

149
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,710
so the whole idea behind crypto

150
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,439
is to go ahead and make it

151
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,589
difficult

152
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,329
for somebody without the key to figure
it out

153
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,180
uh... you want

154
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,229
tool toolbox under kinda fast but always
like to be available

155
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,200
see how this all comes together

156
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,310
scott the play fair site

157
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,380
or i call it don t but i'm talking about
it yet don't treat the sick let's play

158
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,370
fair

159
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,680
and what that is a let's say for example
we don't have her jeffrey right so

160
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,980
hacker jeopardy needs more crept up

161
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,910
what you do in play fair is the idea was
to set up a fight by five

162
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,570
and with some basic rules as somebody
else issues if i buy five grid back in

163
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,840
the nineteen sixties and seventies

164
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,500
with them

165
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,390
bingo

166
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,010
you're great

167
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,530
there is a prisoners of war in the hanoi
hilton

168
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,730
they found out that if you had your
little thing here the creativity called

169
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,780
the tap co

170
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,080
role in column so if you want to set up
a it was a doc

171
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,149
dot cap

172
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,339
because these guys are tied up in
solitary confinement in fine for months

173
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,579
at a time but you could

174
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:28,890
go ahead and cap on the parts

175
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,250
and send little messages back and forth
a north vietnamese cappers never quite

176
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,330
figured out what the code words in
europe suburb but had no interrupted

177
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,700
and so

178
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,730
pretty quickly figure out where to go
ahead and change it did pull one letter

179
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,339
out

180
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,290
sort of a kind of slight around a little
bits we have to think about it

181
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,560
and heather are little cap coaches where
they communicated prisons

182
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,610
we'll hear what she'll do is we're going
to go ahead and we're going to

183
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,050
repopulate the letters and

184
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,630
the box

185
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,609
why would we do something like this

186
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,589
because now we're going to introduce

187
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:00,810
a new way of encrypting stuff

188
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,260
that unless you're thinking this way
it's just not going to make sense when

189
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
you look at the output

190
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,030
it you can't repeat ladders right so
each a_d_c_ kpr but then when you come

191
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,890
in jeopardy g_a_t_t_ areas they

192
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,100
cities that

193
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,510
and that's where you see

194
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,880
for example here go ahead we throw those
letters in there

195
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,580
it we come up with his little block

196
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,550
and all these guys drop in here

197
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,970
we get the last letter

198
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,230
we take whatever letters have not yet
been used we drop of that

199
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,150
and it probably got twenty six letters
in a little bit

200
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,170
but twenty six doesn't divide evenly as
a square rude and i settle box

201
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,110
so you gotta dropped a letter which
letter it we track here

202
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,840
what lotteries also sometimes dropped

203
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,530
she ate

204
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,160
asme wow

205
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,450
think about it if you drop the z

206
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,090
it's at the end anyway right it's not go
on anywhere is usually there

207
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,460
rapids need as a helpful

208
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,030
some real basic rules here when it comes
to play fair

209
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,080
i'm going to go ahead and and crypt

210
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,790
two letters at a time

211
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,320
for the diagram

212
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,640
this is important is the first cipher
that i now doing more than one hundred a

213
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,340
time

214
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,070
and if the two letters are in the same
role

215
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,750
okay i'd go ahead and it'll click

216
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,630
one oh

217
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,330
if in the same kalo

218
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,180
we go down

219
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,740
and if they're in opposite corners of a
box

220
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,790
and grab the other opposite corners of
the box

221
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:37,040
but wait u_s_ one of the gramm
surrounded the underdog off the bottle

222
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,279
because wraps around number two group

223
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,540
things round around you don't have
something passed me it was back in a

224
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,280
again

225
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,690
so let's take a look at this

226
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,350
how is it time for all whatever

227
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,540
organ encrypt out so first we break it
into this

228
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,799
there's no w i s dat

229
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,420
and now let's go ahead we're going to
take a look at our little box

230
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,010
answer hacker jeopardy needs more crypto

231
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,460
so if we take and all

232
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,460
let's look over here

233
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,550
and all

234
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,100
and we'll see

235
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,079
what's the opposite corners of the sanal
box

236
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,720
s here

237
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,000
populated w_r_

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,259
opposite corners are going to be one

239
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,990
extreme

240
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,080
and so

241
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,250
esti

242
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,960
who is also an opposite you both for the
same role so it's gonna wrap-around

243
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,580
appt roll up piano

244
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,380
always that walked

245
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,040
and it's pretty easy remedies site for
systems are designed to be done by yet

246
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,440
anybody's are

247
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,740
before as world war two allies cipher
systems that were being done

248
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,240
all computer by hand

249
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,130
why you didn't have your iphone out
there to go ahead and download a cute

250
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,040
little apt for ninety nine cents and
make it work

251
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,050
so these had anything to be able to do
with their heads with the rules that

252
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,359
could be repeated

253
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,730
allowed us flagship hired

254
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,580
we're probably expendable so they
weren't p_h_d_'s in math so he had to

255
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,180
have

256
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,380
something that was pretty
straightforward for them to do

257
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,460
fell that's a play fair site

258
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,480
well that's all great good but now what
do we do in the age of

259
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,940
digital lecture on actual day weekend
zeros and ones that so we've got

260
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,800
so this is

261
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,940
one thing we could look at is a one-time
yet this is pretty cool this really

262
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,270
kinda got going around world war one

263
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,899
the idea was if i have a key

264
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,360
is exactly the same line

265
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,940
as my plaintext

266
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,450
how likely is someone to break that

267
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,040
i don't repeat the key

268
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,920
you can't break it it's a but they call
the perfect site

269
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,490
because or the probably going to kia
there right

270
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,330
and so when i was in the navy what we
used to do is we would have the key

271
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,630
cards

272
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,730
and they would be couriered out

273
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,060
but the guy literally with the thing
handcuffed to address this up you see in

274
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,889
movies yet no kidding we do that

275
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,259
and he gets a little computer
charismatic call-up adam upbeat sign for

276
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,299
everything else you got a rocky went
eleven or theme a big rocks in little

277
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,059
rock said nobody want to do that

278
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,730
it was good for your career

279
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,260
we get these things we put on a ship it
ought to go he's they're transmitting

280
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,970
back-and-forth about to go

281
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,990
well already hurt like the walker
brothers

282
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,530
yeah vote turned out the first shift
that i had assigned to was the scene

283
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,000
ship that he was a

284
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,930
but about three they worked for years to
three years later february compton dot

285
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,370
he was a communications officer team
work his way out the and sold the soul

286
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,960
of the soviet union

287
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,370
and that was acting as an insider's five
story and miss secret code excess

288
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,440
dollars stuff

289
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,140
if you don't know what the crypto
machine looks like you're not sure the

290
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,580
owner of the laws

291
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,930
by using a secure little hand-in-hand
expired camera

292
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,990
you would go through and nobody was
around without a lot to do

293
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,410
take little pictures

294
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,940
of all the schematic ps

295
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,229
and a little dead drop it make a point
doesn't

296
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,040
soviet to pick them up

297
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,280
but what about the keys you might ask
they change them every day sometimes

298
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,540
every six hours because his

299
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,330
all this highly classified traffic

300
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,069
so they take these carried he didn't
strike right away

301
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:11,929
because you had to go ahead and get to
people assigned for me it brought me to

302
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:16,279
crush the accessing like that so annoyed
with a way to get in a poor antibodies a

303
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,190
spoiler

304
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,580
i'll take care of this for you just go
ahead at the beach have some fun now of

305
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,439
of sign

306
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,110
all release all of the right legis dot
watch

307
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,840
made everybody loved them because they
take care of that our stuff and so when

308
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,090
he would do

309
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,440
take pictures of all the cards

310
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,650
and then destroy them

311
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,370
amber mum and said the ashes flying
everywhere

312
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,530
but the microphone to work our way back
to the city

313
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,080
what they were able to do that is
rebuild the same equipment that we had

314
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,200
and then take the keystone replay the
recorded message traffic you know what

315
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,770
we're up to

316
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,600
he

317
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,600
if

318
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:30,020
stuff

alter speeds processes

324
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,060
if i could just be the key did the data
fast enough

325
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,829
it all seems well assets out there

326
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:48,720
i can encrypt it because it's just using
a simple excel

332
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,180
if you look at the bench closely

333
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,830
right there up into the uh...

334
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,070
that itself

335
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,760
it's got a little site for our

336
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,120
has got to letter grouping something
like that so what type of site for do

337
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,890
you think that might be

338
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,159
play fair it was a play for cyber

339
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:33,070
but no matter what the uh... ke was for
that

340
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,950
uh... anyway

341
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,370
there is a parameter so you can create
your own credible because those are

342
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,020

360
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,900
well being out there yet not really
understanding all about this in a

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,380
statement first-class for it

362
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,669
i'm glad i broke the second key

363
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:32,870
and just to rub it in

364
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,800
i wrote the software to break the key

365
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,720
basic

366
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,700
i saw that

367
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,630
and or work product line

368
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,580
you learn very quickly this abounds with

so let's roll back up here if you look
at people into a cop it bc creek camp

372
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,910
i guess was right after mardi gras took
my wife donna mardi gras for for very

373
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,759
first time

attracted lots of each other stuffed

375

contest right

383
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,690
i came up with some different plane tax
i said i got to go ahead no hi this is a

384
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,780
little clues and about people that we
research mukhabe came on your back but

385
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,390
what's unusual about this tax

386
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,400
take a look at it from all

387
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,240
no punctuation that's okay because his
only letters usually kripa system so

388
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,930
good observation but

389
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,510
several people

390
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,120
what he said

391
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,029
nao he his

392
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,960
well

393
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,350
that's called the program as a whole
book called and speak

394
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,250
began wrote

395
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,860
i kinda larry and his typewriter back
when people are papers

396
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,470
and so there are no easier the kite from
google when he after two days be tested

397
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,780
your evil finally figured out

398
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,140
finches cardinals excuse

399
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:19,140
side effects

400
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,490
this

401
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,110
here

402
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,730
you b c d e f g

403
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,230
and seven thirty one eighteen months of
home buyers number you can see all the

404
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,540
weight of the presentation

405
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,220
if you figured out the first round

406
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,130
you got it acadia clooney crack at it i
don't really want to buy talk on the

407
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,430
hacker looks past fifty kazi earlier
talked about a hacker looks at fiftieth

408
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,370
up on youtube if you want

409
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,640
and i have is really cool punch card has
been sitting in mom's attic for thirty

410
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,970
five years

411
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,590
and i have a little crypto clue on the
bottom now

412
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,860
let's look at the school

413
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,379
are used to play fair site for

414
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:21,010
vicki was a hacker looks past fifty hey
that was a talk right

415
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:27,950
so here we go again remember a h eighty
what we are used a c k

416
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,640
what's now we have a dot net all but we
are used also excellent scale rededicate

417
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,669
so what's next

418
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,200
and what comes next

419
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,840
p and then what

420
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,940
and then uh... high f_t_

421
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,100
why event

422
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,470
there goes a rest

423
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,920
so you see other populate certifying
right along pretty easy when you take

424
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,470
eighty above but fill a possible by by
five grad

425
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,850
or not you think you

426
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,960
we're not using

427
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,270
right now using the in this case okay

428
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,910
probably should have been differently

429
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,070
worry about it still works

430
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,280
so i sent a message is go ahead and
email me

431
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,840
go to a website

432
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,670
dial a phone number at the time many
d_n_a_ working on a white assignment

433
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,260
maybe eighteen trips to hawaii and two
years from east coast

434
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,370
the general said

435
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,590
you're going to be on you'd be the
director of the operations mixture

436
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,050
reservas www these coastal though you do
it

437
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,360
uh... so

438
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,210
racked up by a couple hundred thousand
frequent flyer miles and i had applied

439
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,230
for a number for a while

440
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,450
and send sometimes is which is as people
lightly thanks

441
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,559
we encrypt and the stuff for the plate
for but no ally wrote these messages

442
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,019
what's one of the things that comes out
of a play for the chicken end up with is

443
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:39,580
a letter pair

444
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,870
matter what two letters etc etc

445
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:48,279
it turns out that if i had two letters
in a row that is saying

446
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,810
or overall

447
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,530
i can't have or we have to all because
then it sort of a weakness in the five

448
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,220
right

449
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,500
so they say it cabin cdl every few
seconds accidents or or become or

450
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,550
accident or the next

451
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,870
which is a little bit more complicated

452
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:11,870
election mess it up or your directly

453
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,170
i couldn't do that

454
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,919
back with an active duty is guys

455
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,430
in other

456
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,500
what we find that means that if you see
double letters

457
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,780
encrypt the stuff

458
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,880
two letters together or what

459
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,000
cab double headers and a play fair so
that didn't always work in outlook and i

460
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,960
said okay you got a narain and i am i i
take a day forget it it's not a player

461
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,380
you can't have them ants hoti there

462
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,919
but it's the last one of one group in
the first of another group

463
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,220
at for

464
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,350
what they did but it did

465
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,860
is look at it to see whether it's not
even or even i did for hours and hours i

466
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,299
kept trying different solutions

467
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,500
setup later because they got

468
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,450
thrown off track

469
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,800
only because they didn't bother to count

470
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,220
position

471
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,460
surreal simple stuff like that

472
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,450
will call you know overlooked the right
answer

473
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,280
attorney bolick lewis

474
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,539
in napa like this number how we're going

475
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,870
top-to-bottom

476
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,110
the first clue is due to be with the
letter that we put all forty gether you

477
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,900
get the magic words to say that you are
going to be white beaches realist things

478
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,830
as a sense of number at the end

479
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,600
and uh...

480
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,870
tina did that

481
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,750
was for grad students are deploying a
recycling of like one ticket

482
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,710
they should give up three plane tickets
the southwest can anymore than renewal

483
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,580
system doesn't work that way

484
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,660
and it's only three plane tickets not
just do a round-trip ticket deported

485
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,250
back

486
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,610
i have to do

487
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,490
ten thousand dollars worth of retail fly
you get one tryptic

488
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,600
which is not

489
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,730
so that's another story

490
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,169
so they try to stop somebody else's
pause in the next year and exit sec

491
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:57,989
texted me said uh... i said yes they
have money for next year point

492
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:00,879
so abide for ticket step and two
thousand a puzzle

493
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,730
never wants all the deaf

494
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,130
tool some guy i know

495
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,669
by the year half later so that you are
sent to the puzzle he figured out

496
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,990
because what you've got things like ford
he's in a row nije nije he had so guess

497
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,730
what

498
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,679
isn't

499
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,700
out of liquor something else

500
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,140
with reckless cut what it was

501
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,760
but i think they said my notes

502
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,810
nonetheless skype figured out

503
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,299
so i bought a plane ticket

504
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,680
cicada

505
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,480
it's pretty cool

506
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,880
so lack next year

507
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,120
appears notional con and whether she
will come on i know is better than

508
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,510
lucinda had this morse code oracle to
moscow

509
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:42,470
and uh... trying out a string of one of
the buttons you're one of the dots

510
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,369
a decade

511
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,730
headed da da dat it was that about it

512
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,440
but that was close enough to would
probably figured out any way to get

513
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,890
although barcode barcodes barcode
everybody barcodes turns out that when

514
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,760
you put a bar called angle

515
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,290
you know pretty high resolution

516
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,530
it does like that he would scan

517
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,350
everest would gladly pay ninety nine
cents leader a c_n_n_ network

518
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,640
foreign that

519
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,950
one really indian guy looked at him and
he decides that the barcode by hand

520
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,650
as you can do about the fact that i
could figure that out so it turns out

521
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,870
the left or right order the markle being
used

522
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,659
whistle told wiki sugar brigid

523
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:24,260
was sold the fence and chocolate mousse
it was good to hear that all the other

524
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,510
moose oriented things and a bar code on
the and what what do you recognize in

525
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,390
the barcodes

526
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,289
all right one two three four five six
seven eight percent april twentieth

527
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,770
what's in the middle

528
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,890
one one two three five eight one three
two one

529
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,580
wells

530
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,770
that are not chasing clients

531
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,980
that's worth something

532
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,790
there

533
00:26:53,790 --> 00:27:00,790
for tennis a shot glass go fill that up

534
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:08,210
we got for the nazi sequence what's that
may not use a glance

535
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,230
as a layer at a small dog last

536
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,110
already

537
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,220
well scott but i wanted to go out to be

538
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,350
everything one

539
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,679
then one

540
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,010
wants to

541
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,809
and then

542
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,309
at you add up the numbers

543
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,819
one in one or two so one two one one
three three one things like that

544
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,480
so it's number here

545
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,960
adds up to the sequence the before so
one plus one s two one post it was three

546
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,269
to bus three is

547
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:36,350
replied ur eight

548
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,260
i dare thirteen twenty one sector so too

549
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,649
boulevard fibonacci you know about this

550
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,059
so we think those numbers

551
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,450
and then the guy said okay finally got a
list of rewards whistle teller muscle

552
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,010
defense of chocolate mousse it was good
tears of things like that

553
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,770
if you're a little nonsense phrases that
he came up with and there's a bunch of

554
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,880
garbage at the end someone

555
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,410
said maybe zero telomeres like vienna va

556
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,580
d_n_a_

557
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,970
doesn't matter

558
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,610
and problem is with the d_n_a_ when the
replication errors occur at telenor you

559
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,369
don't care

560
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:10,519
but eventually the replication errors
work their way back like it fused to the

561
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,769
real stuff that's what you can answer to
that

562
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:15,950
uh... theory

563
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,810
think we can

564
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,880
so if you notice here is also
autographed on the right what are

565
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,200
correct

566
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,020
cast well still not hearts

567
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:34,020
i pay blessed planets

568
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,760
the lord works in mysterious ways

569
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,300
we took those values

570
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,279
ticket that would actually sequence

571
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,710
and we said we want shipped them around

572
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,660
what did you shoot the first one starts
a column one column wanted to three vin

573
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,799
five nine eight

574
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,059
sinatra going to do is going to take
these things are emissions than that

575
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,370
many characters

576
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,809
if we go ahead and take this stuff

577
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:59,590
and we shift everything over a little
bit

578
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,810
advancing ariel retire at these things
around we get a hold lucy clients were

579
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,330
now these gonna wind up differently

580
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,100
and the stuff that you see diya orange
is that

581
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,590
stuff that makes sense

582
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,470
the stuff that

583
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,440
whose in the green actually if you go
back a little bit

584
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,700
it turned out to be bruce and heidi axo
g america's presided chilka

585
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,760
there's only one left over thing in each
column

586
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,490
why would they be only one left over
thing in each column

587
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,360
maybe that's a check some that makes a
column head up to something useful

588
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,679
at the in factories the numbers

589
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:39,630
that add up the columns

590
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,800
and then

591
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,730
module based twenty-six right the wrap
around twenty six twenty seven goes back

592
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,669
to want to get

593
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:49,990
knowing about twenty six of these i'll
get back to your real

594
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,920
nine twenty four forty one twenty five
zero

595
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,720
fifteen fourteen zero fifty state what
those things up and say what do we get

596
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,690
if one is a who is the previously and so
as we might expect

597
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,549
so we get with this whole sequence of
numbers

598
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:07,080
it turns out that you get

599
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,880
xn eight godbless and the guys who
figured out that burst

600
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,019
they want the press

601
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,210
and what kind of sick mine comes up with
this

602
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,890
pisses me sitting at bruce's heidi's
dining room table

603
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,690
try to come up with something for the
count their badges 'cause they had to

604
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,779
get him out to the printer the next day

605
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,389
i guess bruce and get a piece a graph
paper

606
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:30,220
he downloaded off the internet the
credit

607
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,289
us it's like i'm old

608
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,160
at forever and stuff

609
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,649
penned up an eighteen

610
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:39,890
june eighteen stages stuff

611
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:44,049
so befor school was look for gold on the
back on cd because everybody it's a

612
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,409
great see you know what i said i was out
there

613
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,090
something that looked like there

614
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,410
acceptable familiar at all

615
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:58,410
any students of literature perhaps

616
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,870
periodic table

617
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,950
anyone

618
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,549
anyone buehler

619
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:05,720
euler

620
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,010
uh... well

621
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:14,010
what's a file that

622
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,360
side

623
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:25,360
first

624
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,910
he

625
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,780
he's

626
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,580
the stubborn so they'd at least so on

627
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,160
so it's fresh appearances ysleta toward
a force of different culture right

628
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,890
cultural icons aggro unc olympic floyd

629
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,590
james dean and ran it may be other
people read

630
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,990
we've had a lot of fun

631
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,610
and it was a number stays you had to go
through with a final guyana calling on

632
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,360
the phone

633
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,540
i my cellphone at special

634
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,520
lords number

635
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,389
that was only used in this contest

636
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:22,240
it turned out that i was the same guy
cracked the other contest to correct the

637
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,139
other contests and i said you know if
you're feeling on beautiful is sort of

638
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:26,269
great picture

639
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:30,750
acknowledged that it just kept on it

640
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:36,320
so last year i was asked to do clark on
twenty two am which is also today

641
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,899
app in rhode island but you can see
where i am right now

642
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:41,390
they can't be canceled it

643
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,509
because they could make it

644
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:47,840
and i can't be around sis

645
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,799
probably house

646
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,330
got to be severe

647
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,669
by the speaker a beer

648
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:54,909
deadheads

649
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:57,380
their ego

650
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,660
no i don't want the when you're drinking

651
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,490
yahoo wanted to light beer anyway got
real beer

652
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,830
the baby beer

653
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,120
all right sam adams you can opener for
and i've already broke this has happened

654
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,040
uh... admitted that she thought but
dozens of our right

655
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,169
expatriate

656
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:24,370
terrestrial

657
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,389
already sell

658
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:29,460
let's take a look at our top what is the
stuff like a light

659
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,170
about what i quit self for the bottle
flags writes a love for sell for us what

660
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,139
you do that and positions of the single
flight

661
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,000
but maybe it is a bigger royal

662
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,179
apart their pride in status so that
night and read

663
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,020
and if you read these flags which i can
because i wanted them in the navy many

664
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,010
many years ago

665
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,389
broadly that all kill your age i would
you say you know and

666
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:55,070
and then go out around the corner is

667
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,629
puede two d_d_i_ have easily take

668
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:58,490
quanta

669
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,600
three times

670
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,580
and on the right hand side up all these
different letters

671
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:09,009
c_a_c_ w t f c ok p

672
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:10,639
what is this

673
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,249
when is it

674
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:16,269
do you like alright propos causal i
start solvents

675
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:19,419
primed for so you do is what

676
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:22,159
by about a alright

677
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,169
it couldn't hurt

678
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:30,169
the flags the letters

679
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:37,769
backside okay

680
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,889
lazy actor

681
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:40,720
packets up

682
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,520
so it doesn't

683
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,509
hotmal but he said are you glad closing
the gap

684
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:46,989
what's the size of the grid

685
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:52,649
nine nine nine what else you see it it's
nine nine nine

686
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,049
hollis at that

687
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:59,529
all right

688
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:01,109
to audit you want to drink

689
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,929
like it's nineteen eighty four

690
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:07,389
if you're forty national security
feature act last

691
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:11,689
where they go

692
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:13,290
at the same dot was all

693
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,300
and it turns out i could translate the
letters of the numbers as a matter what

694
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,110
number

695
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,090
there's only eight letters etc aloha
kind you know how tough it was a come up

696
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,030
with us and although that only had eight
of the nine numbers and what it was

697
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,559
completely missing edwin for it

698
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,480
so you figure it out here so i'll listen
to local puzzle

699
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,480
then what do you think you do this

700
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:50,099
surface

701
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:11,749
it

702
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:16,899
started

703
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:20,999
deadlock started fifty five a wet my
pants right

704
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:23,669
about what it does it all

705
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:25,649
what else could they be

706
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:30,269
you can g_p_s_ dell latitude longitude
okay so it turns out that we had six

707
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:31,409
said his

708
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:34,099
one for the program

709
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:36,329
one from the schedule

710
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:40,369
okay those never showed up at all by the
way gable bessie's initiator hide in

711
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:45,719
plain sight i'll abide in pigs in plain
sight

712
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,589
you you're right on the schedule for all
the conferences that had lat long and

713
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:50,870
direction stuff like that

714
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,190
plus some poetry that i put in the
different program things like that they

715
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,859
would say okay

716
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:00,359
you know what a fly like the distance so
total things if you solve the puzzle so

717
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,659
here's what happened so as a role

718
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:04,229
three six nine

719
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:06,249
eleven of the updates still say

720
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:08,729
because of the four

721
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,309
couples that they used to have

722
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:12,829
if you look at him and you line them up

723
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:15,999
it turns out that if you look at what
i'd like to go to google maps every

724
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:20,219
single one of those suckers lands on top
of some weird airport

725
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:21,479
but it's an airport

726
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:24,369
because that was a team and i were the
program guy look like a southwest

727
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:26,050
airlines handout but instead of

728
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,639
the seven thirty seven oh two one three
three seven pretty good job

729
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,099
so it's a knots

730
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,549
we look at the airport codes that we get
those letters to the airport coz

731
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:38,599
one of the things that you find it

732
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,399
or you need a pebble letters and most of
the classical side refused to give the

733
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,049
between words

734
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:47,099
because you need to break a detected
crypt space

735
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,249
and so

736
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:51,059
a lot of time just seems the just throw
those out

737
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,879
and so if you take a look at these codes
at the connected on the right order

738
00:37:54,879 --> 00:38:00,140
and what do you think that says eso y
all you m usd

739
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,299
and the

740
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:04,549
year say so you must never say mickey
moves

741
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:08,319
i couldn't quite get it perfect because
it just worked some airports out there

742
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,899
with the names that we need it

743
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:13,609
or use realtor words

744
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:16,979
the guys on this process and uh...
thoughts of the other puzzles

745
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:21,569
work

746
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,389
let me go to work out

747
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:24,490
this really cool

748
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,989
is outstanding political and for calm

749
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,830
it's not that the other two great job

750
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,599
it's a store had twelve

751
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,589
and doctor perry said that you are
elected to the keynote

752
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:39,319
and design the badge and designed to
curb the puzzle and it's pretty much it

753
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,080
was like

754
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,289
a playground to do anything i wanted out
there

755
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,669
salter

756
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:46,719
uh... and so

757
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:49,609
what i did as he came up with some
really cool stuff that was a program

758
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:51,999
it's things like that this is the
schedule it took a picture of this

759
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:52,909
account

760
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:54,449
all the dopant took a look

761
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:57,639
the badges were actually supposed to
have

762
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,049
all kinds of electronic sound like i was
going to do that workout

763
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:05,289
you can stop the top of the back of the
room but if you alta

764
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:08,699
programmable right along the spine what
can you see here

765
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:11,359
omarska odm sensation things here

766
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,510
that all around the outside of the
business of critical in the middle

767
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,200
it turned out the stuff from the outside
of it

768
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,879
was the uh... base or my dual twelve

769
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:24,380
representation of ascii characters

770
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,049
and i just can't look at that i said
well that's what it's not my puzzle

771
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:28,940
and at that

772
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,710
closing ceremonies they just mention
that my sentiments about space for them

773
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,699
actually on it

774
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:37,450
but it doesn't look the ends responses
have been the money

775
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:42,149
so it was a whole bunch of stuff in
there this is the back of the t-shirt

776
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:49,149
you might know yet the and the at sliver
just said well what you are at

777
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:51,479
well secret

778
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,819
so what could it be agreed to do it

779
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:56,109
we could do caesar sight words

780
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:57,159
if you do

781
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:00,219
genera ciphers needed to play for
ciphers

782
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:04,659
and things like that they have to do
this fight one apparently position at

783
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:08,200
this cooperative later the stats faces
at so

784
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,770
member here there are ways

785
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,160
multiple ciphers running simultaneously

786
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,629
what's obviously in a lot of my sight
for contests

787
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:18,649
g_m_ hair came to turns out that if you

788
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,679
concretely woodville luther's do you
work

789
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,099
you get this old-time standstill it
speed of light so use your skill to gain

790
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,169
insight a little palm on the back of all
these t-shirts

791
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:32,489
and then you look at the back to you it
would be code with the key insane i

792
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:34,420
remember at the closing ceremonies
places

793
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:40,149
what else i can see cases look at the
first two lines was a speed of light

794
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:42,639
say alike

795
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:48,189
so what's the speed of light

796
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:50,569
it's not equals m_c_ squared

797
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:55,999
what's the likeliest

798
00:40:55,999 --> 00:41:00,670
two nine nine seven two four by six used
for seconds or awesome but said emerging

799
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,960
back there

800
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,669
affair

801
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:11,179
come here

802
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:15,859
how does that a car and this is a
national security agency card

803
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:19,139
this is a really cool collide in
ordinary citizen of this really cool

804
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:20,050
quiet

805
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,089
trickling in

806
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:23,930
that's will help to study presented
quite

807
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,160
freeze throughout

808
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,079
and if you have really wasn't

809
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:34,079
i'll give you a phone number to call the
ltte play words

810
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:44,099
about back for a box

811
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,409
yeah

812
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,179
harry harry likes it

813
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:51,169
and like it

814
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:54,649
so g_s_a_ returns on the back of the
program

815
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,729
was this big black of tax

816
00:41:56,729 --> 00:42:00,209
which happen to be the exact number of
character length

817
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:01,920
of the crypto sculpture

818
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,099
at c_i_a_ and it turned out that if you
took

819
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:08,709
key number and a lot of work to in
staten island and i and and seven and i

820
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:09,880
intend to five

821
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,769
or primary

822
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,619
he repeated sequence

823
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:16,359
you got a little message congratulations
father hidden message chapter that

824
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:19,490
little phrase and then one last held for
you look

825
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,319
now

826
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,409
what you expect to see when you look
down

827
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,550
no you cure biotic better you see

828
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,480
your badge and then there was a little
next diesel initially stage is going to

829
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,319
build up to the next

830
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:34,519
so our official kindly share it

831
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:38,489
and so inside the program page celebs
little crypto contest what else to see

832
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:44,169
energy recognize out of the word
cryptogram just across the top

833
00:42:44,169 --> 00:42:47,409
well we're not going to show

834
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:50,739
however moz

835
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,269
first column

836
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,040
and so

837
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,889
it will save your key what type of
cipher could you probably do

838
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:02,369
the caesar cipher right the first

839
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:06,069
role as a group that would ban which is
you shipped at thirteen

840
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:08,669
always going to shift at fifteen

841
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,449
ass and so on and he

842
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:14,159
turns out that it's a simple since i've
heard it just started

843
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,419
so guess what you take most

844
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:21,920
because begins to track these things out
here because he memory and the key

845
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,499
to get the seifert usaid rakhi ki to get
the point exe

846
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:28,859
w minus them

847
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:29,940
it's g eighty

848
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,380
and each one assembly member yet it
sometimes we had twenty six oh doesn't

849
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,080
wrap-around become negative

850
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,979
two u_s_ the

851
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:38,120
also defined up

852
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,589
just look down

853
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:41,020
it's lodi

854
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,709
first and last go down than up

855
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:45,959
to find the key

856
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,299
and now you look at the badges

857
00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:51,489
we had five different beds types

858
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:54,900
it turned out that if you look at them
fairly carefully people palestine really

859
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,329
quick elected before even showed up
there there are you figure it out

860
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:00,339
that under the reason line

861
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,939
up that was morse code

862
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:04,379
dabba gotten a little

863
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:08,839
random that turismo what's called
masters there

864
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:09,719
and if you

865
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:12,849
look at the mo course code messages you
get really really weird

866
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:16,800
things like zero boat would be issue one
armadillo to yesterday three telegraphed

867
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,349
what the hell was i cranky when i made
that

868
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:23,749
probably

869
00:44:23,749 --> 00:44:27,549
but if you look carefully what do you
see

870
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:31,149
but at the first go down than up

871
00:44:31,149 --> 00:44:36,249
put in our may in the speed with you

872
00:44:36,249 --> 00:44:37,539
thursday

873
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:40,449
and so then you look at the schedule and
you see this

874
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:42,200
but nobody really say

875
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,559
but of course 'cause we're all friends
and we didn't do the c_i_a_ and this is

876
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,239
they crypto sculpture

877
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:51,269
which looks like this in real life

878
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:53,909
but looks like this abstract

879
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:57,069
but note also that it doesn't really say
the crypto stuff

880
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:02,159
which is a gripping with cryptosporidium
kripa what what

881
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:08,439
shrill contra contra casual casual just
sites across was a dictionary table

882
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,410
but with the word she will come in there

883
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,139
what's the problem with she will kind of
a vision there

884
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:17,279
i got two oh four am alexander right

885
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:20,129
and say you can't do that but i did it
anyway

886
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:24,219
i want a smart guy who homologue or are
they so he can do that so we got our

887
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:28,289
subtract them artist like display at the
linens

888
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:29,230
so this is

889
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,679
crypto scottr

890
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:33,799
brisbane

891
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:37,309
cha could be a bush one purpose i
created what

892
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:38,929
here is a repeat

893
00:45:38,929 --> 00:45:42,949
the crypto skiing or sadness is on the
c_i_a_ sculpture care waikiki o_s_

894
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,359
crypto script those

895
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:46,969
and it works its way around the diagonal

896
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:48,469
and this is posted

897
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:49,909
by the guy who ended up

898
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:55,209
doing wherever did the artwork that
purpose

899
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:57,679
sample contempt

900
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,719
he's of about a group of stuff so very
similar to encrypt does

901
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:06,469
and so i created a crippled attrib
article appeared sunday might be that

902
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:10,269
physician who gone through a country
probably needs the kind of a but

903
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:13,659
or by the way this is what the creek who
was that if we get if you look back it

904
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:16,289
was printed in the program

905
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:20,019
but look a lot of right-hand edge where
you see last character

906
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:22,099
healthy awstats

907
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:25,159
less whilst their pretty art

908
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:28,349
event next i would send them back side

909
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:30,489
two thousand okay thanks

910
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:32,200
with

911
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:39,200
thanks

912
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:49,259
this

913
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:10,439
this stuff

914
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:11,989
sit at the site

915
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:12,630
here

916
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,709
just look at the site for tax would look
like optical costs let's get to work

917
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,349
and we go ahead and we just

918
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:20,409
book yet

919
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:22,379
role with the eminent

920
00:47:22,379 --> 00:47:24,829
and we find out that

921
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,959
we take a r_j_ w_ i_ that

922
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:31,139
and it turns out that if you look

923
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:35,679
you'll find the letter that hidden
inside first it was so the first role

924
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,460
that are inside first to the letter are

925
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,679
and that's really gay inside this too

926
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:42,500
eat right

927
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,559
and what's next w goes through

928
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,099
aidan and i feel eighty didi

929
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,789
are u

930
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:53,029
at stats what could be our you you

931
00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:54,299
remember it

932
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:57,649
novel you could have been that uh...
anything

933
00:47:57,649 --> 00:48:01,999
but would be rpm press pm

934
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:06,189
okay that confuses you should not be
coming to these conferences

935
00:48:06,189 --> 00:48:08,199
so it's like the address

936
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,349
okay and so on and at the end

937
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:13,180
so i'm just saying as their ego there so
the answers

938

i p address shabu condi i i

939
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:20,229
now what

940
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:23,119
robert reich if you think a little bit
with these things

941
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,929
we've got the five stage eloquent we've
used every other entries of the puzzle

942
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:30,619
except this thing here and what is this
is a great call this a hidden word

943
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:31,989
puzzle

944
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:33,670
i loved it because it

945
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,779
was a good word puzzle that was a good
word puzzle

946
00:48:36,779 --> 00:48:40,949
and you've got say they've got i'm i'm
lyn of if you mark again

947
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:43,229
i was going to come up

948
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:46,679
sexy active sex and that

949
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:51,459
sex addiction of also cited the shop
because i've got and nineteen are

wells we got there

952
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:56,710
pcp

953
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,149
not eric dot here

954
00:48:59,149 --> 00:49:02,489
uh... tackles maybe

955
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:04,359
god minus one

956

secret there's all kinds of course
public and nothing whatsoever

957
00:49:09,669 --> 00:49:12,879
and some people spend hours screwing
around and saying

958
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:16,149
for no good reason bite you

959

968
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:53,859

971
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,280
so i'm looking for an idea of a reso

972
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,699
the first perot is in

973
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:10,929

a manned up saying okay creole three

four four eight one five five

975
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,249
three eight nine what the house that

976
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:21,069
out there that they are at the address
you do know of course

977
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:26,339
that idea addresses are broken up into
two hundred and fifty six

978
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:27,479
by chocs

979

980
00:50:29,049 --> 00:50:32,239
test for your personal convenience at
some real life number it something

00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,699
number these don't dot subterranean

982
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:40,859
and resulted that's unless you have a
macintosh product and that it does not

983
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:44,439
resolve

984
00:50:44,439 --> 00:50:47,279
actor and sell that you're using

985
00:50:47,279 --> 00:50:48,949
firefox

986
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:55,949
with the lease

00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:23,519

988
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:30,149

pay richter

991
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:39,039
because it was trying to read which you
type instead of actually resolve which

992
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:42,369
you do it they fix that subsequently

993
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:45,679
a lot of people that know that and the
team always want to say that finally

994
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,789
would be my buddy who is one like seven
alike contest

995
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:50,539
got hung up on this

996
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:53,539
because they did not understand that i
like the address of the best number

997
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:56,900
could be just never and said gold pass

998
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,429
ten other people

999
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:01,369
said go ahead

1000
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,879
carbon fiber

1001
00:52:02,879 --> 00:52:06,829
es estado de locate c_e_o_ pay us
question it's okay if you don't reject

1002
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:10,719
who here do this before right now that
the stats number works at the address

1003
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:14,140
at least twenty or thirty percent of
people do know that i said yes ten

1004
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,619
people statistically

1005
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:18,039
one of our and probably two or three rd
dot

1006
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:22,459
may never bothered to definitely lhasa
cabinets and how we do a gas is said to

1007
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:25,529
it fell if failed to close you
directions

1008
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:28,199
so good things come in for a she had
them together so you get the made that

1009
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:32,019
will stay with you unite the address
choke on the i_r_a_

1010
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:36,109
and you go ahead and you get this thing
that when you go that piping address it

1011
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:40,239
gives you this again he and the letters
together like numbers needed she market

1012
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:42,169
schmoke on dot u_s_

1013
00:52:42,169 --> 00:52:47,359
and i bought smoke on that u_s_ parade
think about a ninety nine it go daddy

1014
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,859
piece that once and i don't care about a
more socially watchful god

1015
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:52,049
dot u_s_

1016
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:54,439
goes ahead it's better

1017
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:57,359
two dollars that's what i pay for it you
know

1018
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,909
again to let it go

1019
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:05,909
so it's of these things up so that we
don't do are a lot of palms suburb

1020
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:08,539
and now

1021
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:10,160
this is not a racist

1022
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,019
no is is not

1023
00:53:12,019 --> 00:53:13,969
a confederate flag

1024
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:19,719
it might resemble the battle flag of the
army of northern virginia

1025
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:22,449
if you are a good historical reference

1026
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:27,059
but it also could look like a slightly
discolored nautical flag with letters

1027
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:28,170
inserted into it

1028
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,759
the point is this is this cons

1029
00:53:31,759 --> 00:53:33,129
jelic

1030
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:34,909
an insider badges

1031
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:36,929
at a new programs

1032
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:40,559
and i have a price for the person
themselves with

1033
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,890
so i've given you with some ideas and
some clues about tales from the crypto

1034
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,850
i hope you had a lot of fun with this
because what you're gonna find out is

1035
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,239
that no matter how sophisticated yet

1036
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:55,049
impropriety going forward isn't basic
fundamental principles that apply to

1037
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:56,639
everything that we do there

1038
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:59,249
if you understand the simple moves

1039
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:02,379
you can then look at stuff and discern

1040
00:54:02,379 --> 00:54:06,209
what the most likely outcome as you can
they can't use your brain he can be

1041
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:08,659
really really smart if you do that

1042
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:12,849
someday soon you two will be giving
talks on tales from the crypto thank you

1043
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:13,099
very much
