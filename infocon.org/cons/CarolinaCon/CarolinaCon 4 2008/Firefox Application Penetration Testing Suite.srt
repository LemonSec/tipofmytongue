00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,590
when we come back

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,530
and it looks at some point acts of
misconduct

32
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,139
stated here today to discuss

33
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,669
so we can go to extremists

34
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,369
he's gonna have used

00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:18,449
geographic dollar hospital

36
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:21,239
psyched up fast

37
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,749
but you can see the soap opera

38
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:28,179
this is all too easily soliciting
sessions

39
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:31,299
do useful things

40
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,369
we can all

41
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,319
exceeds demand

42
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,339
the repeal

43
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,750
soliciting any dues

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,699
went a step by prosecuting

45
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,139
build

46
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:45,299

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,379
loses registries tamper data

48
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,609
just subjectively fine homebuilding

49
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:54,309
and we're gonna do experts contaminated

50
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,670
but we're going to replace the t_v_

51
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,249
cast

52
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:01,999

53
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:02,770
axis

54
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,139
source to see if we put in extraditing

55
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:10,989
this is all i think after talks

56
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:17,139
since sweet clearances

57
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,550

58
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,209

59
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,290
somebody else's bugs

60
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,569
so this doesn't work

61
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,430
looking at the same time because
somewhere

62
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,369
obvious things like

63
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:34,459
it's what you find people doing these
days

64
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:41,459
with the best

65
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:46,359
so people appear to be oversight

66
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,149
pieces look interesting

67
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:49,919
when things start

68
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,059
so interesting that this is the
background

69
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:58,189
you don't see anything it looks just
like your site

70
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,949
you know what's going on and we don't

71
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:00,989
obsession

72
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,109
misusing ajax explicit process
particularly used ceaser

73
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,609
because it's going to be checks we can
see several times

74
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:17,609
contributing because we respect

75
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:22,690
and suddenly akiyama backpacker

76
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,639
he has not stopped

77
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,989
a most annoying thing

78
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,680
soap tables that you did

79
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,300
israel's did

80
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,160
prospect

81
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,949
it was that one process for people

82
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,340
over the past

83
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,389
access

84
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:48,039
which we didn't do anything

85
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,550
tvc is fantastic

86
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,070
so i was gonna tell u what's going on

87
00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:01,070
so here knows that is one

88
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:03,099
residue

89
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:05,580
uh... soap

90
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,520
process that is just one of the

91
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,349
transactions really did so

92
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:22,349
excesses dot com so if you don't know
what website as president

93
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:41,089
so some of the stats show a that about
eighty percent of relapse

94
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,059
such as his or her

95
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:50,059
websites that you know what you said

96
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:11,179
little recession

97
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:12,289
do something

98
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,659
basically advising the clinton

99
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,470

case that these are all

122
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:29,789
process at the moment actually sitting
there

123
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:33,159
so that i actually don't have that order

124
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,379
selected

125
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,370
connection other than

126
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:46,370
you can do this to exploit

127
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:54,069
what's on the top

128
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:05,009
aesthetic

129
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,060
and adopt ecstasy acts

130
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,999
so it's everywhere

131
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:17,939
well

132
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,149
exactly

133
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:24,249
yet so

134
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:28,860
it seems like a situation is getting
worse

135
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,390
process critics seeking direction web
application

136

of this error

137
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,910
is a common volatility in explosives
database

138
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,390
so it's the database of all the public

the first time actually outnumber the
number above

142
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,610
so i'll take out all the focus

143
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,800
gallup the focus is currently

144
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,230
so i'll see

145
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,470
process to do it

146
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,820

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,590
you could be part of a pop-up box

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,120
because as we begin to break a musical
instrument cookie

178
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,400
mclaughlin

179
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,410
they don't want to the website

180
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,810
because they have to put

181
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,660
prosecuting this becomes

182
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,480
it's perfect store

183
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,650
is reflected invite you to think that
your browser

184
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,870
and you would not say anything biting
example we right back

185
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,000
as easy reflected process work

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,420
was nothing storms

187
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,050
do what he is the safest

188
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,660
store processed so it's pretty database
potential for about a piece of

189
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,770
so i can still substance abuse in the
mail

190
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,970
so let's ask it

191
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,630
uh... to deal with the fact that

192
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,080
doesn't deal with store

193
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,880
one actual storms holds

194
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,850
technical problems that we have to do

195
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,350
no country

196
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,500
borrowing chalkboard

197
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,130
so that i

198
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:35,150
so that's it

199
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:42,150
cscl

200
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,900
so that should be good

201
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,390
unless they come

202
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:06,390
games like sisters

203
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,770
if there's still a cookie it doesn't
matter

204
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,170
at first but i don't remember

205
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,750
at all

206
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,460
obsessions

207
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,050
if you steal my session

208
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,260
what's the first thing

209
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,200
nature doesn't tight

210
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,340

212
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,730
maximal

213
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,980
dozens of other people say oh i don't

214
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,820
and uh... you know you see fifteen
amsubject

215
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,260
here at a_b_c_ apartheid

216
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,700
so it's uh... what that means

217
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,560
when somebody touches it

218
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,150
them up and i i don't

219
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,820
so what we recommend is that

220
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,280
i'm not saying what

221
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,930
it's a good time

222
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,500

the teenagers as they can send it

233
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,370

234
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,750
you can use the jackson

236
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,520
despite written above

ajax fitness

238
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,260
and runs the process for people who

239
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,550
and still going on

240
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,170
you know that this is what's what's
important

241
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,280
too much

242
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,050
teaching technologies are coming in
these days

243
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,530
chaturvedi beans

or agents

246
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,840
uh... so what you do these things
because of the child

247
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,700
sources you tools that sounds fantastic

248
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,110
for diminished

249
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,080
so sarah a rugby

250
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:21,080
uh... web upstate

251
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,150
so there's quite a few parking
open-source tool

252
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,240

websphere

254
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:39,370
tony's parents say it

255
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,730
it's quite a few happy

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,030
it's organism

259
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,250
and then delete

260
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,590
palace in oslo for our viewers

261
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:08,590
uh... placard

262
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,640
integrated

263
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,080
for every time you know things

264
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,660
the patented this kind of hard work
businesses and

265
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,090
you know someone above us

266
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:30,090
product cost about thirty five thousand

267
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,030
it's it becomes very expensive exactly

268
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,410
out sometimes they're and little

269
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,080
i guess

270
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,080
considerably don't celebrate life

271
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,220
a lot going on

272
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,990
writing a lot more for

273
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,140
disabled

274
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,640
something very specific

275
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,810
also pass the actually way that need to
test application

276
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,810
yes it would be the most technically
sound to you

277
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,930
edsall if they do you think

278
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,910
websphere

279
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,950
we have to know what the operation gpm

280
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,020
as also

281
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,910
what we're really looking for here is a
tool that

282
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,309
it's very lightweight

283
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,320
where does exactly what we wanted to do

284
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,240
point quite correct

285
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,860
what we're finding is that we do a lot
of training for developers and

286
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,959
objects are worth fighting seven dollars
or

287
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,450
using any of these old

288
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,380
they're not using them

289
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,270
webster they're not testing and
application

290
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,920
uh... first of all it's not

291
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,350
needed for that let's start up the
sentiments

292
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,560
policies has always impact on the
grounds of the moment

293
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,560
so exactly what we do want to use it and
i still single

294
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,350
this is a few places sincere hardening

295
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,990
that's somebody

296
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,580
and development should be able to
understand snorkel

297
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,860
itself before us

298
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,110
pushing out to test that should be easy
enough that they can verify begin

299
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,319
testing

300
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,290
and once it gets to the just think that
is jewish it was all citizens

301
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,600
post-production

302
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,540
wheatgrass consultants co in

303
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,850
expressed in post production we should
be able to uh... central so we wanted to

304
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,970
let

305
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,970
what off the keyboard there and
technical skills instead of the like

306
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,710
here of course i guess kaczynski's
presentation button

307
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,650
six considering that it's a classic

308
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:40,050
tired process cost as much law student

309
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,490
how do you see it

310
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,210
where you can see here and i don't know
if we're going to be developer is

311
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,550
actually one disease

312
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,279
and fine

313
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,300
want portability

314
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,149

the cost to fix something production

317
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,720
old so this case has been

318
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,490
japan is there any hope

319
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:15,490
this is what the process today

320
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,290
probably about

321
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,610

skirts against

349
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,520
into this

350
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,190
solicitors science

351
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,290
right now we present a piece

352
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,640
expects people

353
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,020
and mostly black

354
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,220
convicted that he was dressed in a
minute

355
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,870
that's what we've done speeds

356
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,840
well it isn't it

357
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,770
that's what he knows as well

358
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,910
there's three one two three six or
possibly

359
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,620
well depending on your browser

360
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,400
and user action

361
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,920
three hundred years here

362
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,510
indexer to keep its taxpayers

363
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,380
reasons behind bars

364
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,280
what subjects according to the serbs
were killed

365
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,750
income brackets processor

366
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,450
but let me see quickly instantly will be
prosecuted

367
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,910
whose gingrich

368
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,180
based on the web

369
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,980
his first target

370
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,150
changed like him

371
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,400
it's an act

372
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,490
dissenting

373
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,330
peter

374
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,080
our states

375
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,450
for cross occurred

376
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,860
because we grew up

377
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,289
extra processed

378
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:02,390
people everyday currently alexis de
tocqueville's era

379
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,100
except you can pull out her website you
get the chance

380
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,430
within your own website

381
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:14,430
but the records are

382
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,850
club javascript

383
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,570
space you do

384
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,360
we'll be looking for him

385
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,620
probably one of the quote unquote

386
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,590
your

387
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,490
springs rd

388
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,970
it's most prominent figure it out

389
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:39,890
so we'll see

390
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,440
actually using

391
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,130
three civilians dot struts

392
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:56,540
so if you want to use

393
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,240
produced talk accent

394
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,669
so do you know

395
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,780
is a hundred and streams

396
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,190
it takes a while

397
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,430
so you can save a few flypaper tax in a
car

398
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,530
most of the things i see you just said
that number is

399
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:17,540
so you can quickly is getting a existed

400
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,330
attacks on the tax

401
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,220
out there

402
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:28,140
perhaps to do

403
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,460
user-pic

404
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,929
white population

405
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,919
where you can somehow

406
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,560
identifies

407
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,370
you see what he was tested

408
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,240
and he's the special characters

409
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,309
so we're looking for mister

410
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:47,420
specifically

411
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:54,120
and he did more members

412
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:01,120
so this was the strings here

413
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,670
mathematics

414
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,210
so you didn't think so

415
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,670
rest tomorrow

416
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,130
signature is that if you want to submit
this to us

417
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,300
politically correct

418
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,350
you'd have to take action

419
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,510
you have to do that

420
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,070
you'll like this one

421
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,200
you can export the slowest

422
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,350
expo

423
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,070
doubling other xml file

424
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,940
see changes list as indeed

425
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:35,940
customize it to you

426
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,290
asus

427
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:05,290
used to seeing

428
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,480
evidence that capital

429
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,240
which is actually processor

430
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,240
misinform fields

431
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,030
minefield

432
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,090
so we can actually go

433
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,429
only check that one

434
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,730
we don't want to start

435
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,460
she's my best

436
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,940
atop tax-deferred one field

437
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,300
thereby everything

438
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:46,110
nicely over time

439
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:51,160
you know at least as well

440
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:58,160
three different strains

441
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,980
details

442
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,770
so that you don't

443
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,280
let's see how it happened

444
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,670
they don't fifty to two hundred dollars

445
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,590
put the alley

446
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,850
he said

447
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,070
interests

448
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:20,070
drug exactly how to fix it

449
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,169
you're stupid u_s_ citizens

450
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,590
you saw there was an option

451
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,040
that such a feature

452
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:48,040
we realized that interest rate cuts

453
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,590
under-taxed and say it

454
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,720
that's a thousand

455
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,110
so we thought you know every every time
you find a process

456
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,160
the b_b_c_'s just don't feel

457
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:07,160
it forms a whole

458
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,600
for every field

459
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,620
will be like

460
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:21,940
so we first got a second

461
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:28,940
we say that's a possibility

462
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,040
yes that's what you see uh...

463
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,670
we saying is that

464
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,130
but the breakout

465
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,090
every single one of those two directors

466
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,400
whereas

467
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,320
indictments

468
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,130
uh... because repeatedly sick

469
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:02,130
types comes back

470
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,990
stockpiles process could take

471
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:24,990
we knew that when you're testing at
random

472
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,890
rate and see if the scripts gets
executed

473
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,020
and it's very easy to see if this is the
exception

474
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,520
pop up boxes

475
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,510
change something up for me to visually
see here

476
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:43,060
well hijacked

477
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,110
biscuits executed well

478
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,620
believe it was this doctor

479
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,900
mental horrible

480
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,919
costs extra

481
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,510
web addresses the sensitive falls before

482
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,890
and testing

483
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,710
hitchcock's brussels

484
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:05,710
matches for all of this

485
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,640
so so you can see most of our taxes if
you can see it

486
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,850
uh... holiday on it

487
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,600
some sort of a recent

488
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,440
the scripts which says dr

489
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,840
if we look at our record please

490
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,890
about conduct

491
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,310
bruce do we know that students

492
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,200
that's really all that said

493
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,200
but make sure that every single state
houses

494
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,880
thought there was a few cases i think

495
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,210
elvis and ella met with a few cases

496
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,340
it's and that's the reason for that

497
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,600
scripts net executed some browsers about
it

498
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,120
so we want to make sure

499
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,200
taxes with a

500
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,840
as well

501
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,840
thirty percent of hiding anything

502
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,570
actually i wanted

503
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:20,020
or saigon issue collins and you can give
us a action

504
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:27,020
pollack are possible

505
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,030
what we'll do instead

506
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:43,030
it will send across gaza strip execute

507
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:47,409
out of the second one hosokawa's but
just look at the lower class people as

508
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:48,360
well

509
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,970
is the script

510
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,090
we don't jeopardize accused as a
comeback

511
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,270
if they're too

512
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:01,300
that's wonderful

513
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,740
when i was just one of the other
students the girls finds himself

514
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,590
this or that and that was something came
back

515
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,620
uh... he wasn't going to do it

516
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,720
the exact same

517
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,590
yet please rehearsals

518
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,760
what happens

519
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,570

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,810
s_b_a_ yesterday

537
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,440
in the south exit

538
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,299
so this is because it was it

539
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:37,299
are on the process today because our
exit

540
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:53,380
but it's a little bit

541
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,570
version of the hottest

542
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,940
continued but we don't

543
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,730
and somehow

544
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:10,620
this time instead of the store and i
think he's very good

545
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,670
so what that does is it was in the sense
of months

546
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:18,370
so this example

547
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:25,370
uh... user enters jimmy johnson is a

548
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,050
what this does is the agassi

549
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,760
people of users modifies

550
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,270
the simple but it's the same

551
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,980
like start

552
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:48,330
hotels are always

553
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,740
look more like one of the act

00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,330
mixture

556
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,520
that this is an assumption that if they
didn't

557
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:07,160
oversight and happy

change but the

562
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,840
darkness a sports car

563
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,320
it's a little of it

564
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,530
absolutely dangerous

565
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,970
oxygen possible answers

566
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:55,310
despite past

567
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,890
and so i was fixed

568
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:04,890
altogether

569
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,119
slide so what we're doing as well

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,419
astronauts

571
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:21,419
sorting out stratosphere

572
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:26,839
or stored procedures worked the same way

573
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:33,839
go wrong answer

574
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:41,229
the problem you're going to build

575
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:46,539
cumulative

576
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:53,539

accommodating t-ball

584
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:51,930
when we come back

585
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,099
the basic industries ltd

586
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:04,079
the interesting thing about this news

587
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,089
uh... street legal usa

588
00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:12,859
the reason it doesn't just because we
don't know

589
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:15,259
so specifically

590
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:16,579
you actually have to go

591
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:19,979
he will do it

592
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:22,299
if you look at the back here

593
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:29,299
i can go back

594
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,209
so this is actually about

595
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:49,910
national objected when people

596
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:56,910

597
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:03,909
street jeff

598
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:10,909
while is just wrong except it's not
actually get

599
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:20,389
but even imagine walking to the stand

600
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:22,749
we diseases

601
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:29,749
so that is i couldn't take it back to
the specific straight on that

602
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,759
final

603
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,499
but they don't suspect

604
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:43,609
exchange list of things

605
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:47,249
so before the books for data base fare

606
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:48,649
what did not respond to

607
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:55,649
like six thousand to put a rear springs

608
00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:01,599
if you see

609
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,380
this desk objected

610
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:13,380
you see any of those governors

611
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:29,729
so we we need something to check in

612
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:48,689
eagleburger get the developer

613
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:55,429
i know it

614
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:57,029
that cigarettes

615
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:04,029
that's a good looking at these two

616
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:13,549
to going back to you

617

pocketbook

618
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:04,749
as you can

619
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:07,609
really didn't exist

620
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:14,609
were sent with the patient

621
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:17,239

m_t_v_'s duff

623
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:24,799
that's right

624
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:28,959
it is quite legal process reports

625
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,129
deals with this for

626
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:34,789
well prepared

627
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:39,329
accuracy

628
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:40,799
so it was a blast

629
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:43,929
making up here

630
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:47,929
customer data

631
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:49,949
this is a problem

632
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:55,979
discoveries positions in phuket

633
00:40:55,979 --> 00:41:02,979
that's that's a lot of the

634
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:11,829
blackberryr system army base

635
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:34,219
we think it's basically the same

636
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:37,179
i remember correctly

637
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:44,179
juror expressed

638
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:52,329

two things first

642
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:42,069
firefox three

643
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:49,069
their firefox three change their
behavior itself

644
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:03,299
he sees pictures of us can reimbursed
three which comes out

645
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:07,699
problem but i think

646
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:14,699
we wanna hug

647
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:20,939
my day

648
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:27,939
and explain series

649
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,479
there's a whole series of these two
girls

650
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:41,479
i'd be looking for

651
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,169
uh... it's pretty

652
00:44:24,169 --> 00:44:27,539
you've been at the polls

653
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,509
because of the records for freedom

654
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:30,919
opt out

655
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,699
has been a cracker

656
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:37,849
thinking that if you want me to record
the returns false but

657
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:40,959
itni

658
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:44,689
so we can

659
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:51,689
we don't have it

660
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,109
uh... on this

661
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:04,109
auxiliaries and passover attack

662
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:15,069
thank you

663
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:21,689
while the site as well

664
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:26,789
they sell them

665
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:28,489
so they can see her

666
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:35,489
solicitors

667
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,599
so you know filter

668
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,499
so basically what lower property

669
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:58,079
if you know

670
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,759
if this if you don't have an almost over

671
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,719
hip hop over it

672
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,890
let's face it like this

673
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,609
what they had to get speakers please

674
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:19,609
as it is an example

675
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:34,849
but there's a difference

676
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:41,210
through diplomatic

677
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:48,210
research for each of them

678
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:05,909
seeking telugu

679
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:11,429
wasn't it

680
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:14,569
and i think this was a double

681
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:20,219
web that has allowed me to do

682
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:23,009
so the next time

683
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:27,259
used by the script executes a script as
an executed

684
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:31,029
however

685
00:47:31,029 --> 00:47:36,499
right now i'm going to talk about it

686
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:39,089
right and the results are going to be
seen

687
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:42,139
user doesn't make sense

688
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:47,889
or at any case chances the case for the
state taxes

689
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:49,359
case as well

690
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,189
executed

691
00:47:51,189 --> 00:47:58,189
could execute

692
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:09,399
for yeltsin

693
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:11,650
