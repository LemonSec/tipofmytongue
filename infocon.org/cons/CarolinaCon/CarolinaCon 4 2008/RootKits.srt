i don't think it's an income situations
let's not cancelling at the fact that so

170
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,400
it's time to make this is all

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,370
let sister said developments

172
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,260
parsons and really

173
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,610
the fact that makes the virus the first
we'll stop by

174
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,120
stumbles into the units were off

hiding self

178
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:18,700
and i actually had a moffat system but
it wasn't long want the software

179
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,390
keep economize on twitter

180
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,320
okay so it's not just a short

181
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,640
let's let's keep it longer term well our
sun microsystems bases compromise the

182
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,450

00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:36,709
several that

737
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:39,709
so let's look for a run for the u_s_
decline

738
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:45,729
so we have put up a virtual machine

741
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,690
so the details of the former replaces

742
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,749

743
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:02,400
what makes an interesting too many
instances these for divisive executed

745
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:05,539
what were the actual executions leo s

uh... esn accident technique

757

that's it

763
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,519
since you mentioned that you get a piece

764
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,050
okay you can see and shiznit boasted

766
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:17,099
enact these partners actually

767

genpact whatever d spread

769
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:25,000
so so

770
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,020
don't actually resulting talk like

771
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,810
answers to your you're going to both
sides

772
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,219
it's been suggested

773
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:34,649

00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:41,679
you know table data and do something
bizarre but

not rented henceforth

777
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:48,059
before partial without partners and

00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,940
let me know what to say let's talk about
educational level so we talked about the

799
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,799
summit right in the western section

800
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:56,609
response universal respect starts at the
top binaries hiding inside my garage

801
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:01,729

what remove the libraries life i did not

802

accept

803
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:05,149
tried hard

804
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:07,039
lynn

805
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,559
mhm indiagen applied earlier

806
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:10,430
the same answer

807
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:15,119
corker learned unaware

808
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,510
you use for artificial tears about that

809
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,189
detracting from where

810
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:24,489
wistfully plus a little bit more

811
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,329
polarized

812
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:29,159
marks also but most of his life personal
strength or method

813
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:33,469
of generally second executed brocade
actually

814
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:35,749
concept is simple an explanation

815
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:38,409
somewhat difficult practicality

816
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:43,689
oppressive alternative technologies is
very important that they watch

817
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:47,550
i all six of us is usually send data

818
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,059
that is not truthful

819
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:51,109
because of the world

820
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:53,130
expresso probably understands very well

821
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,169
when we return to our strategic

822
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:58,929
situation for multiple witnesses and
different angles and apparently asked

823
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:00,629
introductory looking for

824
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:04,729
two things don't match but let me ask
c_n_n_ yes the other kicking in separate

825
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:05,629
rooms

826
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,289
if you're going to be expressed an
interest rates

827
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:12,779
stories so let's meet its own

828
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:17,749
uh... the analogy is very similar to the
expressed executive committee

829
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:20,699
a number of questions arise in the
operating system already live from

830
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:22,969
potential problem i suppose

831
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:26,489
assembly directly to secure read only
operating systems that we will get on

832
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:27,409
the cd

833
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:31,479
at the same questions are asked to be
under my system record prospects

834
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:33,749
fear it will stop by the cowboys

835
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:35,639
the size of the market's harbor

836
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:37,169
i think that's the way

837
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:40,469
but you also attached is not my thing to
say okay

838
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:42,949
what really is obvious

839
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:46,589
compared to booking at from the
operating system levels and what's up

840
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,309

it doesn't matter if the star systems

00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:07,969
the result of this error when compared

used to have access to them directly
accessed part

00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:34,189
uh... so that they don't required

878
00:43:34,189 --> 00:43:38,129
uh... however approval rating is usually
done for almost thirty percent hike that

879
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:39,299
severe

00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:43,859
okay student

882
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:48,409
didn't do it wasn't worth the effort so
operating system itself

883
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:52,679
uh... because of the record infirmary
bypassing the secular memory

uh... that you're sleeping at night

886
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:02,539
officially reductions that i had to
gently go dear

887
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,879
uh... you trusted binaries compiled
offline statically linked into c_d_-rom

888
00:44:06,879 --> 00:44:08,139
and not safe tools

889
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:11,009
persist rules of the mystical

890
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:12,419
but what is the man systems

flagstar bank solicit molecules on our

892
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,869
i guess isn't amounts

893
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:21,829
realistically rigid as well as i think
it's really

894
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,149
too restrictive

895
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:27,879
uh... and westinghouse has a piano that
can never be who

896
00:44:27,879 --> 00:44:30,089
i gather cryptographic sessions together

897
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:33,239
compare that to get rid of the caches
and check the recent

898
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,479

899
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:37,849
uses and get to the currently rejected

900
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,309
spent it all

901
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,879
pat

902
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,639
standing over there

906
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,460
no i don't have to say

907
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,999
if you can come up with it

908
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:58,199
perversity catalogue copy statements at

909

910
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,649
hand-held something like that plane

911
00:45:07,649 --> 00:45:08,490
letter

912
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,739
very similar to the president is leading
to trust binaries

913
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:15,349
this hundreds libraries and not by it's
essentially get frostbite and i think

914
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,939
the fastest error

915
00:45:16,939 --> 00:45:21,499
steady compilation is mandatory fields
that we compile your binaries you're

916
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:25,469
going to use whatever is that almost
friday lunch so they would be subvert

917
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:26,409
that

918
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:29,169
uh... second big basket is it's a good

919
00:45:29,169 --> 00:45:36,169
and i think the checkered margaret

920
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:46,109
elliott about us

921
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:47,500
i wouldn't let us know

922
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,259
back in contact with the slaw c'est

923

his here

924
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:58,229
solve our country's

925
00:45:58,229 --> 00:45:58,939

abyss for his heel

929
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:12,009
so that it should be doable uh...

930
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:13,859
ivy here

931
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:15,280
saying this is an important

932
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,489
accidents

933
00:46:17,489 --> 00:46:18,479
pick it up

934
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:19,449
yourself

935
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:23,849
twenty exiles rumors had a wild stampede

stocks

938
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:31,919
so everybody soap to write a massive
litigations systems and we actually

939
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:32,880
modifies

941
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,220

942
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,119

943
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,220
specifies

944
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,839
completely awesome

945
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,439
lets us together

946
00:46:47,439 --> 00:46:49,799
destroyed that's awesome

947
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:51,709
prophesied haskell

hitler

950
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:58,909
but if done right it it probably cancel

951
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:01,549
these higher

952
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:03,939
soap for that

953
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:08,009
it's great that is the next year

954
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:11,690
governor i've never really cares about
it bob dole optiplex

955

internet

956
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:17,059
didn't you tell me notes on occasion
wanted

957
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:21,690
what senseless mattel species

958
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,680
drugs is good

959
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,269
or walking

960
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:29,269
etc

961
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:32,109
uh... sooner or later detection

962
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:36,039
significantly more difficult say
fighters who works that we like crap

963
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:38,059
tech modification of the project

964
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,359
yes is the cheapest

965
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,049
suspected redirects

966
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:44,549
at those addresses that are in that
table are out of range

967
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:48,479
it's probably a problem what is the
checkpoints to completely advocating

968
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,079
secretive sweet peppers

969
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,109
work that way

970
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:56,659
we have to move out later check at the
table itself is in the appropriate

971
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:57,210

972
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,099

973
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,439
criterion it begin

974
00:48:01,439 --> 00:48:06,089
and thirty obscene nothing can be used
for promoting interactivity

975
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:09,079
right here

976
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,199
but perhaps the most effective way to
get to the employer

977
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,629
whose city dots less

978
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:18,989

bhai site

981
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:31,779
dot so you seems very nice

982
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:33,560
apps detecting details

983
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,039
first to arrive a distinct advantage

984
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:39,349
uh... i hope he is the second part of
that is not subverted

985
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:43,259
and gives renounces interesting that
resurgence of threat analysis numerous

986
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:48,359
every threat analysis that addresses
vetting process operative

987
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:51,779
so threadless interest or process at all
that

988
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:56,159
it is possible new rate all processes
elsewhere says that the other

989
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,419
if this information doesn't match
results normal process walking with

990
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:02,969
situation grandpa piper

991
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:07,299
over this could be several hundred
advocates

992
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:11,399
and that it was a personal reference
those titans so there is sixty in the

993
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:15,279
general permanent space looking for a
ex-convicts signatures is very similar

994
00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:17,919
to those co-processor object

995
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:21,009
first gentlemen we're looking for things
that look like processed

996
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:25,249
your final and it's not due process was
you're probably has a particular

997
00:49:25,249 --> 00:49:28,059
determine location in memory for the
process i think is linked to the

998
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:29,849
external process was

999
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:33,819
and fine discrepancies most likely
arkansas

1000
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:35,799
uh... and the last uh...

1001
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:38,190
stories that you should be on

1002
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,099
gets to be analytical

1003
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:44,129
uh... environs analysis which is
actually pretty cool idea jacket by an

1004
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:47,759
amazing runtime that have been trying to
get rid of my heart

1005
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:48,819
okay most of the right

1006
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,450
to write about it hard to keep a reject
the colonel

1007
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,609
specifically certain sections of the

the concept of a trusted but

1034
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,910

implemented systems that must maintain a

00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:14,910

this is the same o s forty years of date

1046
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,729
so three seven seven

1047
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:49,389
so we choose that act was threatened

1052

does not have to drive through the

1053

uh... some undercover titan baseball

1058
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:17,149
so uh...

1059
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:18,820
you had to go to our techniques

1060
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,139
granite counter thread of point four

1061

executed synchronize threatening or

1062
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:26,629
and encountered results at least you
indicates that

1063
00:52:26,629 --> 00:52:29,259
you don't want most fourth-quarter

1071
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:50,859
time to do it now

1072
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:52,299
as good as that is a lot

1073
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:56,009
it's considered time anyways let me know

1074
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:59,469
then this past week fauci director
processor

1075
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:01,500
so a lot of processes that box

1076
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,889
but the vienna

1077

abiam literature right

1082
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:17,069

last not least here pensions

1105
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,329

interview another witness later when he
