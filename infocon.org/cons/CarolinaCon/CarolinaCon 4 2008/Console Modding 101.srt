uh... basically a model

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,920
particularly right hand side

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,010
holding

23
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,600
uh... was a hole in the long even small

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,180
these days and days dates

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,520
both very small our

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,400
usable also

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,180
uh... and you can buy it

28
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,880

boxes powerful stuff

30
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,659
miloslovic it's not that hard

31
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:08,659
oscar two dollars for reads that helps
the process

32
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:11,559
ideally in these

33
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,789
individuals

34
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,669
series purposes

35
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,219
which returns

36
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,889
piracy

37
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,149
pasand

38
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:24,569
mia

39
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,090
terrorism comes home on anything

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,459
probably the only copies

41
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,369
of video games that you know

42
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,439
reasons

43
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,939
uh... they're in high school

44
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,299
format model

45
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,709
mrs

46
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,539
more fancy formats to get a little bit
volunteers

47
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,750
uh... there's a lot

48
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,849
people in the council in st

49
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,869
renaming examination actually believe
that you can

50
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,229
incensed me

51
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:54,519
custom applications around myself

52
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,039
we have found any point piracy

53
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,149
financially

54
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:01,180
that's true but i think there's a very
distinct difference

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,389
twenty grams

56
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,519
people verbal

57
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,509
and when i get to talk about the week
urine

58
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:11,229
all talk about what

59
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,159
so the company tried very hard stuff
obscene

60
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,479
install homeroom

61
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,269
softwares

62
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:25,269
advances don't try hard enough

63
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,969
let's talk about house obj forming this
viewing cryptology already probably

64
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:31,479
nobody's characters

65
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,209
narrowest something

66
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,409
traditional encryption technology cmca

67
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,429
basically appear what's your sense is
that since the bomb

68
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,829
and charlie's

69
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,599
charlie can read the message that

70
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,159
because he doesn't have universal
message

71
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,749
which is what bob has just perfect he
said

72
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,979
secret service

73
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,419
when you apply traditional into trouble

74
00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:00,779
encryption technology to gain council's
in new york towards effective fails

75
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:01,619
measure

76
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:04,279
accompanying or don't open if it works

77
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,349
in that realm of content

78
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,859
incursion what happened

79
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:10,729
told mary it's not an hour excellent
fame

80
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,809
it's a waste of time

81
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:16,120
uh... so what happens in the case comes
full citizens

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,229
palaces monster that's it for what was
the lesson she also said

83
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:24,770
it all you can read this properly so you
should use this through interests you

84
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,860
and say hello novel which was which

85
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,750
in there all three were apparently
defeats the purpose of

86
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:39,560
pat's message again

87
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,009
how and why it feels from councils

88
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,639
with counsel gets off work on cations

89
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,189
talent for it

90
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:52,720
whole something we can

91
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,529
we for instance i can actually take it

92
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,400
cd-r but my computer restaurants for the
next few

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,530
it work

94
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,809
three civil works

95
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:05,349
contenders

96
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:08,929
ideas here's a couple middle east he
says i have to have inside my

97
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:13,479
applications my programs

98
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,479
families

99
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,919
nintendo also

100
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,099
doesn't check for probabilities

101
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,860
standard bearers

102
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,459
well give that's working

103
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,469
uh... developers replacing

104
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:29,419
interests as well

105
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,409
smarmy

106
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:36,020
uh... libraries provided woods cross
highfalutin sisters wedding but that is

107
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,300
this different why brief ulc

108
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,319
for interpreting it

109
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,330
uh... difficulties would use the same
wire info

110
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:53,330
parmar dot com

111
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,339
uh... so

112
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,309
these flyers to use of different systems
what the what this means basically is

113
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,650
that

114
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,649
food the best way g and four million
windows machine might actually exporting

115
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,139
to see more of them

116
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,080
went great

117
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,180
this didn't happen

118
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,660
we if the student councils that could
happen indications postage

119
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:20,149
portable council which the initial want
to believe that was found was through d

120
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,009

baseball with stars above

123
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:31,259
the roots of extra stuff of uh...
profile processes off a couple of times

124
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,380
and eventually they probably want to do
it

125
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,110
balloon

126
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,889
for more of a scale secret indeed
compiled which is another wave pius was

127
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,990
later found what happened with these

130
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,309
uh... fewer people are really

131
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:55,319
and what are you going to use for me to
use the consul forward help solving was

132
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:55,710

yediyat remember that

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,909
pointless

138
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:08,840

210
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,510
the r_c_g_a_ or encryption about this is

219
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,520
was

220
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,139

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:36,220
the software reforms that standards slim

512
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,070
the response monitors software partner
of course that's what it does

513
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,890
is uses the same sort of thing since
that's the problem-solving

514
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,970
can't ingles overflows certain parts of
the brain or how you get home to the

515
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,630
council

516
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,540
once custom wasn't custom firmware

517
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,590

518
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,620
uh...

519
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,010
aren't personally says that the ubuntu
because i think singer council's meet

520
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,620
with him

521
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,000

523
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,410

ways with that the other thing it's the

524
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,990
software that doesn't

525
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,679
newlands works won't be always disliked

526
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,390
won't necessarily

527
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,419
the state has a lot of

528
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,900
delisle youth have bigger participant

529
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,680
needed do more with the networking
because the server on it

530
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,910
websites from that direction

531
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,200
stands counterpart

532
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,670
it's decreases paradise consulates fear
they will return to start offers

533
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:59,670
anyways words marshall product that you
can

534
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,990
uh... like i said

535
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,070
for attendance

536
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,660
researchers or too great

537
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,429
they use the sax verification procedure
was consulates and in cuba

538
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,870
and literally list

539
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,090
after three weeks pirate software
scissor all planned out signing putting

540
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,320
all this money security measures to
prevent me from running fast

541
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,210
possible

542
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,310
machine harpercollins

543
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,520
did nothing experience in the end the
partial yes that's a good witness for

544
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,090
her

545
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,860
found a way to run the risk for

546
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,580
they were going to the following
possible interest first

547
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,710
what they had committed hurdles there's
been a retired and

548
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,000
that is the worst

549
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,080
made for us

550
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,540
consul

551
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,990
that's can you explain to me

552
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,240
a dataset

553
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,230
are really tight

554
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,549
the revolution was a very interesting

555
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:00,650
i don't know why i think we had

556
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,799
but that's not what you say no one's it
doesn't endorse believe that all of them

557
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,460
with

558

560
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:16,150
patasse left-wing belief about this

561
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,020
yet ahead

562
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,830
statewide only

569
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,929
you don't have much of before

570
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:41,900
like i said

dead or alive

931
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:13,729
tactic and more magic

932
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:18,779
yes the offense to interview the moment

933
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:21,490

934
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:27,079
well illustrated by the here

935
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:28,559
building and refusing

936
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:34,849

940
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:42,039
he says they are here

941
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:46,879
this is how you look at the bottom

942
00:47:46,879 --> 00:47:48,479
cases

943
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:53,049
so what do you want giving me is a
meaningful work

944
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:55,639
various things i'd be more ad

945
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:02,639
for instance the hardest hit boxes
walking instead

946
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:05,959

00:48:05,959 --> 00:48:07,569
the hardest ransacked

948
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:10,709
as possible performance

949
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:14,570
and it prevents me from taking it out
