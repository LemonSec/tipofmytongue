in which they catch a username and
password

67
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:38,569

tight-lipped oracle

87
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,030
make dozens of them a little simple
clear

88
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,150
social studies

89
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,249

00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:50,770
fellow artists about it

92
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,219
basically just

93
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:56,079
true concept profits between on hormones

94
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,590

undeserving units sold left on and that
she was

98
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,460
when i was in the bushes based on
naturalist because of this

99
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,310
indeed victimized

100
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,189
went out and tires that are somehow find
it would not have an application

101
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,139
begun strada classes you see the bomb

102
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,339

103
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,959
d is going to be used to go to talk
about before

104
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,199
you know

105
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,009
vichy la jolla straw

106
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:34,989
and uh...

107
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,379
so they don't like wes insurance yet

108
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,709
truancy

109
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,249
this particular case

110
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,409
desert rose and her

111
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,610
it is such a database

112
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,949
massless four-party comes in

113
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,669
so i was just sitting there

114
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,800
and had the code is going to happen

115
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,490
and that's not something comes up

116
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,539
accuser

117
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,149
and i think it's a normal webapp could
be flattered to be moving

118
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,460
needed access and some

119
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,219
informations and richard

120
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:04,979
also that's what was going to ask you to
develop

121
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:11,979
datamonitor

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,459
it usually goes to use the word

123
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,560
uh... prostate screening it's been in a

124
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,100

application shuttle island

127
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,759
till i come home paragraphs

128
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,449
liberty seems to work

129
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:29,280
because that

130
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,240
include a lot of characters

131
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,610
an estimated stored in the background

132
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,629
so when you told us all

133
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,370
be safe

134
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,089
and i think he and his soul

135
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,819
estimate no more contact silverstein
stored in database

136
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,689
income that's worthwhile he stopped

137
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,789
that's a little bit

138
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,769
that was used

139
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:53,049
html javascript flash in the database
and his excuse

140
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:59,689
loser loser could be done at this point
probability

141
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,360
reflect it has nothing to do with it

142
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,789
today's

143
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,089
what happens this

144
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,840
the apt

145
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,960
begin putting out

146
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,089
what most things that give you that i
think it's a little something its

147
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:18,339
immediate sources request response the
immediate effect

148
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,409
were also looking

149
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:20,680
howell

150
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,740
delivers

151
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,149
simple genius

152
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:25,479
once you have that one of them there

153
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,299
how do you how to take action

154
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:32,529
here we go for a scenario

155
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,059
how much after a first time

156
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:41,800
because tomorrow from all security
council compatible are ready to listen

157
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,289
dollars cattle were sold out

158
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,610
some of the basis of what you know

159
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,259
so this is a little more out-patient

160
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,379
mycompany watch fire

161
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,049

168
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,280

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,090
and they will see what happens by
injecting

170

00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,779
well with all of the warm

173
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,590
here's what i'm talking about

174
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,600
this may be a tough case for some

175
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,900
won't get posted taking place in the
background

176
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,919
so it may be

177
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,290
although a bit of your comments as well

178
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,870
the banking maybe checking

179
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,190
is great for doing what it right out so
that you must not comment on that using

180
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,420
extraordinary

181
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,640
as long as you look at the june
fourteenth season

182
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,270
cannot

teeming with certain something

189
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,950
so long

190
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,930
what you're doing this may be just fine

191
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,870
you see here scotia

192
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,660
which isn't a great time in search
results

193
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,390
than they were put up

194

195
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,220
just give me a a twenty-year here

people usually intact

198
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,310
so it looks dinner at sort of all of

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,970
not army

204
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,480
ya put on the search

205
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,860
so i can go either

206
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,410
commit roll tide

207
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,940
extensively

208
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,880
it wasn't necessarily

209
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,080
directly

210
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,550

he didn't get the classes equals two
personal cost

213
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,610
you can trust sandbagged charlie trie

214
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,340
sixty-two here

215
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,400
but says it's not just imposed on the
web

216
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,170
you probably when you are well here
because we weren't there

217
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,700
dobutamine

218
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,350
since you were going on

219
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,660
so it's not just on

220
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,890
inputs are sponsoring

221
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,030
so that's where that

222
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,720
the second point is that i did not try
to do that for a long policies they had

223
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,980
to

224

she which

take the maps

249
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,030
however certain areas

250
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,279
this commission decided

251
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,520
radiation they'll actually

252
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,980
document model

253
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,260
at this particular

254
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,140
so the ski season this

255
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,360
sing this table and

256
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,600
mistake casey action

257
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,850
works for a week

258
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,080
so as lay down

259
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,450
personal issues are

260
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,480
will be a bit and it would look if you
look at the backpack

261
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,150
it's also a

262
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,080
you know a little more snacks

263
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,080
summoned an administration division in
the past

264
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,860
someone who first time

265
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,000
say here religion stomach bug

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,560
obvious fact

267
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,380
you can see here that's true

268
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,470
this particular block

269
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,950

294
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,010
high-tech revenue allocation for having

295
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,220

it's publicly available

297
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,899
gandhiji here's the other

298

299
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,620
and off

300
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,630

basically whatever's in the science

301
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,880
writer tag

302
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,360

yahoo dot still panama stuff

304
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,280
so it's going to do it would be on and
here are coming up right now

305
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,500
alone

306
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,800
so these are the interpretation

307
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,990
here's a four matches coming out of my
sites the potential to be a

308
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,770
cross-section

309
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:16,360
constantly username password

310
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,950
the folder misguided

311
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,610
texan information

312
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,859
it seems that my fica taxes

313
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:22,950
so once

314
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,310
so much puzzle is the help of my
information

315
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,380
and then delete sex abuse cases

316
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,030
our partner in the whole number in there

317
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:38,030
understand i do we have been changed

318
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,750
so this is a single innocent souls lot

319
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,000
sits at the same

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
all of you listen to come here

321
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,680
once considered paste therefore tired

322
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,060
you see it now at

323
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,510
this is what he's missing which it
really appreciate that

324
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,070
it is ok

325
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,000
actually

326
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,589
then that's what they need

327
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,220
suspects

328
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,469
pgc eight of the flu taxes say most of
the things that

329
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,990
now upto

330
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,890
you could have kept it left me

331
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,900
you could email you can do little

332
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,250
even when he says he can actually
manipulate therefore

333
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,090
on i'm thinking

334
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,510
formulating or sec

335
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,090
of what mister

336
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,050
so long

337
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,950
so you might have

338
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,590
part-time

339
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,100
but also the modern the information

340
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,789
it's not about him

341
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:16,709
yes your honor

so publicly

444
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,660
analytical

445
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,810
i think uh...

446
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:17,630
thanks the real answer is

447
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,720

right cody road allocation properly

451
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,420
now i think there are some steps you can
take

452
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,890
you know that this is an answer

453
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,700
why are we hope we won't do it it's more
attacker

454
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,130
uh... course you are awesome

455
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,570
let's go approximate time together

456
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,240
tonight or what we were brought to you
don't do anything

457
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,930
solos

458
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,799
regarding

459
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,180
three hundred

460
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,950
drops all of the

461
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,420
but it's how you can

462
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,650
accounting doesn't it

463
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:12,650
tax information to answer questions

464
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,870

465
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,929
people only so i would say neta

466
00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:26,690
denial of green lara stop

467
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,330
need moral sense it is safe and reliable
honest and say

468
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,460
hacker safe

469
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,400
now

470
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,700
well there is

471
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,860
their frontline

472
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,340
the

473
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,460
the courses you don't want you to us
that sandy west that's almost all of it

474
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,430
the mysterious

475
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,260
if i'm going to be

476
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,850
there are a lot of the are really

477
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,560
under which i wasn't going to do the
right

478
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,400
for example we myself opt-out migration
must dot com

479
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,410
animals dot com

480
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,220
yeah exactly

481
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,799
what they did is they are welcome

482
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,640
what did you decide

483
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,180
they allow someone to do

484
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,070
third-party advertiser

485
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,340
so they haven't either

486
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,840
so that young talent

487
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,980
so if you're using a gigantic stops at
that time

488
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,890
emirates susan

489
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,960
now however

490
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,950
matsushita facial is done

491
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,470
that's also the most communism h

492
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,210
discoloration on a different avenues
that ended two years

493
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,850
and i hope in these losses

494
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,160
basically

495
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,920
in the process starts indigenous all
wildlife settlements overwhelmingly

496
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,100
typecast

497
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:57,100
itself

498
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,300
doesn't reflect

499
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,530
so invest in a really good question

500
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,980
taking place in the area

501
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,990
is going to happen efficient ac

502
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,879
and uh...

503
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,999
so this is a lot of slavery

504
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:14,600
there's a lot so i don't have to go
before this

505
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,130
and uh...

506
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,480
by having you know

507
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,830
resistant

508
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,330
main for him

509
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,050
sydney

510
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:35,090
all right i said to this is the same
time what happens is that something

511
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,520
they did something

512
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,970
you see right here

513
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,480

575
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,690
comentarios well

576
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,660
this is an easy as these paintings which
is first

577
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,960
but done

578
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,100
what exactly do they look let's get out
of here

579
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,120
used to

580
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,600

tobacco's

586
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,840
and didn't want to do appear interests
as compared to choose

587
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,050
so i just think it's a number of
coverage

588
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,930
and they need this difference in the
plot sonography literacy trends that you

589
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,500
can see

590
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,270
how approved lifting generated as well
and that is a strong enough

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,270
doing out here

596
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:37,270
and sending it on

you

601
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,680
so that this is a

river having

607
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,450
that's probably what works well i hope
not

608
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,810
because this is an

609
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,190
and i i guess the same thing as well

610
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:35,800
performer custom-made cage see how it
generate

611

say hold on a creator

612
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,290

you cannot come up with

and on

617
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,409
