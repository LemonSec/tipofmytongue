176
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,169
and i don't think we're going to be
addressed

177
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,419
guitar credits to st

178
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,020
nin you don't believe it but it is a day

179
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,340
and so here is that what you need to use
the media

180
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,289
concede anything it's just

181
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:19,289
i think this is work

182
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:23,860
undeniably

183
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,009
he wrote this i don't want to be
addressed comes along i'd be interested

184
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,229
in he took the window but i could just

185
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,569
so therefore we need something like that

186
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,840
aba i'd altogether as you might be a
good thing for you

187
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,690
through minimum

188

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,430
there's basically this uh...

193
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,859
i think i guess

194
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:56,309
but that's all it was that this is all
that

195
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,789
maybe people

196

slots your ideas as

222
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,130
will responses cases like this

223
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,720

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,700
because that really does exist

228
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,770
it is susceptible to our problems

229
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,170
