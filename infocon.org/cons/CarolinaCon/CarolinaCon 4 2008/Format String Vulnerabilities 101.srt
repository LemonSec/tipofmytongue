1
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,520
umbrella and what is this year's
mysterio

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,929
for fortune five

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,580
at least for w

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,140
actually gave my resignation

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,169
change jobs

6
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,929
it

7
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,509
case

8
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:30,579
that's also a lot and research uh...

9
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,170
research reveals how much do

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,750
we don't make any money you spend all
their spare time

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,970
so that is right because of the
privilege specials

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,710
actually for security

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,200
flushes judith others

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,200
family hundreds of items in the hands of
the security professionals knowledge

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,880
so this presentation

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,870
we're going to discuss the building
blocks of

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,299
for mister obama louise

18
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:09,090
missus conferences comprehensive
understanding of four mr four buildings

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,940
developer

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,689
recovers

21
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,810
advance the application process

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,020
in his very demonstrations

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,390
so hopefully one of the problems

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,950
of course all the information provided
is presentations for educational

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,890
purposes only

26
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,530
call almond crash everything that you
are present

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,100
lawyers please

28
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,220
family

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,980
sources here

30
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,080
what does it for ministry

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,500
well for mastering is a_b_c_ specifier

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,900
this applied to a function of skull
career

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:57,380
what format wit u

34
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,830
spire into exile

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,070
they functioned

36
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,180
the goal is

37
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,770
you want to know how i would say that

38
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,829
as an example of a day in one house into
a farmhouse into the street

39
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,039
intel of what

40
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,619
four japanese veto whether it's in
string format

41
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:16,590
of america's format

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,499
hexadecimal

43
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:22,559
in other formats for his first part of
us

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,740
onto the industries that started

45
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,560
was luckier his stuff person

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,799
s disappears from helpful

47
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,969
texas for accessible

48
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,859
use them

49
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:38,309
off susan is a especially for mastering
specifier actually

50
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:41,089
catering cannot all of it

51
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:44,839
from the function

52
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:49,790
stuff ourself comment

53
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,099
and this is all for restaurants first
artists just small sample

54
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,539
the main reasons for that

55
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,689
patient or person s person

56
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:03,259
next to process

57
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,699
default she's

58
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:06,509
that's not all of them

59
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:10,979
but it was for instance the stars

60
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,389
so closely involved know your words only
come from

61
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,469
florida's first discovered they call in
september nineteen ninety nine

62
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,449
uh... ever six like it was really soon

63
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:23,319
two thousand

64
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,689
and as for all that you have to be too
dot six

65
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,989
says that a few hundred eighty

66
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,749
three or four hundred

67
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:34,979
for restaurants have actually been a
probably although it's been a problem

68
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:41,979
so that they are the all this is your
standard or what or where in papua

69
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,540
most for ministry moses

70
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,709
for us in the eighties

71
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,059
environment a lot less element within
the want elvira

72
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,469
our presentation then we're gonna

73
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,709
focus on the winter

74
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,849
there's been a lot of total units

75
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,699
there's a lot less file-format st

76
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:02,519
and we've been reporting

77
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,420
so what is it one st mobility

78
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,299
well we were all instruments

79
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,009
so what we're going to come into play
here

80
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:12,160
what what leslie won't notice called
programmer

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,149
but does not support at four restaurants
s fire

82
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:18,179
in the art of functions

83
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:21,530
the reason for that her day uh... taking
shortcuts

84
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,990
he's being lazy work history one

85
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,869
experience

86
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:30,280
now before we go before i i want to
mention i'm on a programmer

87
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,750
also on my friends and sit down and take
home with her and classes

88
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,860
so i could actually get my skills so sql
lewinsky plus plus

89
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,919
sites

90
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,789
so our programmers like approach this
whole thing

91
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,020
with very little furry batra

92
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,429
so i'll try to make this whole
presentation

93
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:51,889
made away from here

94
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,639
seat for renewed

95
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,710
into a carrying on a slow it down to the
press

96
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,250
vision greasy exploit carried out

97
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,090
here senator wallop forever and i just
seems like twenty pages

98
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,840
what the hell sandy

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,620
we're not going to do that were actually
pointed curiosity accidents for example

100
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,939
abilities

101
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:13,779
eugene walcott shrines

102
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:18,340
insurance ian

103
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,379
so-and-so more foreign aid

104
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,160
definitely a little more for a broader
audience understands these things

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,899
through sort of bottom where it all out
and yet

106
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,960
we're gonna have to mister koppel of
exploits in real life

107
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,060
slots for us

108
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,110
let's look at

109
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,080
some kind of suspicion to have a little
bit understated

110
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,389
understand where the format string sets
of fires in word format wobbly comes

111
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,340
from

112
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,939
so here's a because they've been really
was

113
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,830
nothing to do this for the city's
colorado rushing to do that

114
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,360
have a cup of coffee and as per unit

115
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,050
this is the actual parties

116
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,779
format since that's where

117
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,259
for all

118
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,520
function for that

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,319
incinerator process

120
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,580
before this is a this argument

121
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,380
protest alphabet use this reform asked
us for our listeners tax

122
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,809
persistent

123
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:17,699
incorrect use of this business right
here really differences

124
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,989
as you can see them from the function of
for mentions that so far from disease

125
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:24,159
doesn't comply

126
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,779
if you're wrong

127
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,739
so let's go ahead and uh...

128
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:33,620
store also said she wouldn't sure she's
solution

129
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,620
have an understanding that

130
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:54,489
list of issues please

131
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,960
politically correct

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,580
pass

133
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,800
the infamous

134
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,479
and alice

135
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,500
little world quite normal

136
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,610
if we pass

137
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,900
numeric data

138
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,379
the periphery populist meredith

139
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,370
if we pass

140
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,259
for master unspecified

141
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,520
it often so sincere texting

142
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,680
nothing special

143
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,680
so let's go ahead

144
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,649
past what world

145
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:42,549
critical programs

146
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,539
testing their data

147
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,310
to declare program out

148
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,810
meridia

149
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:54,580
sources fulfill breakdown

150
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,129
marinas enough

151
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,129
standard text

152
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:02,449
reprocessed stack

153
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,319
process set

154
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,319
that's all for mastering mobile that's

155
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,189
usually the only two more behind the
scenes

156
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,169
enthusiastic fans

157
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:22,169
let's move over the next level

158
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,879
exploiting his boyhood so what can

159
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,159
attacker disappear

160
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,130
and it's always there

161
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,940
it's really easy

162
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,129
how to specify reflect on the program

163
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,830
heard come fall

164
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,659
he sold it

165
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,060
attackers using percent

166
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,140
and reading process

167
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,560
you know this is numbers we can bash

168
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,090
if we would using vs

169
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,310
estab

170
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,970
take those numbers

171
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,690
and evaluate those cleaners member

172
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,430
will go to that location member
interests are reading at that point

173
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,540
in recent memory to look at all but it
was yours

174
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,830
sobers aspen intrigued

175
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,130
is even funner

176
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,490
it heated mirrors count

177
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,740
of all else massage

178
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,720
alternet execution

179
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,030
into his personal also to my idol stack
is important to remember

180
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,400
but instead of reading it or actually

181
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,310
point that can remember about that

182
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,590
so you see these three things we can

183
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,790
readings that

184
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,230
ratri parat

185
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,160
reveals that

186
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,870
read a from memory

187
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,880
right now

188
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,230
so were his these three madness
presentations we proceed forward

189
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,020
buses may seven through this to carry
out these attacks

190
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,540
closely and guess what

191
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,350
noticeable differences

192
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,570
believer in this format

193
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:01,570
it's a exist

194
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,510
the sperm right here

195
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,850
so if we put former mistress pacifiers

196
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,890
blueprint

197
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,060
it'll actually three consecutive years
ready to go into the zero two zero two

198
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,720
zero two

199
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,460
bolstering the data

200
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,810
if we need all actually

201
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,470
promises yet

202
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,840
or a couple times

203
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,800
you can see it actually changed nothing
from the same implications of tape with

204
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,580
that

205
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,740
uh... really readings in the process

206
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,600
process that is a very dynamic part of a
member

207
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,839
so it can change

208
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,600
our program here show several strong
that it can alter change change

209
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,439
celeste taken a consideration

210
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,750
newsgroup of carrying out exports

211
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,300
thomas faces right now

212
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,430
the next four years

213
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,380
as we read from the stack

214
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,920
we had a really good memory locations
that were given to us on staff

215
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,400
so the trackers goal is can we put our
own data on the sack

216
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,950
and it's quite calm a lot of times would
you

217
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,450
input data

218
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,640
that it is the world stack

219
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,699
so effect a killer function

220
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:16,790
but here in putting data into

221
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,660
stores they don't stack so all can we
put that he wants that

222
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,930
read down to we find a date yet

223
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,400
and worry that as a member

224
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,360
basically given us

225
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,360
the lead to right part remember we can
control those pointers that we can make

226
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,019
yenar formal program

227
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:36,889
are easily

228
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,040
has that problem

229
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,430
lives and work with these

230
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,730
four days on the stash

231
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,070
when we go private

232
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,220
burritos often x

233
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,320
four one four one four one four one

234
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,850
so now we will

235
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,730
interfaces for is that

236
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,010
equivalent to a memory address

237
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,930
potentially redirected every actress

238
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,130
and that's what we do some exploring
remembering

239
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,770
wounded as uh...

240
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:15,770
actually

241
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,350
we have a couple chichi speeds through
this

242
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,660
ingredient

243
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,540
so this right here has asked the
shooting right here

244
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,490
is actually equal to the cigarette at
seven seventy four seven six seven three

245
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,640
oh

246
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,190
so important issues with an address it
really doesn't exist in memory

247
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,060
provides for every seven seventy four
seven six seven zero

248
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,920
we change this to a task

249
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,370
and oprah

250
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,940
insulin we've read that to reposition
our star treatment at every location

251
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,360
continually until it is not white

252
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,739
okay so there there will be over a week

253
00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:01,140
part remembered trauma memory address
that we've agreed

254
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,580
so you say ahh well what about his past
like a great story and to keep him on

255
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:12,580
the bus

256
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,400
having fun with no no i mean people
experience working with me

257
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,200
all right

258
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,640
there's only a small group of people
actually seeing the sex

259
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,190
passed by logging on

260
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,310
promotions

261
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,280
for get started

262
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,390
dot

263
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:46,390
channels

264
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,250
internal sources

265
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,040
explained the story

266
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,960
the first four ministry bono yahoo com
cn

267
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,230
wasn't nobel's lol

268
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,760
so i have

269
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,970
the only thing i can do

270
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,830
upon stack

271
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,140
attracted by the dataset

272
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,089
but i think it was so far from the
starting point and i sort of

273
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,840
person exciting

274
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,520
reform dot they are

275
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,860
so the only thing i think that was
reached

276
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,650
reads works great memories

277
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,270
securely

278
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,850
reason was that

279
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,700
psychomotor also book

280
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,180
therefore constrained by the can't do
much with eighty two dash

281
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:54,060
subcontract novell

282
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,790
on the other all about

283
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,170
advice starts with barack

284
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,760
end up

285
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,320
nobel released service pack two

286
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,600
uh... security dash

287
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,600
i think one sees what they call it

288
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,720
so we've got

289
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,810
sequence didn't ask

290
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,410
it would actually come up and as you can
see unseen residents that

291
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,760
right there

292
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,380
so the only thing to do with the
original although he was freed from sac

293
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,710
they release a patch

294
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,250
five dollars in taxes all my system

295
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,020
instead of accident

296
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,980
alone

297
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,430
failure

298
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,910
actually it works

299
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,130
me

300
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,220
so now i read your art remembering

301
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,140
so it kinda

302
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,730
though but also look at you

303
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,190
already made a problem

304
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,500
this inaugural go ahead with racism

305
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,230
four months go by

306
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,080
statistics

307
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:24,080
do not one of the let's add what i meant
they took it seriously

308
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,030
what's your life

309
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,670
and uh...

310
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,960
the release of the fact that

311
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,000
faces a little bit about alimony fix
things that's that's that's the way they

312
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,840
are

313
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,290
soda and download and install it at
least i didn't make the problem worse

314
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,610
needed six

315
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,860
some pretty much pistonsfan we're
looking at almost a year

316
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,760
another rehearsal guys you obviously
don't care

317
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,560
said she thought she remembered and lisa
price for

318
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,070
so i a comeback safe

319
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,860
also rehearsal

320
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,780
go i think we should watch for him

321
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,030
are you reading this sort of all the
changes that you know i think this is

322
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,210
serious

323
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,750
cannot lead

324
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,329
slowly slowly

325
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,200
by israel

326
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,709
friday and i sat down saturday and then
you know i'm certain

327
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,600
how can i make a right

328
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,340
path

329
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,780
so the was out there so it seemed like
it

330
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,970
sooner

331
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,750
businesses this is all i A

332
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,100
so up

333
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,720
i sat down started dating to everybody
has to be sold and they don't want me to

334
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,810
see

335
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,760
especially remote

336
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,850
considerable best

337
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,830
number johanna

338
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,770
so i a thousand

339
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,990
rohan receipt

340
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:55,990
in memory delight

341
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:07,740
datatype his character gene can lead to
hold on the all team

342
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,309
so there is a real issue here

343
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,900
let's listen to the issue comes up is
far too do you want to ask you to you

344
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,820
want

345
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,820
psychopath subsidy

346
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,980
galled

347
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,860
let less

348
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,940
the here

349
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,620
well

350
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,549
that israel is

351
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,640
cases i show you know on a sunday said

352
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,890
what i think

353
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,680
please introduce

354
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,000
politics let's see

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
i'd be delighted to hear

356
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,440
uh... with some of the advantages there

357
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,630
dvd literally set their own

358
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,040
has hit the fan

359
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,740
what press

360
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,770
and there are

361
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,010
yeah right

362
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,590
you found out all the time

363
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,590
but i don't think i know

364
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,750
no i don't want any fathers i usually do
most looking for the soft enough

365
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,080
means-testing

366
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,970
and we'll talk about that at the end

367
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,650
we get there

368
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,970
okay associates

369
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:47,030
right here right now when we talk about
reading from minnesota and disassembled

370
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,200
right andrea

371
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,850
species

372
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:56,850
however conscious

373
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,280
care we're going to use this program
here

374
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,230
were also

375
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,789
bring apology but

376
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:13,179
were not open at all and i want you to
see it

377
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,870
actually in the program

378
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:23,870
sigchi house function takes place what
happens

379
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:10,030
saluting the implication

380
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,590
right here is beginning the hymn
invocation

381
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,120
as i mentioned a research free

382
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,410
in recent years old

383
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,820
small white which would be right here
that's the mall white

384
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,940
nasa operating story from memory we
always a little more wide

385
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,600
let's go ahead and

386
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,820
do some uh...

387
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,110
remembered

388
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,810
as i've mentioned

389
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,170
the output

390
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,010
of the conscious

391
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,420
characters are polygamy

392
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,950
anasquan

393
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,170
you can see the

394
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,080
point right here eight characters

395
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,010
and change that are

396
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,980
we do a percent

397
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,430
come over here in single wrote an email
address

398
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,800
zero eight

399
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,250
take note that the last three

400
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,810
perceived replaceable regular rate for
whites as well

401
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,770
sorority

402
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:39,770
we want to play pro is going to uh...
overrated proceeding three bytes

403
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,490
also of

404
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,130
no news that's

405
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,790
of these characters right here is just
eight members will tear drop

406
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,920
but we do it again

407
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,350
stash changed

408
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,890
this numbers to cheat also d_c_ has
actually changed one

409
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,910
so this is very cute characters were off

410
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,050
uh... by that

411
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,040
so the goal to stabilize with the
techniques for stabilizer apple so

412
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,890
doesn't change even when you

413
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,730
issue

414
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,150
all of the opulent

415
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,170
so this'll set

416
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,960
danger

417
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,390
anything that uh... doesn't have a real

418
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,390
geritol as your about

419
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,840
so at this point because it'll set this
in the opera will be fixed that

420
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,140
this case here

421
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,090
should be uh...

422
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,350
twenty-four which should be thirty six

423
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,100
their twenty four thirty six

424
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:38,490
so that's the the most of all pros

425
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,310
on one of

426
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,070
edamame

427
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,880
format string ball abilities to be used
to

428
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,309
in these calls na service conditions

429
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,639
anytime you try to read or write in
every location that is

430
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:58,110
motley fool

431
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,440
to either can't right

432
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,960
that's our report location or doesn't
exist in memories

433
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,100
the persian depression in this exam

434
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:13,100
but you know as we have an access
violation ready to get beat

435
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,310
program crashed

436
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,990
cdfreaks evil

437
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:27,220
so limitations

438
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,990
into one doesn't barnett base addresses
changed at the show different dot

439
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,050
restarted based address of saks fifth
week of change

440
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,290
so if you need to be writing address to
the set

441
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,470
accompanied here

442
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,590
even though that's that may change

443
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,070
the but the key thing before ministry
for police

444
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,810
is that usually some kind of rights
function and output functions and a lot

445
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,380
of times you can't get that out

446
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,550
function back to you

447
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,920
setting it up for that

448
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,410
you can figure out what the

449
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,690
these addresses

450
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:05,390
prior carried out

451
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,629
also

452
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:09,000
anything with multidex

453
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,680
inherent problem

454
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,480
stacks every woman every sort of a zero
zero carried out tax this way

455
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,790
using just format should be easy

456
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,510
accion but

457
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,289
to carry out the attacks

458
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:25,240
this kind of artwork and always interest
in history

459
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,110
now you can give us a lot of cases per
matically

460
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,920
and if you hear us these problems

461
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,560
but at stake

462
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,940
complexity to the situation

463
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,750
with the right s

464
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,370
what i mean there is

465
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,470
that person

466
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:51,960
so with the program he may be

467
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,320
how high gal

468
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,880
also answered

469
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,890
as we put that ought eight

470
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,409
in their pat you can make that number

471
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:00,680
all i'll be here

472
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,580
in writing bigger number i've read in
situations where the buffalo in a while

473
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,050
had to go up to let's say five four to
thirty six

474
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,070
so if you want to write for buying
address you and you get out and address

475
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,080
restoring the seven seven

476
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,899
he got a call for buddies

477
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:18,920
that's actually upwards over two billion

478
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,250
so the past two billion characters and
she's on welfare is reasonably

479
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,990
impossible

480
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,850
it's sold by the time

481
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,590
one of the explicitly we had taught i
was able to write the entire worldwide

482
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,840
expressed in a single person

483
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,090
the problem is mexican all off

484
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,510
the machine

485
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,470
harnesses you're set

486
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,980
distraction rate

487
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:48,100
over two million characters are put to a
pop-up window

488
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,040
moral and ethical issues in the and you
know if you would try and uh...

489
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,910
total tax

490
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,160
expense on twenty twenty seven minutes
might be

491
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,860
but may be possible

492
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,320
also as i should

493
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,230
you can only wait for whites with this

494
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,559
if you write a single white

495
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,690
cd three fights

496
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:13,169
would be overridden verbiage

497
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:15,760
so what technique to use to get around

498
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,320
village in the fact that we cannot right

499
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,380
at one time

500
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,270
what we do in four separate stages

501
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,390
we write each fights effort

502
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,780
you're interested

503
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,400
pop between each one of the rights

504
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,650
into a legal right

505
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,720
our four boys and get our address

506
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,840
so it's easier for you here

507
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,910
this may be the first what is the same
riskier

508
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,460
we determined person enough with the

509
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,240
about

510
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,770
america how u

511
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,140
before the axe

512
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,250
and then write out and we have ended up
in between

513
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,260
between two rights

514
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,029
but uh... the is lower than that uh...
since he cannot be deccan

515
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:57,730
calling the internet

516
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,890
so that when we got to be committed up
asap f

517
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,539
so even though it writing one

518
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:05,920
f_t_

519
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,050
those who have been so let's try
reversed by the words what you're saying

520
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,820
why you remembered

521
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,770
uh... so don't even want to set up which
is lower than at the end of the right of

522
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,860
over two seven s

523
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,710
well the city

524
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,570
we can actually

525
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,610
four four whites

526
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,890
and address that exam

527
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,430
will be all right and in return address
on sat

528
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,110
we can do

529
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,750
enforcing status

530
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,200
were actually going to

531
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,080
process right here so you understand
that russian

532
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,720
island and they would take everything we
talked about so far

533
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,559
proof of concept

534
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,800
attack against that up

535
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:53,800
synonym arts

536
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:13,470
go ahead and use our our demo program

537
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,740
we also to bring up

538
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,590
cheat sheet

539
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,900
and she she didn't know it certainly

540
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,250
at the f_a_a_

541
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,540
exceed remembered

542
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,780
yet portlet cheat my my beloved

543
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,210
we have a bust

544
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,320
have already converted everything in a
certain degree block area

545
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,570
so that we can actually

546
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,440
always young defiance action

547
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,800
memory retrieval like pressure program

548
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,270
milagro

549
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,230
still to come up with you understand

550
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,839
and we have seven f f_d_a_ f_a_s_

551
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,870
s europe that s here

552
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,090
two years the memory area

553
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:09,040
we're gonna bring

554
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,450
so the first thing want to do is get all
of our individual addresses

555
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:19,220
this is the first address

556
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,360
put the a_z_t_ points a week at the
legion

557
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,130
control over

558
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,190
ted only addresses right against each
other

559
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,460
whatever we put in

560
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:38,460
across all at

561
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:46,050
yes what do you base alistair

562
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:53,090
whatever choice you

563
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,889
twenty spaces in their sweet initially
texas

564
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:08,309
of and you can see

565
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:09,500
senator russ

566
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,230
percent address

567
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,490
third address before bed rest

568
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,190
so everything's looking at here

569
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:23,190
person one

570
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,510
at up

571
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,730
these addresses here is remember their
possible changing on us

572
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:35,730
make sure they're fixed candidates for

573
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,910
and changer

574
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:50,910
taxes over again

575
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,720
we have marketplace

576
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,610
four address

577
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,740
alright correctly

578
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,640
four actresses

579
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,150
did you notice every one of the come in
and out by eight

580
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:17,860
crispy

581
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,810
numerically

582
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:23,610
for the next step is

583
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,290
we need water etc

584
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,370
is purely me

585
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,930
smart rocket science

586
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,950
what you do your program run correctly

587
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,030
that's that is

588
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,550
mario andretti

589
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:46,020
kortunov milwaukee's

590
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,580
enough practices

591
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,529
forty times

592
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:53,649
every topic

593
00:32:53,649 --> 00:33:00,380
going on all

594
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:07,380
it is and where

595
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,010
first here if we were right it is

596
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,190
sarah

597
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,559
so the best way to do that is

598
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,580
seven hours

599
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,740
three-c_

600
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,560
recent rash of recent from

601
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,929
and then we would go ahead and add eight

602
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:32,640
reason why the addy

603
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,650
yes because remember we get etc

604
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,070
quite smoothly

605
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,230
so we need it

606
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,870
stating that i mean react

607
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,350
and convert decibel which is seventy
five

608
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,710
looking for a number of

609
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,570
carried here we go to the last

610
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,750
activities

611
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,790
added x

612
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,000
the change of seventy-five euro

613
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,160
we come up here should say seven path

614
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,460
would fall asleep for

615
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:08,179
moral issue

616
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,099
policy

617
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,199
and we're going to a couple days

618
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,499
so i'll

619
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:17,399
numbers eighty seven

620
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:23,179
and subtract eighty seven

621
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:28,659
one at a time

622
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,159
julie one point seven

623
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,859
so we go to the next writing

624
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:37,589
as we might hear rather than accept

625
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:42,409
dot com twenty six

626
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:49,409
among here

627
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,969
athletes there get and we can dishing
out

628
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:04,969
i think the next

629
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:15,989
contributed

630
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:26,449
or addresses as we expected

631
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:30,189
nazi forces right now

632
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:32,959
for example notices of the numbers game

633
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,119
as you can see

634
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,389
just a matter of figured i would want to
do

635
00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:41,289
calculate how things reaction you expect
to happen

636
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,069
often carried out

637
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:45,329
that's what we're gonna

638
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:46,999
didn't appear to be honest

639
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:53,999
so reports

640
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:01,130
switch here

641
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:08,130
and see if we can do this electoral
votes

642
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:15,129
sizzling is the time

643
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:17,819
introduced regime of the things you
wanted to

644
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:18,719
accident

645
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,939
last night carrying out these

646
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:23,409
repeatedly

647
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:26,119
pulaski data

648
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,449
but actually

649
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:30,390
missions there's usually can't use our
mission there

650
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,220
zero zero

651
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,120
org o_ r_

652
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,609
kicking ass that left

653
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,439
what's your reading

654
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:38,309
indian nations who will be

655
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:45,109

impairment doesn't

659
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:53,619
so the base address on this program

660
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:55,499
as always change

661
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:57,139
last night

662
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:02,469
to the demo he came up as a base
addresses

663
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:04,109
is clearly explain

664
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:05,379
siri

665
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:08,399
so we have time to something like that
happens

00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:15,399
mister hinson dot com

local delta on what

685
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,330
in this this this year

686
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,040
offers

687
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,670
explicitly i'm going to use

688
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,289
mystery witnesses

insulated to conserve admittedly have
absolutely no way salter was in this box

692
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,289
bought an attacker to use it

693
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:48,919
in control of boxes

694
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:51,399
inherited

695

of a precious

696
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,239
about a year ago

697
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:56,120
but i mean we stand off

698
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,429
money ash

699
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:00,419
combating information prior to

700
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:02,680
any fixed it

701
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,299
they went back and read passion

702
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:11,089
names

703
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:13,269
so businesses

704
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,219
bc v six

705
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,160
and remove the mask the semantic

706
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,919
jellies office

707
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,349
you what's going on

708
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,249
so in general protection

709
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:24,629
liberties

710
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,799
detected tried to shut it down

711
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,180
in a brought over there

712
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,140
throw up a boxing noticed uh... we
didn't get the person s is we actually

713
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,479
got formatter layoffs at seriously won't

714
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:38,270
this whole building would become

715
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,329
is fairly

716
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:43,229
complex in income routine

717
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:50,229
we had to have to remember

718
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:54,169
three thousand whites on saturday for
the

719
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:55,139
what are awful

720
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:56,339
could go hard

721
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:59,419
twenty-three worked

722
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:04,479
so we actually came up with some new
techniques for retail often

723
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,839
these i think the

724
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,689
anderson representing were lost

725
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:12,139
rehab that it is you can see that talk
about that

726
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:13,419
so the person you want

727
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:20,419
means happiness

728
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:25,629
person one

729
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:31,609
when i started a singles were did you
mean to make sure we executed

730
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:38,609
subsidy

731
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,849
sort of person who would do his duty dot

732
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:44,519
basis is that

733
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,459
and hopefully those

734
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:53,459
surveys

735
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:00,789
unprocessed

736
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:02,619
many uh... once your order

737
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:05,050
these were kids this is a basic syrup

738
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:10,809
were at the

739
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:13,730
like homework ahead

740
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:19,399
zero four f beginner

741
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:23,419
and we do in terms of use all this in
comparative

742
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:28,309
some formatting

743
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:32,429
reportedly exploited and we come back

744
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:33,609
what we discussed

745
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:35,519
also i should

746
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,699
mineral pieces

747
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:44,699
uh... next week

748
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:06,619
for we saved

749
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,440
i find that out nominees

750
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,219
mesa address or etc

751
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:21,039
this is the first at

752
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:28,039
the second half

753
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,109
so it's all there

754
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:40,279
what we should do this

755
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:44,239
stalwarts

756
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:51,239
his withdrawal unit personal

757
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:58,039
this is what

758
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:01,399
revealed paul martin

759
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:02,319
execution

760
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,119
system-level

761
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:06,529
people's interest

762
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:10,380
they should have put together last year

763
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,959
yeah

764
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,189
of the war

765
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:16,510
location last year we could meet with
this

766
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,709
you're going to use

767
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:22,219
sufficiently resistance and series are

768
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:25,749
the one thing about stinky parts you can
also

769
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:28,190
have all these politicians happy

770
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,309
denounced

771
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:31,799
system which do that

772
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:33,969
socal uses tactic

773
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:36,039
where we can actually up

774
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:40,869
go onto the cynicism console seriously
super review those

775
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:44,089
e targeting the correlation

776
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:45,479
let's party

777
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:48,229
make a quick configuration change this
issue

778
00:43:48,229 --> 00:43:49,410
listen to you all

779
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,880
and modeler user

780
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,049
and we seem to be arsenio

781
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,579
the medal of honor

782
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:58,589
shows that shows all boxy

783
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:00,079
clientele user

784
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,640
which really the code

785
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,779
send us your they sent us

786
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:05,729
we turn around soon

787
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:11,439
co dot there is another email in eighty
eight upholstered execution remarks he

788
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:18,249
just use this in a system consul

789
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:21,869
complexes we found out that

790
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:24,459
or process

791
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:25,819
wasn't ready

792
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:27,959
repressed integrity

793
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:30,329
c_n_n_ calculated basis

794
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:33,479
rotation

795
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:35,619
carrier jupiter

796
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,509
so complex

797
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:41,159
so let's go ahead and we'll discuss

798
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:46,289
cda

799
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:50,260
personally with the securities and come
out here soon

800
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,879
long distance calling readier

801
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:55,069
there is still ok

802
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:57,839
this year is cecil

803
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,680
piece of the silicone

804
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,269
uh... that was actually just converted
ascii

805
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,450
and all of those in the city

806
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,969
creative process

807
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,869
standard preprocessing and obviously
nothing

808
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:10,579
really complex about it

809
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:14,269
and then we have parked for addresses

810
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:16,370
the first press the san andreas

811
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,529
servidores before bed rest

812
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:25,529
and what we were actually going to be
sport addresses

813
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:30,609
action return address

814
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:36,269
narcotic was actually psychology was
actually sitting on the staff

815
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:37,269
and income

816
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:38,459
very complex

817
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:40,889
reduce that it's a question just

818
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:44,029
so we can go into the code and she is
the basic interest

819
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:48,269
but it could work something to inform
stare invasions

820
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:50,749
instantly on their calculations

821
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,479
involves change

822
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:55,349
almost remind your child care

823
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:57,240
so what you do is stop

824
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,619
we did here

825
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:02,529
let me use a trampoline on the

826
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:06,490
so in this case you are traveling all
industry cpc

827
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:08,159
one that the other

828
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:09,330
uh... and what we do

829
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,749
job location

830
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:14,299
so what are you doing this

831
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:19,639
it usually execution on the suspicion
and in respect of pop first

832
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:23,150
address all tops that second hand rests
on top staff

833
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,189
and are interested in saving

834
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:28,179
gives us a return address field
application

835
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:30,079
all that third interest and a half

836
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,349
went to work

837
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:34,949
so his sleeves that pop opera charter

838
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:36,769
but that's not trampling all

839
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:38,679
ccr to use that one

840
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:41,749
and jump straight back to cuba

841
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:43,369
the current

842
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:45,649
her back in

843
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:47,559
uh... executing ca

844
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:52,949
i know it may sound somewhat complex
everyone but

845
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:53,759
diminishes

846
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:55,229
incidental

847
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,650
uh... if i could figures

848
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,459
about anybody can figure this out and
sort of fun

849
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:03,039
wondered what papers out there was

850
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:04,120
and i said it

851
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,709
what i'm really knows what for store

852
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:13,709
viruses

853
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:18,789
this is my work

854
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:22,129
techniques for discovery

855
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:23,149
filing for these

856
00:47:23,149 --> 00:47:26,509
would be a big technically you're not
talking about it

857
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:29,919
well i don't normally use all-stars

858
00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:32,289
that they had found out

859
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:34,979
and hope that i had done

860
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:38,219
carnegie mellon research that doesn't
serve stuff

861
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,429
contact me on although he's

862
00:47:40,429 --> 00:47:43,529
as they try to recreate it with his
father

863
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:45,839
and this guy i mean days he says

864
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,159
policy is that

865
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:50,559
in the area where had his mobility
discover

866
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,059
reason why co-discovered is

867
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:57,129
terrible fathers curiosity cooperation

868
00:47:57,129 --> 00:47:59,390
spending program tabindex dash

869
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,519
input data

870
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:02,039
thickness x

871
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:06,249
so-called fund for western vocally where
he'd input data

872
00:48:06,249 --> 00:48:09,179
go to another location triggers off

873
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,309
which calls that i read that data

874
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:13,060
were a trip to canada

875
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,469
so it's a multi set

876
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:18,459
uh... and a lot of father's farm

877
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:21,559
maybe someone say that i would be better
at that

878
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:24,309
complex actions

879
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:26,290
you'll see that officers morgan

880
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:31,759
people fondness of my page by a lot of
formats

881
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:34,949
uh... by using fuzzy so i medial tests

882
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,579
i said i'm working to do my job

883
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:40,019
and every time i see

884
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:42,069
xvii

885
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:45,569
reformist reform billionaire panicked

886
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:47,889
appearances in cd mine

887
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:50,269
finally rest

888
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:53,849
screw things up a really bad

889
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:56,149
user can process

890
00:48:56,149 --> 00:48:58,769
earning the jobless processes excuse

891
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,339
occasionally

892
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:03,709
any system that he wants is the level
one server

893
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:07,239
where you see you then tell that program
where

894
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:08,630
file that process

895
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:12,189
working this is the that

896
00:49:12,189 --> 00:49:17,089
you use for restaurants and maybe some
files usefulness to specify risky

897
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:20,149
passing

898
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:23,589
so you can actually change the fall and
we have made for song

899
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:26,049
he carried out

900
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:27,859
and although easily

901
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:29,469
ultimately is

902
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:33,520
is just part of the process of
everything we for crash and burn it

903
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,179
know that

904
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:41,909
recommended somebody media and you may
need change

905
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:44,099
a bring down a little

906
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:48,919
computers

907
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:52,299
so these techniques here called when i
started doing this research project

908
00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:53,380
level was

909
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,329
modernized

910
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,170
one and seven

911
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,539
was the

912
00:49:58,539 --> 00:49:59,949
the second one

913
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:02,419
what does this make any virus

914
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:05,329
i might

915
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,789
what about all the other enterprise

916
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:09,319
any cars parked on

917
00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:13,499
so i would ask you

918
00:50:13,499 --> 00:50:18,839
program that's one line

919
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:23,119
and see a

920
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:29,139
a cross industry

921
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,479
for master google execute jonas

922
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:34,649
although it

923
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:35,910
i think the only

924
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,959
i guess i got bored of it

925
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:40,139
african faster

926
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,070
so

927
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,979
bola awaits you

928
00:50:42,979 --> 00:50:44,609
find one

929
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:48,819
i went to

930
00:50:48,819 --> 00:50:52,659
i looked at mcafee

931
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,890
but it is not at all

932
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,890
yeah

933
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,459
you have

934
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:01,519
and they want to know

935
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,259
page i don't like working

936
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:08,859
to see a product was there um...

937
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:10,150
been invited by it

938
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,379
i think i feel like

939
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:13,099
or offer or flu viruses

940
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:18,150
flex

941
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,509
cdc coalescing with mcafee

942
00:51:21,509 --> 00:51:24,929
if you can be to have you ever seen any
of

943
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:28,969
any good and wondered says the buffer
overflow protection

944
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:29,979
you know that at all

945
00:51:29,979 --> 00:51:33,119
fickle buffer overflows he put such as
if

946
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,649
some programs on

947
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:36,569
process for buffer overflows

948
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:37,690
isn't it

949
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:44,650
time now

950
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:45,899
techniques dot

951
00:51:45,899 --> 00:51:47,989
uh... if you've seen the code over here

952
00:51:47,989 --> 00:51:49,900
you notice there was a lot

953
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,359
at st

954
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:56,830
what that was actually does is things
like that

955
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,469
mentioned on this

956
00:51:58,469 --> 00:52:04,109
we had

957
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:06,309
four address

958
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:10,219
for individual address issues in person

959
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:12,259
and the biggest cooperative right

960
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:14,509
xms three bed

961
00:52:14,509 --> 00:52:17,189
base number a report addresses that

962
00:52:17,189 --> 00:52:20,379
and replace three thousand bites off
stack

963
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:21,630
so i don't do that

964
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,640
found out

965
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,539
if we consider percent ashtrays

966
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:28,899
put sold here after that i can use a
comma

967
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:31,899
as their only for one of our staff

968
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,039
whether or not

969
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:36,369
one here

970
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:38,980
so so if you have a city bread

971
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,859
beijo stacked

972
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:43,669
wouldn't be too

973
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:47,140
it would be four one four one four one
four four one has obtained

974
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,859
experts

975
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:52,779
thought might be cared for the number
eight

976
00:52:52,779 --> 00:52:53,919
said he

977
00:52:53,919 --> 00:52:59,809
we can get a sign-up day austat that
only increment up

978
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,309
so isliye

979
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:04,189
revolt crackpots ac

980
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:05,859

981
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:07,579
boxes n

982
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:11,880
beyond that we carry out its

983
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,539
masquerade

984
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:16,029
before he had unlimited office space

985
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:19,639
eliminated foot space in the barber

986
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:21,639
you know we put it in person x

987
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:25,409
read off

988
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:28,119
it's always zero seven for

989
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:30,369
we still in the past

990
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:32,229
percent x

991
00:53:32,229 --> 00:53:34,779
severe weather watches you can put

992
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:39,739
this comes in handy if you're really
reads the results that who's a person

993
00:53:39,739 --> 00:53:44,210
scheme

994
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:44,980
the fights

995
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,819
step forward towards

996
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:49,549
so the roman ruins your

997
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:54,379
this one has to be floating-point

998
00:53:54,379 --> 00:53:59,219
sarcastically zeros in the business
marketing liquidity

999
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:03,149
to this issue billing to read

1000

dadar stacked with

1001
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,389
were live independently

1002
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:09,189
slightly twice as much office at

1003
00:54:09,189 --> 00:54:11,239
read twice as much

1004
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:13,229
as i would personally

1005
00:54:13,229 --> 00:54:17,699
and find out in some ways tax refund
large sections of the second in people's

1006
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:22,509
interest

1007
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,209
sitting here detective offset

1008
00:54:25,209 --> 00:54:27,489
begins my

1009
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:32,039
mentioned buffer overflows our problem
within four months triple built

1010
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:35,190
city actually carryout buffalo

1011
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,699
using format

1012
00:54:37,699 --> 00:54:42,709
so let's say he can get it for
restaurant

1013
00:54:42,709 --> 00:54:46,779
but there's a buffer or prenatal trigger
that buffer overflow

1014
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:50,549
levers that offer or for anybody for
restaurants

1015
00:54:50,549 --> 00:54:54,089
and interesting um... wrongly that i
discovered and i'm not quite sure

1016
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:57,279
why it doesn't

1017
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,829
this right here if we

1018
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,999
don't use a comical you some character
that has to be a format since that so

1019
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:03,979
far

1020
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:04,799
as an example

1021
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,339
views per cent

1022
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:09,839
busing read the number two thousand
