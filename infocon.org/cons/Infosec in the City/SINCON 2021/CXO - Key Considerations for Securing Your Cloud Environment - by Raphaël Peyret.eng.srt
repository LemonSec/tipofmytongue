1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,399
everyone today i'm going to be talking

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,319
about key considerations for securing

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,040
your cloud environments

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
i'm raphael perry vp of product or rnd

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,000
rangi is a crest accredited cyber

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
security company that helps you protect

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,320
your cloud environments through wharton

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
an easy-to-use cloud security platform

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,799
how is securing the cloud different

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,960
through 2025

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,160
99

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
of cloud security failures

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,120
will be the customer's fault

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,680
what this means is that in the vast

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,840
majority of cloud breaches

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
the root cause is a misconfiguration

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,680
of the cloud and not a breach of the

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,399
data center or aws or azure

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,160
that means for attackers the game has

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
changed and for defenders it needs to as

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
well

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,079
attackers before the cloud would

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,079
identify valuable targets to attack and

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,800
then

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,199
invest a lot of resources

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,079
to

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,000
search for vulnerabilities to export for

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,080
that specific target

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,360
today

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,200
they've flipped that they're just

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,640
looking for any possible

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
misconfiguration out there regardless of

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,880
the company and then they look through

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,520
all of the weak targets and see who

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,759
they're going to attack

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
what that means is now

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
a misconfiguration puts a target on your

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
back right away however big or small you

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
are

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
this causes a large and increasing

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
number of security breaches that are

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,240
often

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
just down to human error one of the most

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,079
well-known ones

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,240
that you may have heard is the capital

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,350
one breach

47
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,880
[Music]

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
now the cloud is quite complex there are

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,479
more than 200 aws services

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,079
a lot of them diverse with different

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,079
security models as well

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
it's also different from what most

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
security practitioners know

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,520
from on-premise deployments

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
and it's constantly changing

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,320
deployments can now happen multiple

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,159
times an hour

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,840
where the infrastructure can change

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,319
radically

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,400
so how do you tackle this what are the

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,160
critical needs the first one is knowing

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
your cloud security posture

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
and that means understanding whether

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
there are any resources that are public

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,920
that should not be whether you have the

66
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
right logging and encryption in place

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
whether your access control is properly

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
managed

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,319
specifically for access control you need

70
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,760
to make sure that you know who has

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
access to the most sensitive resources

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,879
your crown jewels what is going to have

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
the most impact if it's lost

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
and finally

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,519
how are you detecting and investigating

76
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,519
threats to your cloud infrastructure as

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,920
i mentioned it's different that means if

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000
you're looking only at network logs you

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,519
may miss things which won't appear in

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,280
network logs for example somebody

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,160
exfiltrating all your data through an s3

82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,879
storage bucket

83
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
so when you're looking at what your

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,760
solution needs to have

85
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,640
right

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
it needs to be adapted to the maturity

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,200
of your specific organization

88
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,280
don't put the cart before the horse

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
start with basic hygiene and then level

90
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,519
up slowly from there

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,400
leverage existing processes so that you

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
can tap on what you already know in your

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
security teams

94
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,760
it needs to be automated and continuous

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,920
a quarterly pen test

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,239
will give you some insights but the

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
problem is for one whole quarter until

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,599
the next pen test you're not protected

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
and your infrastructure has changed so

100
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
many times already

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,040
systematically assess all of your cloud

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
environments and cloud service providers

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
because if you forget even one

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
development account

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
attackers will take advantage of that

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,879
now i'm going to talk very briefly about

107
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,760
harangui warden if you want to know more

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,840
please reach out we've got a free trial

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
it takes less than 10 minutes to set up

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,519
and you'll get full visibility on your

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,360
cloud environments

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,319
orton

113
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
is a cloud security platform that helps

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
you detect and fix misconfigurations in

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
one click

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,840
helps you show the path to compliance

117
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,759
and prove it to your auditors

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,238
it's extremely easy to use and designed

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,160
for security practitioners that aren't

120
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
necessarily expert in cloud security

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,040
helps you detect threats in real time

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,400
and shows you your iem security posture

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
including a deep drill down of exactly

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
who has access to what resource so that

125
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
you can answer that critical question of

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,199
who has access to my crown jewels

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
thank you very much for your time today

128
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,119
and we look forward to seeing you soon
