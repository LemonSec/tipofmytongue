our technology

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,640
we have protected them from all sorts of

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,360
different attacks

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,440
apart

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,000
one third of our employees

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
are r d specialists apart from a big

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
team that is doing antivirus

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,239
anti-malware we have a correct team of

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
440

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,400
world-class

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
researchers

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
and among them

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,799
they track 200 ultra

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,200
sophisticated cyber criminal groups

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,880
these are the statistics

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
one billion cyber threats has been

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,759
detected by kaspersky scenes inception

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,080
just last year alone

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,759
10 billion cyber attacks were stopped

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,159
by us

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,840
and every day we continue to receive 360

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,479
new

40
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,240
malicious fast

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,439
that is the sad state

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,159
and that is how chaotic is the word

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,439
today

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,680
i digress let's start

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,000
today the main story is about karna

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,320
how did it begin the beginning of a 3 am

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,000
phone call hey are you asleep

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
got to be kidding

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
the call came to our researcher

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,440
because

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
the bank saw

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
the criminals

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
siphoning core hard cash

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,238
from the atm machine

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
what actually happened

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
well

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
let's go back to 2010

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
jack barnaby did a demo

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,680
in blackhead event

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
he demonstrated that the atm can be

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,400
compromised

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
and once compromised coaching coaching

63
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,840
you can speed up the cache

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
almost like we need a jackpot in a

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,160
casino

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,319
three years later even though he didn't

67
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,959
share the source code

68
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,480
the most sophisticated copycat cape

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,599
the name

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,079
kavanagh

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,740
the first wave 2013-2015

72
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,720
[Music]

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,959
our investigation began in ukraine

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,400
one day

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
a bank employee called our researchers

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,120
insisting that we come to them

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,280
our researchers packed our bag

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
we went

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,680
in keith

80
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,239
they took us to a room and showed us

81
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,519
cccv footage

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
atms was spitting cash

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,159
at the bottom of the screen you see

84
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,599
a guy in hoodie staff

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,640
collecting the cash

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,360
one million dollar later

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
she disappeared

88
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,200
gone

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,440
initially we thought it's a true pin

90
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
malware we have seen this before

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,239
right you compromise the atm

92
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,159
you key in the code it speeds up the

93
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,280
cache

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,360
we asked what heart disease

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,360
we took it back for analysis

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,040
then

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,519
3 am another call

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,920
this time from a russian bank a big

99
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,920
russian bank in moscow there was no cctv

100
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,759
they brought us to their domain

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,440
controller now for all of you who

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,519
understand who what exactly is a domain

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
controller this is the most critical

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,600
server in your environment

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
it exactly tells you where are all your

106
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,160
your computer servers and where all your

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
pcs and laptops

108
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,880
the domain controllers is sending data

109
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,160
to an ip address in asia

110
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,320
so the researcher opened a process

111
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,600
explorer

112
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
to see what processes are running

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
they spotted a very suspicious remote

114
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,479
access to fnc

115
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
a large russian bank

116
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
an ip address in asia

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,240
and a remote access tool

118
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
and the researcher thought

119
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,400
what if

120
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
what if

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
the hacker is still active on the other

122
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
side

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,960
he opens a text

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,639
editor he typed hello

125
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,880
he waited

126
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,520
he waited

127
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
this king

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,320
obviously the banking has been

129
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
compromised

130
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,639
in 2013 to 2015 these for all the

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,720
countries that has been affected

132
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,840
this is a heat

133
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,080
map these are the countries over here

134
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,639
this is where

135
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,680
the heat heats up as well one billion

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,160
dollar has been siphoned off

137
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,560
various atms various banks

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
how did they do it

139
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,479
the modus operandi goes like this

140
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,759
it starts with a phishing email

141
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,360
to a bank employee

142
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,919
purporting to be the central bank

143
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,440
who will

144
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
not open an email from a central bank

145
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
right

146
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
the bank employee opens it

147
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
he didn't know he's attacked

148
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,319
the malware came in

149
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,800
opens up a back door allows more to come

150
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,280
in

151
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
and it most laterally within the

152
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,800
organization

153
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,520
trying to find where are the wire

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
is the goal

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,560
they hit upon the cash transfer system

156
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
that's where they strike go

157
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,919
through that

158
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,720
they can either transfer the money

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
as swiss transfer into a fake bank

160
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,319
account

161
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,120
or speed up the cash through an atm and

162
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,800
get money mail to collect it

163
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,280
on average it takes about two to four

164
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,160
months

165
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,880
to drain every victim

166
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
starting the first day from the first

167
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,199
day of infection

168
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,840
scary right

169
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
there's no stopping

170
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
fast forward

171
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
summer 2016

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,960
taiwan got hit

173
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,160
cyber criminals found a weakness in the

174
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,479
cash machine which caused it to spit all

175
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,800
of its money out and a lot in time and

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,479
place

177
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,759
was extremely sophisticated suddenly all

178
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,080
your atms are empty something has

179
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,280
happened

180
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,720
and the people

181
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
starting really this is a really big

182
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,840
you

183
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
mouth

184
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,240
the first bank reported that over 70

185
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,040
million nt dollars was withdrawn

186
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,760
illegally the withdrawals were made in

187
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,200
both taipei and taizhou across 34 atms

188
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
and 20 branches

189
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
someone reported that 60 000 nt was left

190
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,040
at an atm at first bank scooting branch

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
it's crazy

192
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,839
he didn't touch anything the money came

193
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,000
out

194
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,720
so what happened

195
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
41 atms were compromised

196
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,000
3 million were dispensed

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,600
500 local police tracking the cctv

198
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,440
running after the meals

199
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
eventually 19 money meals managed to

200
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
escape

201
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,720
however

202
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,800
they managed to apprehend

203
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
they caught three meals

204
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,800
they were all sentenced to four to five

205
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
years in prison reach

206
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,880
and together

207
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,959
they managed to retrieve 90 of the money

208
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,518
that was good

209
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
and the telecommunication data gathered

210
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
by local police in taiwan

211
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
triggered a global hunt

212
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
for the heads of the carpenter again

213
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
from taiwan to spain

214
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,399
local enforcement agencies from taiwan

215
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,720
worked very closely with europol and

216
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
they were connected

217
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,079
to they realized they were connected to

218
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,240
the incidence of atm hackings in spain

219
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,640
started in 2017

220
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,040
interpol europol spanish police

221
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,719
eventually the main suspect was caught

222
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,279
in march 2018 the spanish national

223
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,160
police arrested ukrainian citizen dennis

224
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,240
katana

225
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
he was arrested in his home

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
his computer's still on

227
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,480
that was a lucky break that allowed

228
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
local enforcement agencies to collect

229
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,760
forensic evidence

230
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
now you will think

231
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,240
that this means the end of karna

232
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
well unfortunately no

233
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
it is here to stay

234
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
in 2019

235
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
there were news

236
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
that kavanaugh is back

237
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
and guess what the source code is

238
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,680
actually uploaded

239
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,920
to openvirus.portal

240
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,839
open source

241
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,959
well done

242
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,079
now

243
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,000
there are many copycats who can get

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
their hands

245
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,079
on the software

246
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,600
in 2021 june two carbonite hikers were

247
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,760
sentenced to eight years of prison in

248
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
gaza

249
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,320
copycats

250
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,959
well the situation is come

251
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,600
kabbalah is not the only criminal groups

252
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,279
around

253
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,279
this is the advanced persistent threat

254
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,600
landscape in 2020

255
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,920
you can see

256
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,079
that there's so many targets from

257
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,720
government to financial institutions to

258
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,399
telecommunications

259
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,200
to 10 significant track actors were

260
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
lazarus

261
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,880
dev stalker and etc you can read

262
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,399
remember the correct game i told you

263
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,480
about

264
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,279
together they tracked

265
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,560
220 plus

266
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,040
criminal groups around the world these

267
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
are some of the major discoveries that

268
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,680
we have

269
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,240
over the past years

270
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,959
we will expose them

271
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,639
we share the information with law

272
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,440
enforcement agencies

273
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
and hopefully

274
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,279
we can minimize the impact

275
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,680
so how can financial organizations avoid

276
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,320
becoming prey not just for covenant

277
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,279
to any of the apt groups out there

278
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
well you have to fight technology with

279
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,480
technology

280
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,399
deploy a holistic

281
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,040
approach to cover

282
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
to predict

283
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,480
to prevent to detect and to respond

284
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,040
it is hard to arrest criminals

285
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,760
but intelligence help

286
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,360
so that you can

287
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,040
work ahead of time

288
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,320
and you can prevent attacks

289
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,959
don't forget your employees

290
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,320
your partners your suppliers

291
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
anyone that has access to your i.t or is

292
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,320
connecting to iit

293
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,440
network

294
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,920
is part of the ecosystem

295
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,199
programs such that as kaspersky

296
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,680
automated security awareness platform

297
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
helped to reinforce the skills and

298
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
conducts

299
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
simulated phishing attacks so that they

300
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,480
know

301
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,040
how to prevent

302
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,839
being part of the game

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,920
well there's a quote from albert

304
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,680
einstein to say that

305
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,199
it says intellects solve problems

306
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,240
geniuses prevent them

307
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
who you would you like to be

308
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,120
are you the intellect

309
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,440
or are you the genius

310
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
well in kaspersky

311
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,519
we prefer to be the intelligence behind

312
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,480
the geniuses

313
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,600
thank you have a good day
