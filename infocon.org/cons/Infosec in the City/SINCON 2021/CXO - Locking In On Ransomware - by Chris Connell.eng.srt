00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,199
hello and good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,440
as introduced by our host i am chris

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,200
connell and i'm the managing director

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
for asia pacific at kaspersky

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,160
i'm glad to be part of this event that

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,400
gathers the decision makers and host

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
sharing of expert insights and latest

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
technologies and services

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,640
real life and the most crucial cyber

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
security challenges and actionable

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
takeaways to benefit the safety of our

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,400
business and cyberspace in general

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
for my part i'm here to briefly discuss

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,238
with you the disease that you surely

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,880
have heard of from the no media outlets

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
up to the four corners of your

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,680
boardrooms ransomware

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,680
i consider this as a plague that has

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,840
started quite with a level of innocence

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,320
but is now evolving to be a major menace

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
in the cyber world

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,280
we cannot talk about ransomware without

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,800
remembering may 2017

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
many years before this still ongoing

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
pandemic that we find ourselves in an

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,680
unprecedented virtual epidemic had

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,800
happened

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,400
the infamous wannacry outbreak

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,640
this trojan encrypter targeted computers

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,720
running the microsoft windows operating

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,760
system by encrypting data and demanding

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
ransom payments in the bitcoin

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
cryptocurrency

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
now when it exploded it appears to be a

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,479
global epidemic such as that our

36
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,880
internal telemetry alone showed more

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
than 45 000 cases of the attack in just

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,079
one day

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,400
undoubtedly the true number is much

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
higher

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,240
plus in just the first day of the attack

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,439
we also found wannacry samples in 74

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439
countries around the world alone

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,680
in short it was a never before seen

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
cyber attack

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,360
with such a global reach and aftermath

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,240
that was what we call the ransomware 1.0

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
these ransomware attacks first began in

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
the 80s but started becoming more and

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,520
more common from 2010 onwards

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
aided primarily by the emergence of

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,840
cryptocurrencies which help cyber

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,399
criminals operate without leaving behind

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,360
a trackable money trail

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
now while it was a costly attack

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
estimated to be in the region of 8

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,760
billion u.s dollars worldwide with over

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,200
200 000 computers in 150 countries

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,319
affected it was just unfortunately the

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,080
infant stage of this type of threat

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
before we deep dive into the evolution

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,040
of ransomware 1.0 here's an interesting

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,640
fact for you

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
as early as 2016

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,519
yes a year before the infamous wannacry

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,640
outbreak

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
our experts at kaspersky have been

68
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,920
talking about targeted ransomware

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
in fact in early 2017

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
our in-house researchers and researchers

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
have discovered that more and more cyber

72
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,879
criminals are turning their attention

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,360
from attacks against private users to

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
targeted ransomware attacks against

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,360
businesses

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
now the difference from wannacry which

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
is more of a hit and miss and a spray

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,959
and pray kind of attack

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
is that these targeted attacks meant

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,959
hunting for the big and lucrative

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,040
targets and breaching their defence

82
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,840
perimeters deliberately

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,239
time these groups are primarily focused

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,280
on financial organizations worldwide but

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
as early as 2017 we've already

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,200
encountered cases where payment demands

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,959
amounted to over half a million dollars

88
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,560
this trend was triggered by the fact

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
that criminals consider target advance

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
aware attacks against banks and

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,879
financial institutions as potentially

92
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,959
more profitable than mass attacks

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,760
against private users

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,480
now fast forward to 2019

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,799
the rise of the maze ransomware

96
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,480
considered one of the most notorious

97
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
malware families threatening businesses

98
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,519
and large organizations

99
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,840
remember back in 2017

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,159
the first few targeted ransomware groups

101
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,920
are only targeting financial

102
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,640
organizations because obviously the

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,280
money's with them

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,599
maze on the other hand pioneered two

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,720
game-changing trends in this field first

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,918
between 2019 and 2020

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,160
the profile of their victims goes beyond

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,639
financial firms

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,199
mazes victimology included a major south

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
korean multinational electronic

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
conglomerate an american wire and cable

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,400
manufacturer and even a county in the

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
u.s of a

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
many other cases followed and within the

115
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
within a year maze breached at least 334

116
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,160
companies and organizations

117
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
second the maze game was one of the

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,080
first groups which started the use of

119
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
pressure tactic

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
this refers to cyber criminals

121
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,520
threatening victims that they will

122
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,000
publicly leak most sensitive data stolen

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
from their compromised systems via the

124
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,720
group's own website

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,039
this gang actually did leak their

126
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,600
victims data on their website or through

127
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,759
a tip to the media

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,840
this attack plays on companies digital

129
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,400
reputation as it threatens to divulge

130
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
data of a breached entity compromising

131
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,440
its security and its name at the same

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,759
time

133
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
as more groups further vial steps amaze

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,120
which website has been taken down since

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
we've seen the rise of ransomware 2.0

136
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
which goes beyond kidnapping a companies

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
or an organization's data

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
these groups utilize the increasingly

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
valued digital reputation to force their

140
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,360
praise to pay hefty ransom

141
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
so in short from a commodity threat

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
ransomware has become an invasive and a

143
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,919
targeted attack with increased

144
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,639
sophistication and greater financial and

145
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,520
reputational impact

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,160
bringing it home our 2020 data revealed

147
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,120
that at least 61 entities from the asia

148
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
pacific region were breached by a

149
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
targeted ransomware group in 2020

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
australia and india logged the highest

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,160
number of incidents across aipac

152
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
and victims range from manufacturing

153
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
such as light industry public service

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,919
media and technology and heavy industry

155
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,000
including mining oil shipping to name

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
just a few

157
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
now we have a we have groups that are

158
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
particularly eyeing our companies trying

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
to break into our networks possessing a

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
website or media contacts to link out

161
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,479
sensitive files

162
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,280
should we not pay the ransom

163
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
how worse can it get

164
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
at present we see the rise of ransomware

165
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
as a service or us

166
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
a trend which is not new and one that

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,440
we've mentioned way back in 2016 also

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
but it looks more real now more than

169
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,599
ever

170
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,520
i'm sure you've heard about the airline

171
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
in thailand and another airline in

172
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,599
ethiopia affected by the lock bit

173
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
ransomware just last august

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
during the same time the same gang

175
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,360
posted on their website six terabytes

176
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
worth of data of a multinational it

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,479
consulting and services company and they

178
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,960
were asking for a ransom amounting to 50

179
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
million us dollars

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
lockbeat follows the ransomware as a

181
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,000
service model providing the attackers

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
with infrastructure and malware while

183
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
receiving a share of the ransom

184
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,759
breaking into the victims network is the

185
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
contractor's responsibility and as far

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
as the ransomware's distribution across

187
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,560
the network lockmic has designed their

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,840
own interesting technology

189
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,759
this ransomware is used for highly

190
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,240
targeted attacks against enterprises and

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,639
other organizations

192
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
notable past targets include

193
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
organizations in the united states

194
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,840
china

195
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,879
india

196
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,840
indonesia ukraine and now we're seeing

197
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,759
it more and more here in our region

198
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
so what does this mean to our fret

199
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
landscape as businesses and

200
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
organizations

201
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
the tangible and visible rise of

202
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
ransomware as a service means damaging

203
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
ransomware attacks are now being

204
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,080
democratized i always get that word

205
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
wrong

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
making it accessible to everyone with

207
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
the money to target and infect our

208
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,000
networks kidnap and leak our data and

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
damage our coffers and precious

210
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
reputation

211
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,720
the rise of braz cyber criminals or even

212
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,280
our competitors can hire criminals or

213
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,479
tools to wage such attacks against us

214
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,799
but i am here not to spread fear but to

215
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,440
let everyone know that while cyber

216
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,039
criminals are working together to keep

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,360
this lucrative business of ransomware

218
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
evolving and growing

219
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,040
we the good guys can do the same too

220
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,120
we believe we can avoid falling prey on

221
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
these to these attacks and keeping our

222
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,360
users and our organization safe

223
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,480
but only by working together

224
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,640
ransomware is a lucrative criminal

225
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
business

226
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,720
to make it stop the world needs to unite

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
to disrupt the criminal's kill chain and

228
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,640
make it increasingly difficult for them

229
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
to implement and profit from their

230
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
attacks

231
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
for our part we are among the founders

232
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,519
of the no more ransom project

233
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,040
it's a place to find the latest

234
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,399
decrypters ransomware removal tools and

235
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
information on ransomware protection for

236
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,800
free and it is done in collaboration

237
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
with fellow public and private firms

238
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,399
we also extended our threat intelligence

239
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,839
sharing and capacity building

240
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,080
partnership with interpol

241
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
as we believe that cooperation is the

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,320
only way to keep our cyber safe secured

243
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,959
these collaborations plus our unique hue

244
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,880
machine technology

245
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,800
meaning machine learning

246
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
in-house big data

247
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,959
and the brains of our internal expert

248
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,600
also allowed us to detect block roll

249
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
back any changes and eliminate

250
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
ransomware threat in a system at a

251
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
hundred percent rate

252
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,040
and this is based on the latest

253
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,480
independent test done by av test

254
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
this means we are the only company which

255
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
provides total protection from

256
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,000
ransomware such as lockbeat wannacry and

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
more

258
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
but enough about us

259
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,760
let's talk about you

260
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,240
for you you have remained with me

261
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,480
i call to you to seek help from experts

262
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,600
like us

263
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,680
and the law enforcement agencies in

264
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
building your defenses

265
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,000
in responding to an unfortunate attack

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
and assessing how you can beef up your

267
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
guards against ransomware

268
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,079
and the many many more threats lurking

269
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,760
around us

270
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,399
we can bring on a safer tomorrow free of

271
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,720
ransomware and other malware

272
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,800
if we know how to effectively work

273
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
together

274
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
on that note i'd like to thank you for

275
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,560
your time today and thank you
