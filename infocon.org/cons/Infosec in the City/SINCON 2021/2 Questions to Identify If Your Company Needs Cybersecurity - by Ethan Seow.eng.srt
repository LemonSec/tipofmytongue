00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,279
hello welcome to two questions to

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,519
identify if your company needs cyber

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,679
security by the center for separate

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,799
security

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,040
this is a talk especially for singcon

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,640
2021 and i ethan

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,359
am

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
excited here to be able to share with

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,600
you a bit more about this

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,960
this talk is

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,800
very simple in terms of the goals that

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
we're trying to achieve

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,119
number one we're trying to demystify

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
cyber security for companies because

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,000
very often whenever we talk to companies

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,960
they do get back to us and they ask us

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,040
how do i know if i do need cyber

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,440
security do i actually need to hire

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
somebody do i need to actually outsource

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
it out and give it to a consultant what

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,160
are my needs in cyber security so a lot

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,879
of questions were asked and this talk

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,559
was designed to be able to answer these

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,879
questions and allow you to understand a

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,079
bit more about when and how you need

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
what level of cyber security and at what

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,720
time it is really important because the

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
more we demystify it the more people

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,799
feel empowered to understand a bit more

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
about cyber security so they know when

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
and what is the best time to be able to

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,000
do what they need in cyber security

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
number two we're trying to set the

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
grounds for the need for cyber security

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
for smes and larger corporations like

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,320
rather than just simply say yes you need

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,000
cyber security today's talk is all about

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,159
honing into when

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,759
and how what kind of cyber security you

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,320
need at different points and

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,119
once you understand these two questions

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,040
and be able to answer them properly

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
you'll be able to have a better strategy

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,159
as to

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
when and how you're gonna implement

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,520
cyber security in your company

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
number three

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
it is all about also establishing the

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,479
basic needs

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,360
for a company in terms of cyber security

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
so this are the key three goals that we

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
hope that you can actually gain at the

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
end of this session

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,759
now let me give you a bit more about

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,199
myself hi i'm ethan i'm a tedx speaker

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,920
an entrepreneur an ex-medical student

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,879
and an author so my passion has always

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,760
been towards building businesses and

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,000
helping people live better lives and

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,879
cyber security is a new love of mine

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,440
because i realize that not only is it

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,959
something that is beneficial for many

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,560
people it's something that businesses

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
need to understand and develop the

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
skills in but

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
how do we know when

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,560
and what to do especially when it's

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,640
something that seems so far away and

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,680
this is why i am doing this talk today

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,160
at centcon 2021

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
and with that i would like to share a

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,040
bit more also about center for cyber

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
security so center for civil security is

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
a singapore-based company for continuous

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,160
education training work placement and

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
partnerships in the field of cyber

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
security we're here to provide effective

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,319
training and education with supportive

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,080
environments to help companies and

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,319
individuals understand cyber security

81
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,800
holistically and when we talk about this

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,959
what does it mean to be holistically it

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
means we're not believing we're not

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
believers of hard and fast rules and

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
what is needed in terms of what's

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
politically correct what our goal is

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
today is very simple at the end of the

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
day if you understand

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
what makes you need cyber security for

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
your company we have achieved our

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
educational goals at the end of the day

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,360
center for cyber security is here to

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,280
support you to understand a bit more

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
about cyber security how to use it when

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,239
to use it as well as how to balance it

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
out with the risks of the costs that you

97
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
actually take up when you pick up cyber

98
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,280
security for your company

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,720
with that i'd like to explain a bit more

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,120
about our company i'm ethan

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
i'm the ceo of the company james is the

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,439
chief operations officer and if you want

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,519
to ever contact us he's the guy that you

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
talk to the most right we also have

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
david schiffman who's our cto he's also

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,560
the ceo of our training partner which is

107
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
things cyber right he's the guy who

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,439
created cyber arena that really works on

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,959
making sure that the people on the

110
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,040
ground are well practiced in real-world

111
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,280
scenarios when they're training within

112
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
cyber and that's why we're very excited

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
to have them as our training partner and

114
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
one of the major reasons as to why we're

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,358
trying to build this base to allow

116
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,960
people to understand more about cyber

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
security

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,720
and last but not least we have ken who

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
actually is the one who prepared this

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
slide for you he's actually the one who

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
came up with the two questions because

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
as one of the guys who is actually

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
working on the ground in cyber security

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
as well as in telecoms he interacts with

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,639
a lot of companies that actually require

126
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
cyber security or

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,840
might require cyber security but they

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
don't know if they need it when they

129
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
need it and what they need it for

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
right so which is why these two

131
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,080
questions became really fundamental in

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,759
terms of how we want to help people

133
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,800
understand this big question

134
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,479
now let me get back to things cyber and

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,000
give you a bit more about the background

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,560
of things cyber or training partner so

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
they are an internationally recognized

138
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
company that trains all around the world

139
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,440
right so canada mexico

140
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,800
switzerland

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,520
france south africa i mean it goes all

142
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
over the world and they train

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,360
also

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
john bryce which is

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
one of the top i.t colleges in their

146
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,560
home country

147
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,759
that

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,759
that they cover the whole cyber security

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,520
part for drum rise

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
now these guys are really good at the

151
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,280
training and a lot of the

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
the lessons and the important

153
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
information we gain from them is exactly

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
what we share without with people like

155
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,560
you

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,440
so

157
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
and with this i'd like to jump straight

158
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,919
into

159
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,960
does your company need cyber security

160
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
now the politically correct answer to

161
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,840
all of this is stephanie yes when we

162
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,919
talk about this cyber security in the

163
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,680
most basic form are things like parcel

164
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,639
protection at least having things that

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,720
are encrypted or those which are

166
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
classified in the right servers and

167
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,039
protected with a virtual private network

168
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,520
such that only the people with dells can

169
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,800
have access to your information by right

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
that is the ideal in which most

171
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
companies should be functioning with

172
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,080
however

173
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
we recognize that in the real world

174
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
the money and the resources and hiring a

175
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
person especially for the job is really

176
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
expensive for a business especially one

177
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
that is just starting or is still trying

178
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
to figure out what they're doing in

179
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,759
terms of business or even for a

180
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,160
medium-sized business before they even

181
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,919
really start integrating the internet

182
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,880
side of things or really understand more

183
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,720
about how the it infrastructure works

184
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
it's very hard for them to recognize

185
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
that they need cyber security which is

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
why it is really important for us to

187
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,039
discuss it today like the two questions

188
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
is meant to help you understand

189
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
if and when you need cyber security

190
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,039
so to go back to the fundamentals of

191
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,000
everything

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
what is the goal of a business

193
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
so for many people it's just making

194
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
money right but

195
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
yes it is about making money it is about

196
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,280
sustainability and making sure that you

197
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,440
have enough revenue to keep things going

198
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,680
and one of the major parts about this is

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,759
taking care of your people

200
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,680
making sure that you have sustainability

201
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,000
and you can keep surviving it services

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
clientele it does operations it it has

203
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,400
vendors to work with a business is a lot

204
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
more than just

205
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
necessarily making money but a key part

206
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,039
about this is making money being

207
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,000
profitable and very often if you were to

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,479
spend extra money in an area that you

209
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,319
don't understand or you don't see the

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,440
need of

211
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,199
it seems like it's such a waste and

212
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,599
which is why for a lot of businesses at

213
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,960
least that we've met

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,199
the interest in cyber security is a lot

215
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,759
lower than for example spending on

216
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,479
marketing spending on things that would

217
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,280
be

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
revenue generating

219
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
many people will see cyber security as a

220
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,800
call center and in some sense if if and

221
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
before you ever get a breach or an

222
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,840
attack you would think cyber security is

223
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,759
probably something that is not that

224
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,680
essential for your company and you might

225
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,360
be right for

226
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
some particular stages or some companies

227
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,160
however with those two questions we hope

228
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
that you can gain some insights into

229
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,039
this

230
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,120
so let's talk about the risks versus the

231
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,199
benefits for a lot of people and this is

232
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,479
the normal

233
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
approach that i've seen many people take

234
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
when it comes to cyber security

235
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
for them the risk very much is the money

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
that is lost the amount of money they

237
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,039
pay to the cyber security staff or the

238
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,880
outsourcing that they have done the

239
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
inconvenience of actually having cyber

240
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,760
security measures that makes it hard for

241
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
a person to access certain data

242
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
at their women fancy right they have to

243
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
use certain protocols use certain

244
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,959
procedures before they can access

245
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,080
certain data now it seems like it is a

246
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
risk because it slows things down it has

247
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,519
some issues

248
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,040
and this is when we look at the benefits

249
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
right

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,720
when times are good the benefit seems

251
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
not to be there and one of my favorite

252
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
phrases from um as one of the

253
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,040
professionals that actually we had a

254
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,160
great conversa i had a great

255
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,000
conversation with

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,920
was that you know cyber security is like

257
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,959
religion

258
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,880
when things are fine and you don't need

259
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
it and you don't think about it

260
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
it's kind of at a back burner you don't

261
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,240
really think about it you don't spend

262
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
time on it but then suddenly with

263
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
something hit you hoped and pray that

264
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
you wish you had it and you had all

265
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,560
spent your time and money on it

266
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,959
previously right so it's quite a funny

267
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,360
one because

268
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
very often precautions and security is

269
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,959
something that people don't think about

270
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,040
it's the first thing because they're

271
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,399
always going to wonder

272
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,720
is it going to happen to me

273
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
and especially when we talk about

274
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
post-covet

275
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,200
post

276
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
covet pandemic world

277
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,680
where cyber security breaches are on the

278
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,320
rise and the cost is increasing per

279
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
breach

280
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,760
it is time for us to really weigh out a

281
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
lot of these different benefits and

282
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
see whether the risk still balances it

283
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,079
out

284
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,040
so with that with that as the preference

285
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
let's talk about the two questions

286
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
before you think about

287
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
you know starting a cyber security

288
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,440
outsourcing program or even hiring a

289
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,760
cyber security person

290
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
now let's look at the first question if

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,720
all your data in your company is either

292
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,800
encrypted by ransomware

293
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
lost or deleted today

294
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
are you able to resume in operations and

295
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,040
if so how fast can you do it so when we

296
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,399
talk about this

297
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,880
might this be relatable to you

298
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,720
if it's not really relatable please just

299
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
let us know right we're in the discord

300
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
server we're in the discord channel just

301
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,320
type to us i'm gonna continue in this

302
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
video but feel free to ask more

303
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,560
questions

304
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
what is the last time that you probably

305
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,120
had a computer die on you or your phone

306
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,320
died on you

307
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,640
how fast could you recover from it so

308
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
for those of us who regularly back up

309
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
our computers maybe we were able to grab

310
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
another computer and start working right

311
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
away but if you had experienced

312
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
your hard disk failure all the

313
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
information being wiped and you didn't

314
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
have backups

315
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,079
that's terrible and imagine that you are

316
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,399
the one who actually caused it to happen

317
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,160
that makes you even more frustrated

318
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,360
right so

319
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,959
when we look at this

320
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,200
in a company if we look at this

321
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,519
objectively

322
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,600
many of us might not think about the day

323
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
where we lose the data or it being all

324
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,399
encrypted however

325
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,160
it is really important for you to start

326
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,640
asking this question today because it

327
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
gives you a good idea of why

328
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,079
and when cyber security will be

329
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,440
important to you

330
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,320
so one of our friends company actually

331
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,200
had a ransomware attack that shut down

332
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,720
basically all their servers in accounts

333
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,639
how this happened was one of the staff

334
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,399
actually clicked on the ransomware and

335
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,240
it flooded the whole system and it

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,000
locked up all the information they were

337
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
willing to even pay 300 000

338
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,360
in bitcoin to the ransomware gang to be

339
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,760
able to hopefully unlock it however

340
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
because

341
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,320
we know that

342
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
it is not necessarily

343
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,680
safe

344
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,519
when you transfer the bitcoin money that

345
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,519
they will actually necessarily unlock it

346
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
for you that you know we were actually

347
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
recommending that they don't do so but

348
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
what happens is we were actually trying

349
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
to understand what they were going

350
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,839
through

351
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,279
and what they

352
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,440
ended up doing was they actually had to

353
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
roll back for two years because that's

354
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,920
the last time they updated and backed up

355
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
their service

356
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,519
that was not affected by ransomware and

357
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,120
they had to go back two years off of

358
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,839
accounts and redo all the accounts again

359
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,360
it took them six months to recover in

360
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,440
terms of the accounts department and it

361
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,000
took them a lot of money now where they

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,639
failed in cyber security in this aspect

363
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,760
was because they actually did not think

364
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
so much about the process of hiring

365
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,639
being clear and

366
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,959
hiring properly in cyber security which

367
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
is one of the reasons why they got

368
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,959
themselves into this situation

369
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,920
now

370
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
our team actually also interfaced with a

371
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,519
number of companies that have been

372
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,440
hacked in the last six months in

373
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
singapore so these range from small to

374
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,160
medium-sized companies in singapore and

375
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
it had a detrimental effect to their

376
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,240
earnings and it caused them a lot of

377
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
money to try to back everything up back

378
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,560
up again as well as to be able to

379
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
reoperate again

380
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,839
so the lost income that they've

381
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,200
experienced together with the impact of

382
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,519
you know losing the data was something

383
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
that was significant and very often five

384
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
to six uh five to six figures for each

385
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
company each realm

386
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,199
and

387
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,880
this was a very

388
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,000
startling

389
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
thing that we've noticed that a lot of

390
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,800
companies did not put into it in place

391
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
even the most basic of cyber security

392
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
measures even when they have 300 400

393
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
stuff and that actually creates

394
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
the breeding ground for the hackers to

395
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,880
come in and happily take up money from

396
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,680
you this is why for us

397
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
it is really important that you ask this

398
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
question right

399
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
if all the company data is encrypted by

400
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,120
ransomware is lost is deleted today

401
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
can you resume operations and how fast

402
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,279
can you do so

403
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
now with this question in mind let's

404
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,160
move on to the second question

405
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,120
if your customer data or vendor data or

406
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,839
any data within your company is leaked

407
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,120
to the public

408
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
what are the likely liabilities that you

409
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,000
experience

410
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,680
when we talk about this

411
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,399
you know again we go back to the stories

412
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,920
right so

413
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,519
there is a company

414
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,320
that said look we don't need to

415
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,560
look we don't need

416
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,199
to be too secure with our data i want

417
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,560
the convenience

418
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,079
you know i don't spend more money than i

419
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,360
need to

420
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
and and what happens is that their data

421
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,519
actually got hacked

422
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,199
and their information got leaked and

423
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,600
they got sued by their vendors as well

424
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,560
as the clients because this information

425
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,839
got leaked

426
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,360
and one of the major parts about this is

427
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
that the vendors and the people actually

428
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,760
stopped working with this company

429
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,120
because

430
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
they felt unsafe

431
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,199
working with them in entirety because of

432
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
what had happened i also know of a

433
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,079
startup that right after the leak they

434
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,240
actually closed down because the league

435
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
was so bad and it was medical data that

436
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
it actually caused them to lose a lot of

437
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
their credibility within the scene and

438
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
not only that they actually could find

439
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
really badly and this the the founding

440
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,639
team decided to let go of the company as

441
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,920
a result and when you suffer such losses

442
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,079
you know it could have been preventable

443
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,440
if you actually ask these questions

444
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,920
earlier and you made some simple

445
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,759
processes that would not cost too much

446
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,360
and wouldn't spend too much money

447
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,720
neither would they spend too much time

448
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,320
or caused so much inconvenience that

449
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
could have prevented these really bad

450
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,079
things from happening which is why it is

451
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,279
really important for you to ask these

452
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
questions so you know

453
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,240
really the risks in a much more intimate

454
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,519
and a much more

455
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,399
clear objective manner

456
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
so again right if your customer data or

457
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
any of the data that you have is leaked

458
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,240
we're talking about source codes we're

459
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,560
talking about passwords

460
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,079
one of the major things was phishing

461
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,880
websites right uh we have two companies

462
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,600
that we know personally they actually

463
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,959
had that instagram hacked and during the

464
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,040
peak season of their marketing they were

465
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,000
absolutely unable to access their

466
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,839
instagram accounts and because these

467
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,920
companies depended on instagram in terms

468
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,839
of the followership in terms of their

469
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,519
viewership

470
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,839
this affected them really badly and the

471
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,000
reason why this happened was because

472
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
well shared password

473
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,480
and the password was very easy to crack

474
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
and what happened to us that somebody

475
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
actually for one of them somebody

476
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,399
actually brute force into the system and

477
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,880
the other one actually had somebody who

478
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,360
fished the website uh you had a phishing

479
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,480
website

480
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,079
and they clicked on it they gave the

481
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,240
wrong data they did not have to affect

482
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
the authentication

483
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,079
and all the information just

484
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,599
went to the hackers and they took over

485
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,640
the account

486
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
now thankfully with instagram they were

487
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,319
able to verify themselves and be able to

488
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,839
find their way back to the account

489
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,520
however the two weeks of lost time that

490
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,959
they had

491
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,240
affected their revenue quite

492
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
significantly so that's a question right

493
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
what are the liabilities that you will

494
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
experience what are the losses that you

495
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
experience this is why it's really

496
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
important for you to ask these questions

497
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,480
so truth is

498
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
these two questions

499
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,120
are what you inevitably face if cyber

500
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,840
security in your company fails

501
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,480
and the businesses might fall

502
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,840
because

503
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
of the inability to answer these two

504
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
questions and see the value and the

505
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,400
benefits of having basic cyber security

506
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
such that they can avoid these massive

507
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,280
catastrophes

508
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
so

509
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,280
cyber security is here for you so that

510
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,120
you don't have to face these two

511
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
questions if and when you're being

512
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
attacked and the reason why we say when

513
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,320
is because

514
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,039
at this day and age most if not all

515
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,880
companies will eventually get hacked

516
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
because the hackers are getting better

517
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,039
they're getting smarter there's more

518
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,120
sophisticated systems phishing emails

519
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,600
are getting worse ransomware is becoming

520
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
more and more common a lot of hospitals

521
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
in the us were actually targeted during

522
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,480
covet 19 pandemic in terms of ransomware

523
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
such that they had to pay out large

524
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,200
amounts of money

525
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,880
and this is what's happening in the

526
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
world do you want to fall victim to this

527
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,679
this is why it's important for you to

528
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,440
ask these two questions let me repeat

529
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,960
again

530
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,760
if

531
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,320
all of your company's data is encrypted

532
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,320
by ransomware it's loss is deleted today

533
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,240
are you able to resume operations and

534
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
how fast can you do so

535
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
and the second question is if your

536
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
customer data or any of your private

537
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
data within the company is leaked to the

538
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,559
public what are the liabilities that you

539
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,960
experience

540
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
so let's also talk about this after you

541
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,480
have asked these two questions

542
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
i would like to go a bit further as to

543
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,919
before you even start outsourcing or

544
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,000
hiring a cybersecurity person it is

545
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
important for you to start

546
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,840
evolving this process right after these

547
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,039
two questions

548
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,200
the next questions are do i have a clear

549
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
idea of my company's network and systems

550
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
do you know where your servers are do

551
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,200
you know what services you're using in

552
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,280
terms of your website what kind of

553
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,520
softwares are you using right where are

554
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,919
your servers who is protecting your

555
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,640
servers who is who is the one actually

556
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,799
maintaining the service do you have all

557
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,520
these questions answered

558
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
and then the next point the third point

559
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,320
is what is the most important data in my

560
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
company and how am i protecting it it

561
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
can be a firewall it can be hiring

562
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,919
somebody do so or it can be something as

563
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,919
simple as two-factor authentication on a

564
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,679
regular level right where you make sure

565
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,679
that everything is verified well one of

566
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,440
the most interesting stories i've heard

567
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,840
was actually one of the biggest

568
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,640
scams in cryptocurrency in terms of

569
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,520
hacking

570
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,919
was actually somebody sending a fake

571
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,799
email of the ceo of a cryptocurrency

572
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,799
sending it to his team and saying can

573
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,880
you transfer five million dollars worth

574
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,360
of this cryptocurrency into this wallet

575
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,520
what happened nobody verified there was

576
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,480
no double verification nobody even

577
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,159
called the ceo to double check what was

578
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,760
going on and the money was sent and

579
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,360
because cryptocurrency is immutable

580
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
meaning it cannot be changed it cannot

581
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,520
be reversed it's not like a bank

582
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
the money was gone forever

583
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,000
and this is why it is really important

584
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,080
that we are very clear about what are we

585
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,600
protecting what are the things that are

586
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,440
available to us and are we protecting

587
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,960
them

588
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
and then fourth is are my staff

589
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
aware enough of cyber security or are

590
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,480
they even trained to be so right so

591
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,799
if a person is not trained they might

592
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,440
use weak passwords they might

593
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,919
expose themselves to risks that will get

594
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,240
your server compromised

595
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,960
if they do not take the right measures

596
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,799
now it is very important for us to

597
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,640
recognize that

598
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,760
if

599
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,159
our staff is not trained or even aware

600
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,240
the risk increases a lot more especially

601
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,320
if i have very valuable data which is

602
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,840
why it is important for you to ask these

603
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,960
questions

604
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,039
and then only after you have answered

605
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,360
all of this would you be

606
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,240
able to be ready for a cyber security

607
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,720
solution because before all of that is

608
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
very hard to implement anything before

609
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
all of that it's hard to see

610
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,280
if and when you need cyber security

611
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,840
solutions or or you know whether you

612
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,120
want to hire somebody or whether you

613
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,400
want to outsource this to another

614
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
company

615
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
you asking these questions will help you

616
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,120
a lot through this process and it allows

617
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
you to actually probably do some of the

618
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,760
things before you even get an official

619
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,280
consultant in

620
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
to fit uh to to set up your cyber

621
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,200
security solutions

622
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,480
so

623
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,880
usually and this is what we

624
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,840
see

625
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,200
is that within the first year when a

626
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,480
company is still trying to find their

627
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,000
footing they're trying to find their

628
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
grounds you might not need cyber

629
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
security straight off the bed but

630
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
usually within the second year

631
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
you will start wanting to put some

632
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,120
measures in place especially as you're

633
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,799
building your clientele as you start

634
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
having more presence you might want to

635
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,480
start protecting the information that

636
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
you have which is why it's not it's

637
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
really important for you to start having

638
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
these questions answered from the second

639
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,320
year onwards

640
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,480
and after all that

641
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
when you start looking at

642
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,280
solutions here are all the different

643
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
questions you can ask

644
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
you know there's all these different

645
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
things there's a lot of different

646
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,320
checklists that we can provide for you

647
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,760
if you're interested in understanding a

648
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
bit more about how to take the next

649
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
steps if you're interested in cyber

650
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
security solutions

651
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,400
now for us

652
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,120
we don't provide this for you

653
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,039
but we at least can ask the right

654
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,480
questions to give you a checklist for

655
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,320
you to decide for yourself and empower

656
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,720
you to make sure that you are choosing

657
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
the right choices for yourself

658
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,720
and after implementation and finding out

659
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
what solutions you are looking for it is

660
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
really important for you to look at

661
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
all these different gaps that you might

662
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,120
need to cover in order for you to secure

663
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,919
your system again at the end of the day

664
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,760
we need to recognize that

665
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,960
while cyber security is a cost

666
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,280
and it seems like it's a lot

667
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
we're still trying to prevent you from

668
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,039
getting catastrophic failures in terms

669
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
of data leaks or

670
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,440
stopping stoppage of service because

671
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
you're unable to access the data that is

672
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,159
available to you

673
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,679
now that we come to

674
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,039
this point

675
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,640
