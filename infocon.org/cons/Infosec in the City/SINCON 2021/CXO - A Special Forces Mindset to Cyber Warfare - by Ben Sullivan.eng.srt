1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,080
i'll just jump straight into it uh

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,360
trusting you can see my screen my

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,560
current role is the technical director

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,319
of cyber security for the next gen group

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,520
and we are with our friends at

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,360
microfocus proud platinum sponsors to

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,280
this amazing event now this position

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,960
allows me the privilege to be here today

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,960
and uh on my day-to-day talking to

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,160
forward forward-thinking creative and

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,160
amazing people like yourselves as i

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
assist in the transformational change to

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,000
which we look at implement and assess

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
our cybersecurity postures

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,240
in organizations uh looking to secure

16
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
their digital ecosystem from the vast

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
ever changing and critically unique

18
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,320
threat landscape now i say unique

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,160
because while some of the tool sets in

20
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
organizations might be household names

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,480
the definition and the application of

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,000
them is never the same

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
now you've heard some great speakers

24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
today on a range of topics but i wanted

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,079
to take you on a bit of a different

26
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,840
journey i don't have much time with you

27
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,600
today but i want to leave you with a

28
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,520
brief background on why my history in

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,680
the special forces and the mindset that

30
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,520
i had to adopt played such a defining

31
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,719
role in how i approach cyber security

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
as you can see the beard is a little bit

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,039
grayer and the piercing stair has been

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,119
replaced with a smile uh this is me in

35
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,840
afghanistan in 2013 at the tail end of

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
an action-packed tour i spent a decade

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
serving in the australian army and the

38
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,280
lion's share of that within the special

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
forces community that are supported

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
across the globe uh in in wartime

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
peacetime enabling and training roles

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
uh within different special forces units

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,799
across the globe again

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,159
over those years i took particular

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,759
interest in the electronic counter

46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,520
measures and the systems that were

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,600
defining the electronic counter measures

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
uh to define cyber practices from both

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,240
sides of the of the war zone i was

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,759
fortunate enough to work alongside some

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
of the most amazing humans in all facets

52
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,960
and cultures in life

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,399
experiences that have changed me and my

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
outlook on life for the better now the

55
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,680
role of a modern day special forces

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
soldier much like the role of the

57
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,520
predicating special forces soldiers is

58
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
to be critically minded it is to be

59
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
adaptable and cell phone and a

60
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
self-aware soldier that understands

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
their role as a member of the team as

62
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,399
much as it does of itself as an

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,600
individual

64
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,280
the mindset that is required needs to

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
have certain metrics that will allow the

66
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
trainability to an ever-evolving threat

67
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,280
landscape extending multiple domains of

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
warfare with the best interest of the

69
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,800
mission at hand

70
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
without this and some core metrics those

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
seeking to be an enabling force to the

72
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,319
special forces community do not progress

73
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,440
through the forces journey

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,520
now some of those metrics i wanted to

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
leave you with today uh in the last few

76
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
minutes i have and if you miss out on on

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
the rest of this please join me at uh at

78
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,440
my longer speech at sing kong later in

79
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
the week where i'll be talking about the

80
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,280
mindset and some of these in a bit more

81
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,560
detail

82
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,080
now i'll talk you through uh what it

83
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,920
takes to be a special forces soldier in

84
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,680
the mindset i just mentioned and some of

85
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,360
those key learnings that take us from

86
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,599
that initial start state to the future

87
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,040
state which is constant pursuit of

88
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
excellence

89
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,560
now i'll talk about cyber security with

90
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,000
the vehicle analogy and i use the

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,239
vehicle analogy because it is ever

92
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
changing now let's i want to picture

93
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,400
yourself inside a vehicle you're looking

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,159
through the rear vision mirror and the

95
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,280
reason you're looking through the rear

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,519
vision mirror is to learn from history

97
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,360
in order to provide the best

98
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,440
state in forward looking

99
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,879
you need to have a true historical

100
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
knowledge of what cyber security is

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
and this goes back to the dates of the

102
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
early implementation of special forces

103
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
in warfare

104
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
currently in modern in modern warfare we

105
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
learn from those mistakes and it is just

106
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,440
as pertinent to learn from those

107
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,200
mistakes so we don't make the same

108
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,599
mistakes in the future

109
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,760
i mentioned trainability earlier if you

110
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
can't learn from history your

111
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
trainability isn't isn't quite up to

112
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,519
standard trainability is a key in any

113
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,040
cyber security realm whether it's you're

114
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
an analyst whether you're a leader or

115
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,959
whether you're joining in an internship

116
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,280
level trainability is critical at all

117
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
levels of cyber security to learn from

118
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
history to then bring us into the

119
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,239
vehicle where we're sitting inside in

120
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,599
the present

121
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,959
when we're inside the vehicle and we're

122
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,959
present we can see all that around us we

123
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
need to have critical awareness we need

124
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,480
to understand what our threat landscape

125
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
looks like and we need to see as the

126
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
threat landscape is changing as we're

127
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
driving through the vast differences

128
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,920
within the terrains of what the threats

129
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
are as they're coming towards

130
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
so special forces mindset needs to be

131
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
adaptive it needs to have

132
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,239
self-criticality self-criticality

133
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
it needs to have self-development

134
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,760
and these three things awareness

135
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
self-criticality and self-development

136
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,840
play a pivotal role in who you are as a

137
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
cyber security expert or a cybersecurity

138
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
leader

139
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,680
next is understanding the team this is

140
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,080
also inside the vehicle analogy what is

141
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,160
around you what does that self-awareness

142
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
look like we have a steering wheel we

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
have passengers we have people in the

144
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,360
back but it's not just the physical team

145
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
it's not just the people that are with

146
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
you day to day it's not just the people

147
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
that are third party assisting you in

148
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
your cybersecurity risk

149
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,960
posture

150
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,639
it is also the tools

151
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,240
it's also the vehicle in this instance

152
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,600
it's the engine that drives us there

153
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,440
it's a gearbox that allows us to change

154
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,400
speeds

155
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,240
it's the windows that allow us to take

156
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
down and see and allow us to get that

157
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,479
awareness piece

158
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,479
we need to understand our team not just

159
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,360
from

160
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
the people and the people around us we

161
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
need to understand that our team is also

162
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
our vendor technologies that we build

163
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
together in a cyber security fabric that

164
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,919
really provide us the capability and the

165
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,360
metrics to be able to defend our

166
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,560
organization's digital ecosystem

167
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
once we understand that and we can truly

168
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,320
adopt to what our

169
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
technologies are aware we can then

170
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,160
become truly aware of what our team is

171
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
and what our team is capable of

172
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
we need to understand team criticality

173
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
we need to understand if one thing falls

174
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
over do we have vendor in depth or

175
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,160
defense in depth and the strategies that

176
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,240
will take us from that criticality to

177
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
the point of changeover

178
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,639
do we have role crossover

179
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,720
do we understand each person in that

180
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
team's role and if that person isn't

181
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
there for that day if that person

182
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
something happens

183
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
who can take over that role we need to

184
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
have role crossover and again that

185
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,440
doesn't extend from the people in the

186
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
room that extends to your vendor

187
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
technologies we need to understand the

188
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,600
team in a holistic sense in order to

189
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
provide security and so resiliency

190
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
and lastly is the windscreen we need to

191
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,039
be forward thinking

192
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,720
in forward thinking we can achieve the

193
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,639
constant pursuit of excellence and that

194
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,240
is really the end state of a special

195
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,919
forces mindset

196
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,600
is to be on the constant pursuit of

197
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
excellence

198
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
how do we do that in this

199
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
forward-looking piece

200
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
we adopt a rehearsal of concepts

201
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
something in special forces we did every

202
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,319
single day

203
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
we provided and performed rehearsals of

204
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
concepts whether that was tabletop

205
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
exercises or whether that was physical

206
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,919
exercises on the ground

207
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
understanding every remit and every

208
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
length of our role and our vendor

209
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
technologies role to maximize that

210
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,199
technical in depth now the tech in depth

211
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,199
as i mentioned in the uh inside the

212
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,000
vehicle piece we need to really maximize

213
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
what our vendor technologies are capable

214
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,360
of in our instance i talk to

215
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,880
organizations all the time and i

216
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
guarantee you that every you know once

217
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
in three conversations the vendor

218
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,919
technologies they've got in their

219
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,199
systems

220
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,680
are there to provide a certain outcome

221
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,759
but by proxy they can allow us to do a

222
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,440
lot more so we need to understand the

223
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
breadth of capability within our vendor

224
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,000
technologies within our stack

225
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
these four creek key things are not just

226
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,919
the basis of a special forces mindset

227
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,599
but they are the pieces that cross over

228
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,960
into cybersecurity dramatically and

229
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
allow us to learn

230
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,960
allow us to grow and allow us to

231
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,039
understand where our left and rights of

232
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,960
arc are in terms of a cyber security

233
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
posture uplift

234
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,919
there's a great quote down the bottom

235
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
there we are makers of history we are

236
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
made by history we need to learn from

237
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,199
history so that we can grow in the

238
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,280
future

239
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
join me for my longer speech on friday

240
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,160
as we go through and dive further into

241
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
this special forces mindset and how it

242
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,039
adopts into a cyber security model
