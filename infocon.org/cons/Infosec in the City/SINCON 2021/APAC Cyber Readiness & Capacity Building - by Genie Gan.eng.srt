1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,799
hello everyone and thank you sincon

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,720
organizers for inviting me to speak we

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,639
appreciate our partnership with the

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,040
cincon team it's my pleasure to discuss

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,120
trends in the asia pacific region with

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,440
respect to cyber resilience and capacity

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
building efforts

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,359
but if you would indulge me i'd like to

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
start by talking about something i enjoy

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,599
very much and which i suspect you two

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,240
would enjoy which is food

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,279
i also enjoy cooking as a result of my

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,480
appreciation for good food and i relish

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,920
the process of combining more

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,239
ingredients spices condiments

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,320
to create a wholesome

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
tasty dish

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,520
and experimenting with different

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,600
combinations of spices and culinary

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
techniques and subsequent iterations

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,079
of course fortunately for me

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,800
i live in the asia pacific which is of

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,399
course well home to a diversity of

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,160
cultures and cuisines and this is no

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,079
less thanks to the eclectic mix of

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,720
spices available in the region

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
not sure if you're aware that more than

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
half of the spices in the world

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
originated from asia pacific

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,320
in fact the malabar coast in india was

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
a hub of the spice trade from southeast

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
asia to europe in the not too distant

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,479
past

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,119
unsurprisingly apec bears witness to a

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,880
variety of well-loved flavors including

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,159
the sweet gulab jamun from india

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
the spicy and

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,960
sometimes also numbing mala

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,560
from china and the umami flavored kimchi

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
from from korea

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,479
i've spoken a lot about food and in case

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,600
you're wondering what's the relevance to

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
my topic

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
well just like the unique spice mix in

45
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,280
each country i believe that the cyber

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
security landscape in no two countries

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,119
is the same

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,399
we face

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,520
similar

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,040
broad trends

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,320
from growing

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,560
digital dependency

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,720
rising cyber attacks

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
an italian gap in cyber security

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
but the double is in the details

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
so if you were to take a closer look

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,800
countries across the region vary from by

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,520
by

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,319
key threat factors

60
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,959
vulnerabilities

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,440
cyber security education levels

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
capabilities and capacities

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
take the example of ransomware

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,200
we found that a large majority of

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,959
ransomware attacks in indonesia are

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,480
targeted the palm production industry

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
and in thailand

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
hotels

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
state enterprises and beverage companies

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,599
are the worst hit

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,000
while in singapore the primary targets

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
are those in the engineering and

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
aerospace industries

74
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,519
so this naturally calls for different

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
priorities and strategies in each of

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
these countries to best protect the most

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,800
vulnerable as well as critical sectors

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
my sharing today will therefore focus on

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
cyber capacity building

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
and the reason is

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
capacity building

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
in my opinion is within our control

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,879
it is foundational

84
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,599
to cyber security

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,159
it is perhaps the most urgent area for

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,480
countries to invest in today for the

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,560
benefit of tomorrow as well

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,159
especially given

89
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,400
the long runway and forward planning

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,319
that's much required to develop capacity

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,360
that really doesn't happen overnight

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
but before i do so let's first talk

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,599
about the difference between capability

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,480
and capacity

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,439
capability is a measure of skill for

96
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,040
instance does a country have the

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
requisite talent to perform

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,599
digital forensics malware analysis

99
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,840
reverse engineering and

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,319
incident response

101
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
capacity on the other hand is a measure

102
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,439
of resources for each capabilities

103
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,120
do companies in critical sectors have

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,079
security operation centers also known as

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,160
also known as socs

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,918
and how many people in the socs are

107
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,000
equipped to protect to detect

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,680
and to respond to cybersecurity security

109
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,880
incidents

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,040
how much budget is allocated to develop

111
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,520
and to activate a company

112
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,120
emergency

113
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
response team or cert when when the need

114
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
does arise

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
so both concepts are intertwined but

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,120
there is a fine

117
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,280
distinction

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
i will talk a little bit about the state

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
of cyber security

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,680
capacity building in apac

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,400
much like how the same spices are used

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,759
in multiple ways across cuisines in

123
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,080
in asia pacific

124
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,240
countries also have unique needs and

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
challenges around developing cyber

126
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,919
capacity

127
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,759
and cyber security education and

128
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,400
capacity building

129
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
begin with a recognition of this

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
diversity

131
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,919
looking at apac

132
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,720
we can broadly categorize

133
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
the long list of countries into three

134
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,160
main groups according to the levels of

135
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
readiness to deal with cyber attacks

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,720
first of course the advanced countries

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,639
who are leaders in the cyber security

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,160
field who have clear strategies in place

139
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,680
already and are already acting on them

140
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,800
the second group will be the

141
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
intermediate countries who have

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
identified cyber attacks as an area they

143
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,120
need to to to really look into and have

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
attempted to make some inroads

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
the third group would be the initial

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
countries who have just begun paying

147
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
attention to this area

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,479
um

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,880
for various reasons it possibly

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,520
including more pressing domestic

151
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
needs or issues such as the current

152
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
pandemic that's that's been ongoing

153
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,759
that's taking their attention away from

154
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
from looking into cyber security issues

155
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
any sooner

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
so these categories are certainly not an

157
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,759
attempt to downplay the efforts or

158
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,560
efficacy of any country

159
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
in fact far from it

160
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
on the contrary it helps us to better

161
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,800
tailor solutions to meet the specific

162
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,639
needs of a country based on its current

163
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,520
level of cyber security readiness

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
we also draw from the best practices of

165
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
countries that are more advanced in the

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,199
cyber security journeys

167
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,919
one example i'll raise is singapore

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
a country that has been putting a lot of

169
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
effort into boosting its national cyber

170
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,680
security capacity

171
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,800
last year

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,880
in 2020 it launched the safer cyberspace

173
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,680
master plan with the aim to raise the

174
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,599
general level of cyber security in

175
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,639
singapore

176
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,599
and one aspect of the plan involves

177
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,000
strengthening cyber attack

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
detection and analysis capabilities on a

179
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,759
national scale including around ai and

180
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,599
iot systems

181
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,759
there also plans to support enterprises

182
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
to do so through self-help resources and

183
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
an automated software as a service

184
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,000
solution

185
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,080
moving down under

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,800
the australia cyber security strategy

187
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,520
strategy 2020 identified data security

188
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,000
as a national priority with an

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
investment of 1.67 billion australian

190
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,120
dollars allocated over

191
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,599
a period of well 10 years

192
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,120
the government's three prong strategy of

193
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,840
building a stronger digital ecosystem

194
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
growing and skilled workforce and

195
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,759
protecting australians

196
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,919
shows that they're taking cyber security

197
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,719
very seriously

198
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,960
at kaspersky a key focus is

199
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,879
to enable countries in an intermediate

200
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
category with identifying attempted

201
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,960
enrolls on certain aspects of cyber

202
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,000
security to move up to the advanced

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,240
group and of course this includes

204
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,560
identifying and talking about the gaps

205
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
in infrastructure or education

206
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
to develop a clear strategy and

207
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,840
milestone to remedy those gaps

208
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,960
both

209
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,159
india and indonesia for instance remain

210
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,279
on the cusp of releasing their

211
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,440
national cyber security strategies

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
highlighting the importance of the issue

213
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,560
particularly with the

214
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,360
recent spike in cyber attacks and

215
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,120
data leaks including a number of

216
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,519
high-profile

217
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,800
incidents

218
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
it also speaks to the challenges of

219
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,760
integrating nationwide considerations

220
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,399
and efforts into a cohesive into into

221
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,920
one cohesive plan to get stakeholders

222
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,320
buy in and manage the complications

223
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,360
arising from the pandemic

224
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,959
in parallel to releasing its strategy

225
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,720
india is making hit way in leveling up

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,120
the cyber security skills of thousands

227
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,600
of government officials and companies in

228
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
critical sectors

229
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
it's also initiated cyber security

230
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
investments and established agreements

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,040
outside asean

232
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
japan israel and bahrain for example

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
have agreed to

234
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,240
boost cooperation in capacity building

235
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
research and development and the

236
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
protection of critical information

237
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,720
infrastructure

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,320
similarly indonesia decided this year to

239
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,880
centralize the coordination of all cyber

240
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
security affairs within

241
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
the

242
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,480
national cyber and crypto agency also

243
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
known as bssn

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
and amongst others bssn is looking to

245
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
develop more

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,040
capacity building initiatives to boost

247
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,240
cyber security talent

248
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
kaspersky has been supporting several

249
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,079
governments within the asia pacific

250
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,480
region in these efforts

251
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
through our cyber capacity building

252
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,839
program

253
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,079
and against the backdrop of the pandemic

254
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
and geopolitics

255
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,920
government organizations and critical

256
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
sectors will continue to be natural

257
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
targets

258
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
for a whole array of cyber attacks be it

259
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,440
for

260
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,040
espionage for money for you know or a

261
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
political agenda

262
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,760
it is

263
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,320
therefore pivotal for countries to build

264
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,880
capacity starting with their own cyber

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,000
security strategies

266
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
i will now speak a little bit on

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,839
cooperation across countries and

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,600
industry

269
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,360
um

270
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,399
because

271
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,600
one way

272
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
um

273
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
to to build capacity

274
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
and and to to have a sound cyber

275
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
security strategy

276
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,160
is really through cooperation between

277
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,600
countries and

278
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
and the industry to facilitate knowledge

279
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
sharing and

280
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,680
capacity building

281
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,760
this matters because our economies are

282
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
highly

283
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,800
integrated

284
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,079
such that

285
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,800
or

286
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,680
or

287
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
maybe intertwined

288
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
such that a cyber attack in one location

289
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
can have

290
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,200
a regional or even global impact

291
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
on

292
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,800
on another country or another region

293
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
with interconnected

294
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
cyber chains

295
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
sorry with with interconnected supply

296
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,480
chains

297
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,040
um trade routes and information sharing

298
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,959
arrangements it is in the strategic

299
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
interest of advanced countries and

300
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
global companies to support the cyber

301
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,839
capacity development of others

302
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
in fact these conversations around cyber

303
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,600
security are already taking place

304
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,240
particularly in asean

305
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,519
for instance

306
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,399
interpol's asean cyber capacity

307
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,320
development program

308
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,959
has gathered countries across the region

309
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
to exchange information around

310
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,519
identifying and obtaining digital

311
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,800
evidence

312
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,760
they also run tabletop exercises on

313
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,200
multi-jurisdictional challenges

314
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,079
the intent really is to foster regional

315
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,240
cooperation against cybercrime by

316
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
acquainting the

317
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,000
relevant teams early on in the process

318
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
mechanisms such as the annual asean

319
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,560
japan cyber security policy meeting

320
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,560
first held in 2009 tokyo has gradually

321
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
broadened its engagement with southeast

322
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,320
asian states and these partnerships span

323
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,959
a range of areas from

324
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,200
neutral notification

325
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,639
for incidents joint industry government

326
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,380
academic collaboration

327
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,760
[Music]

328
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,920
construction of new facilities such as

329
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,639
the asean japan cyber security capacity

330
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,839
building center in thailand

331
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,880
to

332
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
u.s japan training workshops on areas

333
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,839
like industrial control

334
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,720
systems these conversations driven by

335
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,440
asian multilateral institutions are good

336
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,639
start it would also be useful to expand

337
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,959
such tie-ups to

338
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,480
the broader

339
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,519
asia-pacific region

340
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,320
but developing platforms and programs

341
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,040
alone while important is not enough the

342
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,839
real challenge is

343
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,399
facilitating

344
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,600
meaningful

345
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,079
partnership and collaboration through

346
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,800
these channels

347
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
a key ingredient

348
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
is trust

349
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,040
with different frameworks

350
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,560
around data protection and cross-border

351
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,680
exchange between countries

352
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
trust and mutual understanding are

353
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
essential in these times to find common

354
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,079
ground for the sharing of sensitive data

355
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,480
threat intelligence timely reports and

356
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
updates

357
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
confidently

358
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,519
this warrants a far deeper conversation

359
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,480
around structures to engender trust

360
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,959
across countries and organizations

361
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,680
the cyber security landscape is evolving

362
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
rapidly and so are the strategies that

363
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,079
i've shared above it is thus

364
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,760
important for policies and

365
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
responses to be agile and i believe that

366
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
one way to do so is by learning from the

367
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,320
tried and tested best practices of

368
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
advanced countries

369
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,279
and the industry

370
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
alongside close monitoring of

371
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,360
developments

372
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
for instance ransomware which has been

373
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,519
creeping into apac in recent years

374
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,399
first started spree across

375
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
europe and north america over the past

376
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,440
decade

377
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,920
there are lessons to be learned from how

378
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
countries dealt with such attacks even

379
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
as we wrap our minds around

380
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,120
the increased sophistication and

381
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,720
complexities of these threats

382
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
of course regional cooperation is but

383
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,199
one of the many ways to build cyber

384
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
capacity it would take more than a day

385
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
if i went on about the ways to increase

386
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
cyber awareness develop the cyber talent

387
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
pipeline and to engage the wider

388
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,199
community to be cyber safe

389
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,959
but i hope that the case studies i just

390
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,839
shared provide a few ideas on where to

391
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
start

392
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,399
so thank you for the opportunity to

393
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,279
speak today it's a pity i cannot take

394
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,680
you on a tour of the cyber security best

395
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,839
practices of each and every country in

396
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,320
apac or get you to taste the eclectic

397
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,959
food and spices across the region

398
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
but i do look forward to the day coming

399
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,758
soon thank you
