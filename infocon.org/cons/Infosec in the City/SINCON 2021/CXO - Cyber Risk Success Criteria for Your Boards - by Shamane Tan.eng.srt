00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,399
hi my name is charmaine tan and i'm the

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,480
chief growth officer at privacy which is

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,240
one of the top tier cyber security

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,200
consulting firms in apec i also lead the

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,440
security outreach strategy which is

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,920
aimed at helping rc executives manage

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,320
their cyber risk better as part of value

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,400
preservation and business growth

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,600
objectives

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,439
i'm also the author of cyber risk

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,279
leaders and the newest book that's

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,039
coming to town which is called the cyber

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
may day and the day after

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,599
so today in a very short couple of

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,519
minutes i'm going to try and share a

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,079
couple of key things as quickly as i can

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,399
which is called the cyber risk success

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
criteria for your board so cyber

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,680
security strategy needs to be led by the

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,800
board executed by the c-suite and owned

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
at the front lines of the organization

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,199
there's hundreds of pages out there in

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
terms of documents you know for both

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,399
directors

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,719
and from our research findings and

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,640
countless of conversations that i've had

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,719
with different work directors i find

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,559
that we don't really necessarily need

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,239
all these hundreds of pages you can just

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,400
go narrow it down to the top six success

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,640
criteria that have put them here

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,720
together for you which will aid your

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,479
board in their cyber literacy thinking

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,680
the first

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
criteria i would like to share with you

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,320
is about business ownership

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,119
so

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,880
if you think about it right

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,799
is there enough time even you know doing

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,960
bot discussions to discuss

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
about cyber risk and the chairman needs

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
to ensure that there is sufficient time

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
allocated in the board agenda you need

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
to be discussing that you need to know

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
who owns cyber risk because it is a

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
business enabler you know how are you

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
aligning your cyber risk management with

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,119
the business needs

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,920
has it been baked into major business

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,240
decisions um especially in the process

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,720
in a timely fashion take merger and

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,280
acquisition for example or partnerships

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
or new product launches

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,920
we need to approach cyber risk from an

55
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,640
enterprise-wide perspective

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,200
thus the board also have oversight of

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,399
their capability across detection and

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,758
response

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,120
if an event does occur do we have a plan

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
you know do they know what is the plan

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
you know how quickly can they recover

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,640
from it

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
second criteria is appropriate

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,879
investment right it's about investing

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,400
appropriately at the moment is their

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
current investment and security budget

67
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,239
into their defense enough

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,280
so the board needs to continuously

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,640
invest appropriately in security budget

70
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
while being mindful that there's no

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
silver bullet solution and that's very

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
important to educate them right a lot of

73
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
things can and will be resolved with

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
more investment more controls more

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,120
automation more processes but that also

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,280
still leaves us with the weak and naive

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,239
and compassionate humans which is us

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,239
so their expectations need to be managed

79
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
at the same time we need to constantly

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,400
level up in terms of awareness

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
and building that that awareness culture

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,280
as well across the whole organization

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,440
third criteria are we rightly equipped

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,080
in protecting our most valuable assets

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
not forgetting your supply chains and

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,879
also holding your suppliers to a good

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,080
standard so how does your organizational

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
design and structure

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
fare at the moment in supporting your

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,360
cyber security strategy

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
how are you incorporating cyber security

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,799
expertise

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,920
into the board governance itself right

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
so protection you know we need to know

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
if we have the right tools process and

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
people including at the bot level

97
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
are they all in place right now to

98
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,720
protect your boundaries do we have

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,959
access to the right subject matter

100
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
experts as well to be able to make

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
well-informed decisions

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,560
fourth criteria this is really a simple

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
question right if there's no adequate

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
cyber insurance do we know what is the

105
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,200
exposure to the board and if there isn't

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
cyber insurance you know does the bot

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
know what exactly what is covered

108
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,040
and perhaps you know there might be

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
other risk transfer options that you

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,879
know we need to be looking at

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,519
fifth criteria maintaining foresight so

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,160
that's important how is organization

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,720
keeping up with current affairs and who

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
will be giving top level sponsorship for

115
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,919
upcoming cyber security related

116
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,560
legislation and regulations

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
have we tied in future economic drivers

118
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,120
and digital transformation in with its

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,160
impact on cyber risk and if we have done

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,320
that you know looking into the future

121
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,199
how do we track respond and budget for

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
new threats

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
do we understand the legal ramifications

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,479
for the company

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,080
and are we championing a secure culture

126
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
and this brings me to the final criteria

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
which is industry resilience

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
collaboration is really needful for that

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
you know we can't do it alone are we

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
participating with other information

131
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
sharing organizations within the

132
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,360
ecosystem are we doing peer reviews do

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
we know how we compare at the moment

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
with companies in our industry and of

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,560
similar size

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
you have succeeded as a cso or cyber

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
risk leader you know if your bot is able

138
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,400
to tell you this that we understand the

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,120
risk in the context of our unique

140
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
business and its objectives we have

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,800
confidence that risk is being managed

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
effectively and that there is a process

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,000
that's in place to continually test

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
those assumptions

145
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
we have confidence that our security

146
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
investment is appropriate to both known

147
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,160
and anticipated risk we have a high

148
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,880
degree of confidence that we are crisis

149
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
ready

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
now those can be very bold statements

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
but is a good vision to aim for in

152
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,720
helping our board to be ready for crisis

153
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
and to be cyber resilient

154
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
so that's all i have for you today i

155
