1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,160
hi i'm mark guntrep senior director of

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,760
cyber security strategy at menlo

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,080
security i'm here today to talk to you

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,880
about a topic sassy secure access

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
service edge as a term that's really

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,039
gathered a lot of

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,320
steem and a lot of of momentum behind it

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,160
and really what it can mean to

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
organizations that are looking to make

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,039
that shift

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,920
to

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
a sassy framework and i think the first

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,920
thing that we need to look at is kind of

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,120
where this fits in the life cycle of uh

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
your digital transformation

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
so digital transformation as i'm sure

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
you all know is is a journey and it can

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,000
be a long journey but every journey

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,840
needs to have a starting point

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,680
and with for most companies that

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
starting point of digital transformation

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
was their applications taking those

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
applications that were on premise that

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,079
were in a data center and moving them up

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,920
uh to cloud platforms whether that's as

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,120
a sas application or uh something like a

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
public cloud like aws

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,320
what that meant was that uh our

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
architecture shifted so everything used

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
to be on premise everything used to be

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
in our data center my end users used to

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,200
connect in because that's all they

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,720
needed to connect to they didn't need to

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
go anywhere else

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
but when we started moving our

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,240
applications up to the cloud

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,880
it introduced one step extra

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
of now it's not in my data center i go

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,000
to to the cloud to access it um but uh

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,799
it kind of shifted the the perimeter of

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,240
what we were looking to protect from the

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,159
security side of things from being a

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,920
really defined hard

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,320
literally a wall perimeter to data my

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,479
data is now the perimeter of everything

46
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,079
i need to protect

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,759
and when you went through this process

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,759
there were probably a few questions uh

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,360
and a few things that you needed to do

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
to be successful

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,119
first was to choose your starting point

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:51,840
so

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
for many i think this was email so i'm

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,119
going to take my exchange server that's

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
sitting in my data center i'm going to

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
move that up to office 365 i'm going to

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
use this cloud thing and everything's

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
going to continue as normal

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
and so you you don't don't do this all

60
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,799
at once you do it

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,479
in a rolling

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
project plan so you need to plan what

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,800
that incremental uh

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,319
rollout is going to be which

65
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,000
applications are going to move next what

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
order are they going to go in how are

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
you going to make sure that business

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
continuity is maintained while you're

69
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,560
making that shift

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
it's everything that needs to be planned

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,120
out

72
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,959
and you probably had some applications

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
that would never go to the cloud at all

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,319
maybe something that was homegrown

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,080
something that was proprietary private

76
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,239
application that either wasn't going to

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,920
work on a cloud platform or it just

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,319
didn't make sense to move it so they

79
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,560
stayed behind in the data center and

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
that meant that for many organizations

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
the the end goal of moving their

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
applications was going to be a hybrid

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
state where some are in the cloud some

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,239
are sas some are on aws some are in my

85
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,680
data center

86
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
but that's okay that was that was my

87
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
goal that was success and that's where

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
we were heading so after we moved our

89
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,239
applications to the cloud next came the

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
network so my applications are out there

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
my data is out there

92
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,040
now i need to have a better way of

93
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,280
ensuring that my offices that my end

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
users can actually get to all of the

95
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,519
things that they need so they absolutely

96
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,519
might want to connect back into

97
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,360
hq and that data center but they also

98
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
need to go everywhere else and that's

99
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,560
where software defined networks and

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,840
sd-wan came in to really simplify

101
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,319
and smooth that process

102
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,000
so that all of those connections were

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
easier to manage you could use the

104
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,480
internet as your network coming back in

105
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,799
without any expensive private circuits

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,239
and everything else that went along with

107
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,200
that

108
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
so now

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
everybody spread around now i've got my

110
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,159
end users out there i've got my branch

111
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,319
offices connecting directly so now that

112
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,799
perimeter switch from being data out to

113
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,920
users

114
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,200
and that's all well and good for the

115
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
business but the last part that we need

116
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,760
to add to that is security and security

117
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,560
has really kind of been left behind

118
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,720
in this in this journey and i really see

119
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
it as kind of the the end of digital

120
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,879
transformation is the adoption of

121
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,519
cloud-based security or sassy

122
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,080
and when you put security in the cloud

123
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
you put it back in in the proximity of

124
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,959
your end users you put it in between the

125
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,279
people and the applications and the data

126
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,199
so you can start to get that visibility

127
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,839
again you can start to implement policy

128
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,479
you can enhance the end user

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,040
experience without sacrificing any of

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
your security posture

131
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
so it's a natural progression

132
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
and how do we get there how do we put it

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,440
in the cloud well if you listen to

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,840
gartner uh who coined the term sassy

135
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,479
again secure access service edge

136
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,479
to to define what this framework looked

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,479
like it's very much the combination or

138
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
the convergence of your network piece

139
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
and your sd-wan and all of your security

140
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,520
components all in the cloud all

141
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,160
supporting uh all of your users wherever

142
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
they happen to be

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
now this architecture there's a lot of

144
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
words on this slide right so i want to

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
use something that's a little uh maybe a

146
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,199
little less wordy um to really explain

147
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
what this means to you

148
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,080
so

149
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
similar words same outcome in terms of

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,560
this slide we still have a lot of

151
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
components in here we've got a firewall

152
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
as a service we've got a secure web

153
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
gateway we've got our cloud access

154
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,400
security broker or casbi we've got data

155
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
loss prevention zero trust network

156
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
access browser isolation there's a lot

157
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
of components in here and i see a lot of

158
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,520
the the correlate between what we did

159
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
with applications and what we do with

160
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
our security stack in terms of of how we

161
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,039
move that to the cloud

162
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,479
but i think there's one thing really

163
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,800
that we also need to to think here is

164
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
that if we look at this and we say so if

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,320
i put all of these components in the

166
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,960
cloud i have a sassy framework right

167
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,160
go well i guess maybe strictly you do

168
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,919
but if you're going to go to the effort

169
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,520
of taking each of these components

170
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
moving them up to the cloud you might

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
want to do a bit more than just having

172
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,680
six seven eight different uh

173
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
capabilities that are now cloud-based

174
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
that still don't talk to each other

175
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
still don't share information still

176
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,400
don't share policy and visibility

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
so if we're going to go through this

178
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,039
project if we're going to finish this

179
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,199
digital transformation then i think we

180
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,240
need there's a few things we need to

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
roll into it and that's centralized

182
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,160
management and centralized policy so all

183
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
of these things work together you if you

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
what how about right you set your policy

185
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,400
once

186
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,639
and everybody follows it and if it

187
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,000
follows the policy then you get this

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
centralized view into what's going on in

189
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
your network you understand who's gone

190
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,759
where what threats we're trying to come

191
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,840
in what data is where

192
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
that's when we start to see a real

193
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
benefit to moving your security to the

194
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
cloud

195
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
so how do we get there so on the

196
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
previous side right there's lots and

197
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
lots of different uh components that you

198
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,919
can move over so you might liken it to a

199
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,319
recipe i have all of my ingredients and

200
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,919
if i do them in the right order and if i

201
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,520
do them in the right amounts then at the

202
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,720
end of the day i'm going to have some

203
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
wonderful dish

204
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,319
well i'm sorry to say that's not quite

205
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,520
how it goes

206
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,039
um there is no recipe

207
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,240
for a successful sassy uh implementation

208
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
there's no steps that you can follow so

209
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
that you know that you're going to come

210
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
out at the end of the day with something

211
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
that's great

212
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
and this isn't actually something that

213
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
that's necessarily easy to do so sassy

214
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,360
isn't something that you can go out

215
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,599
there to a vendor to a service provider

216
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,639
and say just give me sassy i just wanna

217
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,560
i'll take it all let's go

218
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
so there's no one out there that has

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,319
that sku that says sassy that you buy it

220
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,080
they enable it and everything is done

221
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,919
for you it really is something that you

222
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,520
have to figure out what it is what you

223
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,639
want to do and how you want to do it

224
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,240
there's also no instructions on how to

225
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,720
do it so again this is not like a recipe

226
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
there is no step by step what do you do

227
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
because it's really up to you to define

228
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,599
what you do how you do it and what your

229
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,840
goals are

230
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
and the other important thing is that

231
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,759
success is really defined by you so

232
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,360
again this is not like a recipe where

233
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
success is the perfect

234
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,319
loaf of bread casserole burger whatever

235
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,080
it might be

236
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,759
success is defined by how you define

237
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,319
your goals uh this is not defined by

238
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,080
what you put in it's defined by where

239
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
you go and where you put that finishing

240
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
line so again very similar to what we

241
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,039
saw with applications is we're not

242
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,400
necessarily going to take all of this

243
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,599
we're not going to finish at the same

244
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,879
point with everybody everyone's going to

245
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,639
have a slightly different finishing

246
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,319
point but it's where they need to be for

247
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,440
their business so if sassy isn't like a

248
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
recipe

249
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,319
what's it like

250
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,799
well it's kinda like

251
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,240
a menu

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
and when you look at a menu a big

253
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,599
difference between a recipe and a menu

254
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
when you look at a recipe you have

255
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,279
everything that you've got to put in and

256
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,560
if you're missing an ingredient then the

257
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,920
recipe isn't going to work you're going

258
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,959
to fail

259
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,200
but when you look at a menu

260
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
i would doubt very much

261
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
that there's many people out there that

262
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,000
would go you know what i'm going to take

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
the menu and i'll take everything i want

264
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
i want all of the stuff on the menu when

265
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
you have a menu you choose what you have

266
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,120
you choose what type of meal you want

267
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
you choose how hungry you are and it's

268
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,399
kind of the same thing with sassy so as

269
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
you're looking at implementing sassy

270
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,320
first of all you choose which courses

271
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
you want to take there's nothing that

272
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,760
says you have to have

273
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,560
appetizers for the table and a soup and

274
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
an entree and a dessert and coffee and

275
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
maybe a look here at the end

276
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
that's not the rule right when you go to

277
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,920
a restaurant you choose what you want

278
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,519
maybe you just want appetizers you're

279
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,680
not that hungry maybe you want an entree

280
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
and nothing else i'm good but you get to

281
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
decide what you want and when it comes

282
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
to sassy you get to decide your starting

283
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
point where is it that you want to begin

284
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,200
this journey

285
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
and you get to decide how many of that

286
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
long list of components you actually

287
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,000
want to embed in your sassy framework

288
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
and move to the cloud what makes sense

289
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,480
for your business

290
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
secondly why it's similar to a menu you

291
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,880
get to make substitutions to your order

292
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,200
there is nothing that says what is the

293
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,040
main course is the best main course for

294
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
everybody

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
and similarly that when it comes to

296
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,120
sassy there's no

297
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,680
fits all so you can choose what you want

298
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,040
and if there are things that don't work

299
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
for you then maybe you switch them out

300
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
because every business will have

301
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,680
different goals uh different ways of

302
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,079
working and so their needs

303
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,079
their outcomes for a particular sassy

304
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,920
component could be very very different

305
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
so we need to take this into account

306
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
there isn't going to be a path that

307
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
everybody can walk down it really has to

308
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
be up to the individual for their

309
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,880
organization

310
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
and then finally it has to work for you

311
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
you can't kind of force a different view

312
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,600
on there if it's not what your business

313
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,000
needs so you need to define your goals

314
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,839
you need to define what success looks

315
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,720
like

316
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
and then you choose the pieces that

317
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,560
actually help you towards

318
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
that goal

319
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
so let's

320
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
dip into each one of these let's choose

321
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
which courses you want so where's your

322
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,720
starting point going to be uh as you

323
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
start to look at how do i how do i

324
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
build out this plan what does my journey

325
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
look like how long is it going to take

326
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
where do i start

327
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,560
i would say the the thing to consider

328
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,279
first is where is your biggest risk

329
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,839
what is it that your end users do

330
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,000
that you believe introduces uh the

331
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,839
largest risk to your organization what

332
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,800
tools where is it that this if you could

333
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,320
fix one thing that that's what it would

334
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,200
be

335
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,800
and for many organizations at least that

336
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,519
we talk to is menlo security that's the

337
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,399
web

338
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,560
the web their browser

339
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
everything they do is through the web

340
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,600
almost every single user uses the web

341
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,839
and the attackers come in with 90 of the

342
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
threats coming in through email and web

343
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
so for many of our customers that's

344
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
where they choose to start but you need

345
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,640
to

346
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
choose where your starting point is and

347
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,720
how you start that journey

348
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,920
second what does your current

349
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,839
infrastructure look like

350
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,279
similarly to when you did this for

351
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,720
applications going through digital

352
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
transformation you didn't turn

353
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,480
everything off and then a week or so

354
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
later turn everything back on again you

355
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,480
have to make sure that it works today we

356
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
can't just shut everything down my

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
employees have to keep working

358
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
we have to keep business running we have

359
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
to keep making money so we can afford

360
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
this thing right so you need to have

361
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,920
something that fits with what you're

362
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
doing today all the infrastructure you

363
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
have in today and where you want to go

364
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
moving forward which brings us to the

365
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
third point which is your organized

366
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,399
organizational roadmap

367
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,040
start with your roadmap what is it that

368
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
you want what is your business

369
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
what uh want to do what do they want to

370
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
achieve how are you going to get there

371
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,160
and then make sure you choose a vendor a

372
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
solution and a sassy journey that

373
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,920
matches that don't put it the other way

374
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
around don't have your vendor your

375
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,920
service provider define what their

376
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,519
roadmap is and you have to go along with

377
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,600
it you have to put the business first

378
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
this has to be something that's going to

379
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,160
drive business forward

380
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,399
second making substitutions to your

381
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,360
order

382
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,839
now again i said that there's no

383
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,320
one-size-fits-all right and i'll i'll

384
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
give an example that maybe your starting

385
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,720
point might uh be different to somebody

386
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
else's your need for a particular

387
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,959
component could be different to somebody

388
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
else's and so as you look at the

389
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,079
underlying architecture of uh your

390
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,440
provider

391
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,079
does it match what you need and what i

392
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,800
mean by this is are you

393
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,079
global are you only in north america are

394
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,279
you in

395
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,160
uh

396
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,480
very remote parts of the world where

397
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,959
there isn't um

398
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,120
internet capabilities there isn't high

399
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
bandwidth what are you going to do

400
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,399
do you need single visibility across

401
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
everybody in an office and remote

402
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,399
workers or are you willing to do those

403
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,399
separately so you have to make sure that

404
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,160
the capabilities and the platform that

405
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
you're buying into

406
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,199
can actually match what you need in

407
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,720
terms of scale in terms of support in

408
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,959
terms of performance

409
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,160
but also remember that different

410
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
platforms have different strengths

411
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,079
and again this kind of comes down to

412
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,600
what is it that you want to do where do

413
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,839
you want to extract the most value

414
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,600
and if you look at all those

415
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,160
capabilities within uh

416
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,720
within that sassy framework

417
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,279
i mentioned web earlier on many vendors

418
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
have a very strong secure web gateway

419
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,880
capability

420
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
others might have a very strong cosby

421
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,639
capability others might have a very

422
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,519
strong uh browser isolation capability

423
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,320
others might be dlp so you choose what

424
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
it is that where you want to start that

425
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
journey where you want to extract the

426
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
most value and that's where you start

427
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,160
the path

428
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
that's the vendor that you choose that

429
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,160
says your strengths match what i'm

430
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,680
looking for that's going to be

431
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,360
successful

432
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,199
and then finally you want to look at the

433
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,839
integrations so how choosing a platform

434
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,279
is wonderful but it's got to fit in with

435
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,199
everything else that you use whether

436
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,399
that's

437
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,880
uh a sim whether that's other internal

438
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
tools where you want to pull logs off to

439
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,959
send alerts to for your sock so you have

440
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,639
to make sure that it fits in with what

441
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,880
you have fits in with other tools that

442
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,800
you've purchased and maybe integrates

443
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,079
with other tools that you haven't yet

444
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
purchased but you know that you want to

445
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,760
so you have to plan this thing out and

446
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
make sure that it is a fit for you

447
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,360
and then finally you need to make sure

448
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
that it fits within your requirements so

449
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
again this comes down to defining what

450
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,360
are the rules that you go by what does

451
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
success look like to you uh because

452
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,600
that's how you should measure it you

453
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
shouldn't think that again comparing

454
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,959
back to the recipe that this is

455
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
something that if i follow the steps

456
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
success will come you get to choose what

457
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,480
success looks like

458
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,120
success might be i've got everything in

459
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
the cloud success might be i just have

460
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,959
my web gateway in the cloud that's the

461
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,800
only thing that makes sense for me and

462
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,480
you get to choose that

463
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
because you don't need to take

464
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,560
everything

465
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
uh ideally you would choose a platform

466
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,360
that could offer you everything that you

467
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
think you might need over the coming

468
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
years but you don't have to take it so

469
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,360
look for a platform that will enable you

470
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,519
to take what you need today but also

471
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,759
help you grow into what you're gonna

472
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
need moving forward so that you know

473
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,800
that you have that path uh you know that

474
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,199
they are gonna follow your roadmap uh to

475
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,639
success

476
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,320
and then finally you need to define your

477
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
policy uh so it's gonna go across all of

478
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,959
your

479
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,199
control points potentially depending

480
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,639
what you're taking right so it could be

481
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
web it could be applications it could be

482
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
email there's a whole lot of things in

483
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,040
here what do you want to span across all

484
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
of this how do you want that to tie

485
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,199
together that's very important in terms

486
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,600
of setting your success metrics your

487
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
security posture for your company

488
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,759
so if you walk down the path and you go

489
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
you know what i think a sassy framework

490
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,320
might be for me i think it sounds good

491
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,600
there's a lot of good things that you

492
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,000
can get out of this so the biggest one

493
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is going to be operational and business

494
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,560
efficiencies so you will be able to get

495
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,639
rid of the hardware that's in your data

496
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
center you won't have to support it you

497
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
can get rid of networking connectivity

498
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
you can get rid of having to scale

499
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
things and making sure that there's

500
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
redundancy and load balancing and all of

501
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,480
these things that you might not want to

502
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
do because if you put it up into the

503
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
cloud the vendor has to take care of

504
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
that for you it's a service you consume

505
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,599
and that's gonna

506
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,799
be good

507
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
what you're also gonna do is get

508
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
centralized control

509
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
so that cloud that's in between your end

510
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
users your applications your data the

511
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,240
web you have that point of control you

512
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,760
don't have to force everybody to come

513
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,359
back in to the office to hq and so you

514
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,799
you're giving them what they want but

515
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,280
you're regaining your control

516
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
you're getting that centralized

517
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
visibility again because of location if

518
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
everything has to go through your sassy

519
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
framework then you're gonna see

520
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,960
everything that's going on

521
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
and then finally you're gonna have that

522
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
enhanced end user experience

523
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
you're not making them connect to a vpn

524
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,760
client you're not making them do

525
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
something that makes all of the internet

526
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
slow because you're you're not being

527
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
optimized in terms of where you're going

528
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,200
you're giving your end users what they

529
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
want

530
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,640
direct access fast access scalable

531
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,039
access wherever they are to the internet

532
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,520
to their tools to their applications but

533
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,880
you're doing it in a way where you still

534
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,679
have visibility control and the business

535
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,960
is getting the benefit out to this as

536
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,799
well so it's great

537
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,440
to move to a sassy framework because of

538
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,000
all of these benefits but

539
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
while sassy will give you visibility and

540
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
control

541
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,080
what it isn't necessarily going to do is

542
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,640
enhance your security so we're here a

543
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,960
lot today around ransomware particularly

544
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,400
in the media

545
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
but phishing malware in general

546
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,039
everything is is trending upwards and as

547
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,039
i mentioned at the beginning just taking

548
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,120
the components that you might have today

549
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,960
in an appliance moving it up to the

550
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,280
cloud that isn't really going to change

551
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,000
the outcome moving an application from

552
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,679
your data center to the cloud didn't

553
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
make it a better application is still

554
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
the same application

555
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,559
so if you're looking at making this

556
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,919
shift if you're looking at making this

557
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,120
transition

558
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,360
then maybe consider doing something in a

559
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,039
different way that's actually going to

560
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,480
give you those business benefits the

561
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
operational benefits the control the

562
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
visibility

563
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,160
and enhanced security and that's where

564
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,559
zero trust and adopting a zero trust

565
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,960
mind frame uh can come in and say you

566
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,240
know what i'm gonna do things

567
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,080
differently because i want to have a

568
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
better security outcome if i'm going to

569
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,440
go through the end of my digital

570
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,360
transformation i'm going to secure

571
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
everybody all the applications all the

572
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,799
data and i'm going to do it in a better

573
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,039
way

574
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,200
what we do at menlo or the way to

575
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,160
consider xero trust so in in that stack

576
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,080
with zero trust network access and

577
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,919
that's a very important part

578
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,880
of implementing a zero trust mindset

579
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,799
so as you come through what what zero

580
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,960
trust network access is gonna do it's

581
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,799
gonna make sure who you are what what

582
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,360
device you're on your identity and then

583
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
depending who you are is going to give

584
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,440
you access to only the applications that

585
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
you're allowed access to

586
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,679
so you're limiting the scope of any user

587
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,200
coming into only the things that they

588
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
need to do

589
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,320
and that's great right so we're

590
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,919
protecting our data and application from

591
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,120
people coming in we're always going to

592
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,960
verify the end user and make sure they

593
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
are they know they're not behaving

594
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,600
strangely that they are who they say

595
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,720
they are

596
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,039
but what this singular approach to xero

597
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,679
trust doesn't do is protect the end user

598
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,360
from any of the data that's in there and

599
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
anything that might be malicious and if

600
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,440
we think of zero trust as a mindset and

601
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,799
not a uh a fixed technology

602
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,080
i think we actually need to make this

603
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
bi-directional so in the same way as i'm

604
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
not going to trust any user and i'm

605
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,080
you're gonna have to

606
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,400
earn my trust basically and my default

607
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,240
is block unless you prove otherwise and

608
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
then you get the minimum amount of

609
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
access i actually need to do the same

610
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,320
thing for every piece of data coming in

611
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,760
whether it's one of my applications

612
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
whether it's from the internet i'm not

613
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
going to trust anything coming in and

614
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
i'm going to assume everything is

615
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
malicious because if i do it that way

616
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,039
then i can protect

617
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,440
the end user from malicious data coming

618
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,200
in and i protect my data from a

619
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,520
malicious user coming in so this this

620
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,280
concept of zero trust i think is very

621
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
very important and as we look at the

622
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,200
framework i mentioned zero trust network

623
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,440
access is a line in here i believe

624
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,960
that's not enough because again that's

625
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
that singular byte uh unidirectional

626
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,039
view what we need to do is take zero

627
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,960
trust take that concept take that

628
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
mindset and apply it to everything we do

629
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,679
for all of our web gateways our cosby's

630
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,480
for dlp everything needs to have that

631
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,039
zero trust wrapper if we want to enhance

632
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,880
security and stop those threats coming

633
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,960
in

634
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
now as we look at doing this with menlo

635
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
security we actually have uh a cloud

636
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,360
security platform that is cloud native

637
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,200
uh that is designed for the cloud it's

638
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,000
designed for the modern architecture

639
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,480
that looks to do exactly that it looks

640
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
to protect your applications your data

641
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,120
from users coming in and also looks to

642
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,679
protect your users from data that's

643
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,200
coming into the organization that might

644
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
be malicious

645
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
and if we dig in a little bit on what

646
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,640
that platform looks like

647
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
everything starts with our elastic edge

648
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,280
our entire platform is global it is

649
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,000
scalable both vertically in terms of

650
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,799
workload so if you have a new region

651
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,520
that opens up if you have uh

652
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
an acquisition of a company and

653
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
thousands more users come in that's fine

654
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,760
we can take that on our platform

655
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
it's also scalable horizontally in terms

656
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,320
of security capabilities so if you start

657
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
with a web gateway then you can add on

658
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,919
different components as and when you

659
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,760
need them so we're there and we're

660
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
dynamic and elastic for whatever you

661
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
need

662
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,919
everything is encompassed by a firewall

663
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,400
as a service and the key differentiator

664
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,559
in what we do is our elastic isolation

665
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,520
core

666
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,760
everything whether it's web whether it's

667
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,919
applications data everything goes

668
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,159
through our isolation core and this is

669
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,440
the way that we implement that

670
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,919
bi-directional zero trust approach

671
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,600
because we're assuming all the data

672
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,480
coming in is malicious we're making sure

673
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,000
that we remove

674
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,679
that potential uh for infection while

675
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,840
still giving the end user the experience

676
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,360
that they expect

677
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
when they're interacting with an

678
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,799
application a website whatever it might

679
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,960
be

680
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
all of this is wrapped within a single

681
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,960
management console single paint

682
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,679
single point of of policy of management

683
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,919
of visibility and we offer a whole suite

684
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,240
of capabilities

685
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,799
everything from trust private access web

686
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,760
gateway dlp cosby we have tools for uh

687
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,080
sock analysts to help them reduce alerts

688
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,000
and investigate and resolve a little

689
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,679
quicker and then of course we have our

690
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,919
isolation capabilities uh offered

691
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,919
separately as well as our elastic

692
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,919
isolation core which impacts everything

693
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,400
that we do

694
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,440
so if you're looking at moving to

695
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,679
moving to sassy if you're looking at

696
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,840
making that that shift again to repeat

697
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,440
and kind of summarize what i went

698
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,600
through today define your plan define it

699
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,679
based on your business goals not on

700
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,480
anything else of of the recipe make it

701
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,120
your own menu uh if you're looking to

702
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
make those security enhancements then

703
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
sassy can help right it can take that

704
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
policy it can put it where it needs to

705
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,600
be to get that control and visibility

706
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
but if you're looking to improve your

707
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,279
security in terms of the threats that

708
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,919
are detected stopped and increasing your

709
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,480
security posture and proving that

710
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,600
then you might need to do something a

711
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,640
bit more

712
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
and embed

713
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,120
zero trust in as a mindset in how you

714
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
build out how you choose your vendor

715
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,600
your platform your capabilities because

716
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,679
putting zero trust in that

717
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,760
sassy deployment means that the modern

718
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
threats that are designed to get through

719
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
the traditional way of protecting an

720
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,799
organization

721
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,840
they're not going to be able to get

722
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
through they're not going to get to your

723
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,600
end users they're not going to get

724
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,840
to your devices and and infect your

725
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
network

726
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,400
so with that i will thank you for your

727
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,760
time today
