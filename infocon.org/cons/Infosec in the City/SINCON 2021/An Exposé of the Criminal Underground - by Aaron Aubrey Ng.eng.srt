aaron and i'm very pleased to be

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,519

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,120
i hope to offer you some interesting

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
insights into a very thriving criminal

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
underground that exists today without

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
further ado let's get started

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
first a quick introduction of myself i'm

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
aaron and i'm part of crowdstrike

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
intelligence i've been at a company for

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,480
almost a year now and prior to industry

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,720
i spent a decade in the military as an

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
intelligence officer i first got my

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,640
start in cyber security about five years

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,280
ago and i was assigned to build the den

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
nation cyber command in singapore also

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
known as the defence cyber organization

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,200
i then took a leave of faith right to

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
join industry about three years ago now

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,960
and before crowdstrike i was a recorded

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,039
future for two years supporting both

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,360
public and private institutions right to

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,920
develop vr track intelligence programs

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,079
in my free time i'm involved in youth

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,079
mentoring initiatives and i help with

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
the local sense community

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,640
so here are our main topics of

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,000
discussion today

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
first we will take a few moments to look

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,159
at how cyber crime or e-crime was back

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,880
like

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,479
was back in the day

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
next we will take stock of the current

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,960
state of e-crime and thereafter in the

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,479
spirit of understanding the inner

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
workings of the criminal underground we

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
will dissect the notion of everything as

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,560
a service on the criminal underground

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
and in the concluding segment i would

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
like to take the opportunity to offer

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,360
some recommendations around how you can

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,520
better defend your organization from the

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
scourge of e-crime

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,880
so first let's look at how e-crime goes

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,360
back like in the day

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,119
and this is really the center theme of

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,280
how it was like back in the day right

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
criminal actors worked very much

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,479
independently of one another

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,640
orchestrating their attacks and pursuing

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
their respective objectives alone by the

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
idea of an ecosystem was foreign

53
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,960
criminals had to be self-sufficient and

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,880
they had to develop their own end-to-end

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
tooling to support all phases of an

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,479
attack

57
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
and to give everyone a sense of how it

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
was like back in the day

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
let's spend a few moments now to talk

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
about how things were for some of these

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,120
e-crime ogs

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
let's start with one of the most

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,080
prolific and enduring e-crime adversary

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,599
carbon spider

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,200
for those among you who have been

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,599
following e-crime for a while now right

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
you may know carbon spider with a

68
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,959
different name right you may know carbon

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
spider as the cabernet group or the

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,680
cabernet gang right when carbon spider

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,720
first started out in around 2013

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
their targeting profile was

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,400
was specifically focused on points of

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
sales terminals to steal payment card

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,640
data in 2016

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,720
parts of the group split to form a new

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
group known as crowdstrike as cobalt

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,599
spider which specifically targets the

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,920
financial services industry

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
and at this point in time carbon spider

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
remained focused on stealing payment

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,000
card data their modus operandi was

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,480
straightforward steal payment cut data

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
package the information up and pedal

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
them on the cutting shops within the

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,360
criminal underground

87
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
and to give you a sense of the skill of

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
carbon spiders activity

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
at the peak of their activity carbon

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,120
spider was one of the top sellers on

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,400
joker stash

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,920
for those who have been following

93
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
e-crime for a while now right you would

94
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
know that before joker

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,360
such shut its doors in january this year

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
it was the most prolific cutting shop

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
for a good number of years and this just

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
best testament to how successful carbon

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
spider was back in the day

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,680
and next we have wizard spider who is

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,400
one of the most or probably the most

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
sophisticated e-crime adversary today

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,239
active since 2016 their members held key

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,799
roles with the den dyer group and a few

105
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,319
other criminal groups

106
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,080
wizard spiders started on their own

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,680
e-crime journey in earnest with the

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
trick-bot banking trojan and from there

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
they independently expanded on their

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
tooling but they never advertised any of

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
their tools or offered any of their

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
services on the criminal underground

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,519
wizard spider has always been very

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,200
selective with whom they choose to work

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
with and they will not collaborate with

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
just any novice criminal

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,439
in 2018

118
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,040
blizzard spiders started orchestrating

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,959
big game hunting ransomware operations

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,120
with the real ransomware

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
they were one of the tiniest in the big

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,479
game hunting space right and started

123
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
this form of targeted ransomware

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,280
operations before even before the notion

125
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,759
of big game hunting became mainstream

126
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
and in the five years that they have

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,280
been around wizard spider has developed

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
an entire repertoire of sophisticated

129
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,160
tools that enables them to independently

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
prosecute targets across the entire

131
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
keychain

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,320
and here's a glimpse of how wizard

133
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
spider came to being

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,759
the members of wizard spider first

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,759
worked together on the zeus banking

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
trojan around 2009 the person that would

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
eventually lead wizard spider was close

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
to the person who led the effort behind

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
the zeus banking trojan and because of

140
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,639
that close relationship the wizard

141
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,039
spider eventual leader was able to

142
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,199
influence the design and development of

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,880
zeus

144
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,199
subsequently the group that the wizard

145
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,919
spider eventual leader ran was known as

146
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,000
jabba zeus because the group was using

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
jabber as their primary communications

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
medium to notify them when banking

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,720
credentials were successfully stolen the

150
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
group evolved and became game over zeus

151
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,560
and game over zeus was huge success and

152
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
ripped in millions of dollars for the

153
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,199
group every month

154
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,280
the game over zeus botnet got taken down

155
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,080
in 2014 and then what happened is that

156
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
the group split with some getting

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
together to build a tool known as dry

158
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
stacks which is used by another

159
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
crowdstrike named e-craft adversary

160
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000
known as indrik spider while the others

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
moved to dyer right with the leader of

162
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,160
wizard spider starting that group and

163
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
went on to build the dire trade banking

164
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
trojan

165
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
dial was basically ran like a

166
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
professional business you know the group

167
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
rented their own office spaces had

168
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
robust and established you know

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
operations right and all this continued

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
for a while until right their office

171
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,160
spaces right were physically raided by

172
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,639
the fsb in russia this led to the dire

173
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
group closing down but this also then

174
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,280
led to the genesis of wizard spider

175
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
and last but not least we have double

176
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,080
spider who's been active since 2019 and

177
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
double spider is actually a splinter

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,919
group of indrik spider right remember

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,199
the group that we just discussed in the

180
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,160
previous slide the adversaries behind

181
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
dry stacks right so when doppel spider

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
or the group that formed double spider

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,919
left in drink spider you know they

184
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,520
actually took with them right the code

185
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,759
base of dry stacks and bit payment right

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
and created their own variants ducked as

187
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,759
doppel dry stacks and double camera

188
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,680
right with doppel dry stacks being a

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,639
loader

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,440
and double payment being in ransomware

191
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
and between the tooling right developed

192
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,199
by double spider and the predecessor

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
variants there was actually significant

194
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
code differences and doppler spiders

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,800
tooling also employed more modern

196
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
technologies

197
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
in terms of attack sequence or ttps

198
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,919
right double spider and index fighter

199
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,000
best many similarities right doppler

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
spider will typically employ doppler dry

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
stacks right to pull down the double

202
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
payment payload and double payment would

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,919
then be deployed enterprise right in the

204
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,800
victim organization

205
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
adopting a conceptual overview of how

206
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,720
doppler dry stacks carry out such an

207
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
attacks right it typically looks

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
something like this right double spider

209
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,560
first achieves initial access into the

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
target environment right and this is

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,639
typically achieved with a compromised

212
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,639
user account which is typically either

213
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,880
bought from the criminal underground or

214
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,720
double spiders stealing the credentials

215
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,800
themselves they would then install

216
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
doppler drives decks with the powershell

217
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,319
with powershot empire

218
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,160
and thereafter they would attempt to

219
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
escalate their privileges to a point

220
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,319
where they would where they get to right

221
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,080
to get to get to what they are after

222
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,759
right which is typically domain admin

223
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,199
level privileges

224
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,280
and with that doppel spider would then

225
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
install doppler drive stacks on the

226
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,280
domain controller via powershell empire

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
and then doppler drivesdex would

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,639
facilitate the estate-wide deployment of

229
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,720
double payment which is then used to

230
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,919
compel a hefty ransom payment from the

231
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,960
victim organization

232
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
so now we have seen how life as the

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,639
e-crime og was right before we delve

234
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
into the details of how e-crime is like

235
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,479
as an ecosystem today

236
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,319
let's see where we are at right at a

237
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,000
high level with e-crime today

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
let's look at an overview of the recent

239
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
intrusion activity right and over the

240
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
course of the past two years right you

241
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
can see from this graph it should be

242
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,719
evident that there has been an observed

243
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,958
400 increase in the volume of intrusion

244
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,640
activity being orchestrated by the

245
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,279
entire gamut of adversaries out there it

246
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,279
should also be apparent right that the

247
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,959
percentage of intrusion activity

248
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,480
attributed to state-sponsored

249
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,760
adversaries

250
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,320
actually remained relatively consistent

251
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
right but the activity attributed to

252
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
e-crime adversaries have surged

253
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,120
exponentially over the past two years

254
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
and of course as you probably can

255
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
surmise right e-crime attacks are a

256
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,560
major contributing factor right to the

257
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
search right in the intrusion activity

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
that has yet been attributed right to

259
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,480
date right that shows up as unassigned

260
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,279
on this particular graph

261
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
and when we think about e-crime right

262
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,959
almost immediately ransomware comes to

263
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,880
mind right and here's a breakdown of the

264
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,120
most prolific variants of ransomware in

265
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,920
use

266
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
as observed at crowdstrike intelligence

267
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
over the first half of 2021 and many of

268
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
them represented here are prolific

269
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
across asia pacific

270
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
let's speak to a few of these examples

271
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,519
first we have avadon right or riddle

272
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,120
spider the adversary behind that

273
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,519
particular ransomware right everdon was

274
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
very active before they went dormant

275
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,839
about five months ago now

276
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,399
clock right the clock ransomware or

277
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,040
graceful spider right the the adversary

278
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,800
behind the clock ransomware was

279
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,680
similarly and is similarly active right

280
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,519
they were the ones who exploited the

281
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,120
vulnerabilities affecting the file

282
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,519
transfer service a salient in january

283
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
this year and this attack hit really

284
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
close to home because one of our major

285
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,720
telcos was one of their victims

286
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
the conti ransomware right or wizard

287
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,279
spider right has a global targeting

288
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
history right as we have kind of earlier

289
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,279
alluded to right they are a mature and

290
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,600
sophisticated adversary one of the few

291
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,360
ransomware operators that possesses

292
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,959
extensive tooling right to prosecute

293
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
their attacks independently

294
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,600
the dark side ransomware right was very

295
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
active before the colonial parliament

296
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
incident right and ever since its

297
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,360
retirement right the adversary behind

298
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
the dark side ransomware otherwise known

299
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,279
as carbon spider is definitely not down

300
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,880
and now right and there's and we will

301
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,279
discuss about this in a segment that

302
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
follows shortly

303
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
double payment right or doppel spider

304
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
right just as we have discussed a few

305
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
slides ago right they have actually

306
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,200
seized recently seized operations of the

307
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
double payment ransomware but it's now

308
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
out and about with the grief ransomware

309
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
and any ransomware discussion will not

310
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,440
be complete right without the mention of

311
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
the are evil or rival ransomware right

312
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
otherwise you know known at crowdstrike

313
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
you know as pinchy spider right as the

314
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,959
adversary behind the ransomware right so

315
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,360
river or are evil went dormant shortly

316
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
after the prolific attack on jbs right

317
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
the infrastructure was back came back

318
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
online as of about last month right they

319
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,959
seem to be facing some peeling issues

320
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,040
when they first came back online but now

321
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,800
they are very much in action again

322
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,760
but really really ransomware is really

323
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,360
just the tip of the iceberg when we

324
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
think of e-crime right so now you know

325
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,000
as we go into this ecosystem right let's

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,079
get a glimpse of how e-crime adversaries

327
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,519
are known to collaborate with one

328
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,600
another these are some of the ecomm

329
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
adversaries that are known to enable big

330
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,240
game hunting ransomware operations

331
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
right lunar spider is responsible for

332
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
the development operations and sale of

333
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,519
blackboard profit spider is responsible

334
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,920
for go throat or kick and kick attack

335
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
right and mullet spider is responsible

336
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,760
for quack ball

337
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,519
and now let's look at some of the

338
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,839
prolific ransomware operators sprite

339
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
spider who is responsible for the defray

340
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,360
777 ransomware or twisted spider who's

341
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
fencer who's responsible for the maze

342
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
and egrega ransomware right noting the

343
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
fact that mace is no longer in use right

344
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,519
doppel spider who we have mentioned

345
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
multiple instance up to this point

346
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
already responsible for double payment

347
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,519
and now grief right and we have the

348
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,800
operators of the prologue ransomware

349
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
so this is how they collaborate right

350
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,040
lunar spider sells access to blockbot

351
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
right to both sprite spider and twisted

352
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,959
spider mallet spiders selling access to

353
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,040
crackbot to twisted spider doppel spider

354
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
and prolog operators right and now

355
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
equipped with the tools to support the

356
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,480
upstream attack phases these big game

357
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
hunting adversaries right would be

358
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,680
enabled to deploy the ransomware proper

359
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,320
across the victim environment

360
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
right and in the case of double spider

361
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,079
right we also observe in addition to the

362
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
ransomware right their custom download

363
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
loader is also being put down into the

364
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,839
victim environment right and this is

365
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,839
just an example of enabling additional

366
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,639
tools right to be introduced right for

367
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,920
other nefarious purposes

368
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,120
so as you have just witnessed right just

369
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,040
you know a snapshot of the economical

370
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
system right it should be clear it

371
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,760
should be it should be it should be

372
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,639
becoming clear that e-crime is in fact a

373
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,320
very prolific and thriving ecosystem

374
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,120
right

375
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,959
you know as we embark on this deep dive

376
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,480
right it's important to share some of

377
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
these key observations of this prolific

378
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,040
ecosystem right first there is

379
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,440
unprecedented cooperation between

380
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
multiple e-crime adversaries right

381
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
working together to achieve common

382
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,440
financial goals right there is also the

383
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,079
notion of comparative advantage at play

384
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,639
right a macro economic principle right

385
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,920
at playing within the criminal

386
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
underground right you see adversaries

387
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,959
pursuing specialization and developing

388
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,040
best of breed tools right the best

389
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
example right is none other than imotec

390
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,120
right or mummy spider right the

391
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,880
adversary behind the immotec right

392
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,040
loader right you know mummy spider was

393
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
squarely focused on the specialization

394
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,639
on the development of immotec and

395
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,519
focused on paddling immoted to others

396
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,160
right of course emoted is now inverted

397
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
or by extension mummy spiders now now

398
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
it's now down and out right

399
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
we have also observed e-climate

400
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,279
adversaries adopting rapid development

401
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
cycles trying to adapt to open source

402
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,199
reporting on their malware so it's

403
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,040
almost the equivalent of you know

404
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
e-crime adversaries taking to agile

405
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,959
development right you know a core tenant

406
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,880
of you know devops right to stay

407
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,959
effective right with their attacks

408
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,360
and of course ransomware as the service

409
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
has proven to be a very viable business

410
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,000
model right and with you know with

411
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,519
ransomware as a service now readily

412
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,839
available right it fundamentally lowers

413
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,000
the barrier of n3 for novice criminals

414
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
right to employ ransomware as part of

415
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519
their attacks and it also mainstreams

416
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,440
the deployment of ransomware as part of

417
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,160
e-crime attacks today

418
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,560
so overall as much as we like to think

419
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,639
that there is no honor amongst thieves

420
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,639
right we are observing this novel

421
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,959
phenomenon of cyber criminals or

422
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,279
e-current adversaries working together

423
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,360
as part of a prolific ecosystem

424
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,839
and the e-crime ecosystem can really be

425
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,160
thought of these numerous criminal

426
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,480
actors working together to achieve a

427
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,079
common goal right or to monetize some

428
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,360
kind of cyber attack right and it

429
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,920
encompasses these three main components

430
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,399
right the services component right is

431
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,399
about criminal actors offering each

432
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,480
other ways to enable that criminal

433
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,880
activity so ransomware as a service

434
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
malware as the service are just some of

435
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,079
the more common examples that fall

436
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,480
within this services component

437
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,839
distribution

438
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
distribution is about getting you know

439
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,199
facilitating right getting the

440
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,959
weaponized payloads right from the

441
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,959
adversary to their victims

442
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
right looking at adversaries that

443
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,800
specialize in offering that conduit or

444
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,000
the mechanism

445
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,199
and last but not least there is the

446
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,759
monetization component of the ecosystem

447
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,519
where you know this typically what this

448
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,360
is about is after a bridge has occurred

449
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,600
right this monetization component is

450
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,079
about facilitating the realization of

451
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,600
the financial objectives of the attack

452
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
and this is really a lay of the land you

453
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
know view of the economic system right

454
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,279
as you can see ransomware is a

455
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,000
substantive component of services but

456
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
there is you know evidently a lot of

457
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
quote-unquote other bad stuff right

458
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,800
that's being offered as a product or

459
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
service right to the highest bidder

460
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,839
and this gets us

461
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,360
to you know the heart of our

462
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,199
conversation today right understanding

463
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,519
how you know everything is available as

464
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,800
a service today on the criminal

465
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,480
underground right and we will take the

466
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,399
next statement right to take a deep dive

467
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,279
into this prolific element

468
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,560
so let's start with ransomware as a

469
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,440
service

470
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,199
right and you know when we talk about as

471
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,040
a service right one of the best examples

472
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,800
out there to speak to is the thanos

473
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,440
ransomware thanos is uh interesting in

474
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
ransomware because it basically allows

475
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,600
anyone to build their own ransomware too

476
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
it is actually a ransomware builder

477
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,839
that's written in.net and is actively

478
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,679
being sold on russian-speaking criminal

479
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,720
forums

480
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,919
and there are different theaters of

481
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,839
channels being sold right there is an

482
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,079
entry level there is a meet level and

483
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,160
there's the highest tier level right and

484
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
purchasing tenors at the highest tier is

485
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
akin to purchasing for support from the

486
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
developer forever right and we have

487
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,520
observed at crowdstrike right the tennis

488
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,599
ransomware is being actively employed by

489
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,760
low-level criminals right which you know

490
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
lowers the barrier of entry into

491
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,679
ventilation operations but at the same

492
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,799
time we have also observed some

493
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,640
state-sponsored adversaries particularly

494
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
two kittens right kittens being the

495
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,960
crypto name that crowdstrike uses on

496
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
adversaries that best and nexus to the

497
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,919
iranian government right and we saw two

498
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,400
kittens using thanos as part of that

499
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
repertoire so it's also interesting at

500
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,799
the same time right to observe typically

501
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,720
sophisticated adversaries right taking

502
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,360
to quote-unquote easy tooling right for

503
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
their actions in cyberspace

504
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,840
and here's a screenshot of how the

505
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
tennos ransomware builder actually looks

506
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
like you can see on the top segment

507
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
there is the option to create keys right

508
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
and that's of course there is that

509
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,919
option to incorporate recovery

510
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,600
information right on the top right hand

511
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,919
corner of the builder right and this

512
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,840
recovery information is actually really

513
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
the ransom note right what do you want a

514
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,080
random note to say right and as you can

515
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,840
see right many options and

516
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,520
functionalities are available in the

517
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,880
builder right and this makes it

518
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
exceedingly easy right to create a

519
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
tennis ransomware variant right and

520
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,320
after you're done with these steps

521
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,000
within the builder right you're actually

522
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,919
only left with a final step of figuring

523
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,679
out how to deliver the ransomware to

524
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,240
your target

525
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,240
so enough about the tennis ransomware

526
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,919
right when we talked about ransomware as

527
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,840
a service right we also see ransomware

528
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,360
as a service being substantively

529
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,880
utilized in the realm of big game

530
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
hunting right and the prime example is

531
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
found in the recent prolific attack on

532
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,440
the colonial pipeline in the u.s

533
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,200
just a little bit background on this

534
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,720
incident right if you're unaware

535
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,240
colonial pipeline is the largest

536
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,000
pipeline for refined oil products in the

537
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
us right it provides gasoline home

538
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
heating oil aviation fuel and other

539
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,400
refined petroleum products to the south

540
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,640
and eastern seaboard in the u.s right it

541
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,559
carries about 3 million barrels of fuel

542
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,360
each day from texas to new york

543
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
the dark side ransomware which is

544
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,039
available as which was then available as

545
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,880
a ransomware as a service was behind the

546
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,120
attack on the colonial pipeline right

547
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,640
the ransomware crippled the billing

548
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,039
system at colonial and though the ot

549
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,200
systems were not affected right colonial

550
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,039
pipeline decided to shut down the

551
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,200
pipeline as a precaution right due to

552
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,039
the concern that the hackers might have

553
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,640
obtained information that would allow

554
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
them to carry out further attacks on

555
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
vulnerable parts of the timeline

556
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,200
and in true big game hunting fashion the

557
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,760
adversary stole nearly 100 gigabytes of

558
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
data right and threatened to release it

559
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,799
on the internet if the ransom was not

560
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,360
paid it was reported that within hours

561
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
after the attack the company paid a

562
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
ransom of nearly 75 bitcoins which was

563
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
about 5 million us dollars at a point in

564
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
time to the hackers right in exchange

565
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,039
for decryption too right which

566
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,840
ironically proved so slow right that

567
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,080
colonials own backups right were used to

568
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,880
actually bring their systems back online

569
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,200
and of course the impact of such an

570
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
attack on critical infrastructure was

571
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,440
far-reaching right fewer shortages was

572
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
you know was was encountered right in at

573
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
least seven airports across the eastern

574
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,120
seaboard in the us which led to massive

575
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
disruptions to air travel right and the

576
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,200
media the media sensationalization of

577
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
the attack also resulted in some panic

578
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,280
across the general population which led

579
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,200
to the skyrocketing of fuel prices

580
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,440
so who is behind the dark side

581
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
ransomware right as you have already

582
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
alluded to earlier right the dark side

583
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
ransomware is attributed to none other

584
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,960
than carbon spider but wait right no

585
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,120
wasn't didn't we talk about carbon

586
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
spider earlier today but you know we

587
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,640
talked about common spider in the spirit

588
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,559
of being focused on targeting points of

589
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,559
sale systems instead of orchestrating

590
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,240
ransomware operations

591
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
so how did we get here

592
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,200
right so it turns out in early 2020

593
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,720
right with the onset of the copic 19

594
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,559
pandemic and the lockdown that followed

595
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,640
right the opportunity to target point

596
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,360
sources systems dwinded right because

597
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,559
everything had to you know everything

598
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,880
went online right e-commerce took over

599
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,200
brick and mota right shops in terms of

600
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,960
sales right so that's also when carbon

601
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
spider actually decided to get in on the

602
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,760
big game hunting ransomware game right

603
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
initially they partnered pinchy spider

604
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,000
right to deploy the rivo or our eva

605
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,880
ransomware s an affiliate right so on a

606
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,120
profit sharing model with pinchy spider

607
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,760
right then in august 2020 right carbon

608
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,919
spider decided to commit to big game

609
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,320
hunting and developed and use their own

610
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
ransomware right also

611
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,640
none other than the dark side ransomware

612
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
and since the introduction of ransom of

613
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,919
dark side right there has been

614
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,159
consistent updates to the ransomware

615
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,520
right and shortly after in november 2020

616
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,600
right carbon spider established by the

617
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
affiliate program for side right

618
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
offering dark side

619
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,679
as a ransomware as a service

620
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
and of course right as most of us are

621
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,080
aware right after the prolific attack on

622
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,559
colonial pipeline carbon spider was met

623
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,559
with law enforcement a severe law

624
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,039
enforcement response right which led in

625
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,400
to uh you know which resulted in a

626
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
series of physical arrests and you know

627
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
take downs of dark sides infrastructure

628
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,559
right the group then also announced that

629
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,559
they would cease dark side operations

630
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,480
right which was you know assessed to be

631
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,159
then the group's attempt to lay low

632
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,159
right after the amount of heat that was

633
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,480
being directed at them

634
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,000
during the period when dark side was

635
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,600
taken out of production you know

636
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,039
crowdstrike intelligence actually

637
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,799
interestingly continued to observe

638
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,240
activity that can be attributed to

639
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,799
carbon spider right we observed a text

640
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,320
that employed tooling that mostly

641
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,159
overlaps with carbon spider right with

642
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,919
the exception of using actually an open

643
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,840
source ransomware by the name of hidden

644
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,720
tear instead of the then retired dark

645
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,159
side

646
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,000
right and this phase of carbon spider

647
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
introducing new tools and ttps in a

648
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,480
post-dark side world continued for a

649
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,039
while until the emergence

650
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,559
of black metal

651
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,880
so in late july right crowdstrike

652
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
intelligence confirmed the existence of

653
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,200
a new ransomware as a service dart as

654
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,520
black metal right and it was quickly

655
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,760
discovered that there are cosmetic and

656
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,080
technical similarities between the now

657
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,240
defunct dark side and black metal right

658
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,760
there is significant overlaps in the

659
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,919
code base and there are many aesthetic

660
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,159
similarities in both ransomware's

661
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,840
control panels right as well as their

662
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
respective dedicated leak sites

663
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,159
during the same period there was also a

664
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,480
russian language forum member but that

665
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
goes by the same name right that goes by

666
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,320
black metal on the underground

667
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,960
advertising interest in purchasing and

668
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,039
executing unauthorized access right to

669
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,520
corporate networks right this persona

670
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,919
sought to purchase excesses in the us

671
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,799
canada australia and the uk and in true

672
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,880
big game hunting style was only

673
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
interested in purchasing access packages

674
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
of sizeable organizations right stating

675
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,840
that annual revenues of organizations

676
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,080
must be more than 100 million in usd

677
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,480
right and must have 500 to 15 000 hosts

678
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
right and since the emergence of the

679
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,159
black metal ransomware right the

680
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,000
ransomware has been successfully been

681
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,880
deployed against at least 40 victims

682
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
right the victim organization spends

683
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,799
numerous sectors and regions

684
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,880
demonstrating the opportunistic nature

685
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,279
right of you know ransomware campaigns

686
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,760
right and several ransom you know

687
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,840
payments right issued to relatively

688
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,559
large companies have topped more than 10

689
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,679
million dollars right us dollars

690
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,000
so clearly carbon spider does not show

691
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,480
any sign of stopping anytime soon so we

692
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,240
can expect right black metal campaigns

693
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,320
to continue in the short term

694
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,640
so enough on ransomware as a service

695
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,720
right now let's shift gears and speak to

696
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,960
an emergent class of e-crime adversaries

697
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,600
known as access brokers right to help us

698
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
understand how access brokerage

699
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,120
typically works here's a conceptual

700
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,279
abstraction of what typically happens

701
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,360
first a bot herder starts with an

702
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
initial infection this is going to

703
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,120
install a tool typically an information

704
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,679
stealer like raccoon steeler or azeroth

705
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,039
right there is aimed at harvesting

706
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,840
credentials and device configuration

707
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,360
data and as these credentials and

708
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
configuration data are being harvested

709
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,120
they are sent back to the bots for

710
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,279
collection and these bots are positioned

711
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,120
and deployed globally and after a

712
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,799
substantive amount of credentials have

713
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,559
been harvested in particularly

714
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
credentials at the domain admin level

715
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,039
they are consolidated as logs

716
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,559
and once this credentials have been

717
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,400
amassed right they will be pedaled on

718
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
the criminal underground right examples

719
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,960
include russian market market two easy

720
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
and genesis store right are probably the

721
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
three most prolific access broker shops

722
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,840
today right and then that achieves the

723
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,919
financial objective of these access

724
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,000
brokers

725
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,840
now let's take a look at an example of

726
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,760
one of the most prolific access brokers

727
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,840
of the day right this is a track actor

728
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,440
or an adversary that crowdstrike tracks

729
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,679
s percussion spider right this is a

730
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,080
prolific access broker based in turkey

731
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,640
and goes by a few different gnome digwa

732
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,559
or handles on the criminal underground

733
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,880
right you can find you know they go by

734
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
percussion spider also goes by drummer

735
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,840
lou or alvin carrick on the criminal

736
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,159
underground right and even though

737
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,880
percussion spider offers a white

738
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,960
portfolio of excess beam pedal right it

739
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,600
actually has a laser focus on governance

740
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,919
oil and gas and technology companies

741
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,600
right what's interesting to note here

742
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,840
right is that percussion spider actually

743
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,679
partnered with the tenors ransomware

744
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,679
developer in the early days right they

745
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,360
will observe to be mutually boosting

746
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,120
each other's reputation right or the

747
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
equivalent of the digital equivalent of

748
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
street cred right on the criminal

749
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,120
underground right you know this digital

750
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
version of singing high praises of one

751
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,679
another being very good you know and

752
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,080
what did each of them do right actually

753
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,480
helped both percussion spider and the

754
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,360
tennis ransomware developer right to go

755
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,440
a long way right because this dynamic

756
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
propelled percussion spider to become a

757
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,600
prolific access broker and at the same

758
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,520
time substantively increase the

759
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,480
utilization of the tennos ransomware

760
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,240
and as we speak percussion spider

761
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,400
continues to evolve their content their

762
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,240
you know their capabilities while

763
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,400
monetizing the sale of you know domain

764
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,360
admin credentials high profile access

765
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,039
packages and so and so forth

766
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,919
and this you know gives you a you know

767
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,760
an overview of

768
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,600
the targets right off percussion spider

769
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,919
right and this should speak volumes of

770
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,799
how prolific percussion spider is as you

771
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,799
know is performing as an access broker

772
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,720
today

773
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,159
and this is actually how it looks like

774
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,559
in reality right this is an active track

775
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,720
on exploit forum where percussion spider

776
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,200
is known to be pedaling access packages

777
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,279
right and this is just

778
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,039
a few samples right of some of these

779
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,520
access packages that you know percussion

780
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,600
spider has been pedaling offly

781
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,679
so now moving away from access brokers

782
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,039
right now let's shift gears and look at

783
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,960
malware as a service for a few moments

784
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,799
right and one of the best examples of a

785
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,960
prolific e-cram adversary offering malwa

786
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,559
as a service is none other than smoky

787
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,480
spider right smokey spider is the

788
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
criminal actor behind the development of

789
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,399
the criminal loader most commonly known

790
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,559
as smoke block smokebot smokeloader or

791
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,080
dufoy right

792
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,520
smokebot has been available on the

793
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
criminal underground since 2011 and has

794
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,679
gone through various changes since right

795
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,600
the loader is primarily used to download

796
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
and execute modules that are sold by

797
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,360
smokyspider or third-party malware

798
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
provided by the criminal operator and

799
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,159
for as long as smokebox has crea existed

800
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,799
right the actor smokey spider releases

801
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,440
minor updates on the monthly basis with

802
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,880
further major updates released annually

803
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,399
like this diligent maintenance of

804
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,960
smokebot along with its affordability

805
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,360
and flexibility has led to the

806
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,039
increasing popularity of the malware

807
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,880
and to give you a sense of how popular

808
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,760
smokebot is right this is the gamut of

809
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,440
e-crime adversaries and malware

810
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,120
operators that smokey spiders sold

811
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,240
access to smallbot 2. there are at least

812
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
seven named crowdstrike e-crime

813
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,159
adversaries that have a long history of

814
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,240
buying access to smokeboard and just

815
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,320
look at the laundry the adjacent laundry

816
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,440
list of information stealers ransomware

817
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,600
downloaders banking trojans remote

818
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,159
access tools cryptocurrency steelers

819
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
proxy malware and spambot operators that

820
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,120
all have unknown access to smoky spider

821
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,679
right since you know the takedown of

822
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,000
imotet or mummy spider some time ago

823
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
right smokey spider with smoke bought

824
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
right probably comes close to being the

825
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,159
next top contender right which

826
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,880
epitomizes a successful and enduring

827
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
malware as a service provider right on

828
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,840
the criminal underground today

829
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,200
and again this is how it looks like in

830
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,279
reality right this is an active threat

831
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,279
on a gain exploit forum where smoky

832
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,679
spider advertises the sale of smoke ball

833
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,679
in the spirit of product marketing right

834
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,600
smokey spider provides an overview of

835
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,520
smokebot's capabilities right on the

836
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,360
live on the screenshot on the left and

837
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,679
smokebox pricing right on the screenshot

838
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,159
on the right

839
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,960
and to provide the prospective buyer a

840
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,840
sense of the ui and ux right of smoke

841
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,080
board right smoky spider also offers

842
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,559
like screen shots of smoke bots like

843
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,399
gooey right on the thread where it's

844
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,039
pedaling smog

845
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,720
so last but not least right you know

846
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,240
let's shift guess again to look at the

847
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,760
last you know

848
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
topic that we will discuss in terms of

849
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,799
you know when we are exploring this

850
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,320
notion of everything as a service on the

851
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
criminal underground and now let's look

852
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,399
at some of the most prolific cryptic

853
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,000
services that exist on the criminal

854
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,159
underground today right and the use of

855
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,240
cryptic services right also known as

856
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
packing or protection services right are

857
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,399
provided by e-crime you know vendors

858
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,399
right to other actors right to prevent

859
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,240
the detection of their malware by

860
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,000
anti-virus engines

861
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
criminal vendors often refer to their

862
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,399
ability to make malware undetectable as

863
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,320
fully undetectable or fud or fat right

864
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,399
and this process can involve various

865
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,240
techniques right including the use of an

866
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,159
automation pipeline a standalone

867
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,360
application that's provided by the

868
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,440
vendor or manual techniques performed by

869
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,159
the vendor they encrypt or austin skates

870
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,880
right a final payload in order to thwart

871
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,120
signal based signature based detections

872
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,360
right on this or in memory right and

873
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,159
these

874
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,159
are you know some of the most prolific

875
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,480
examples of crypting services that exist

876
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,840
today on the criminal underground

877
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
let's first spend a few moments speaking

878
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,799
to vip and luck script right both

879

that they tested the rival or are evil

890
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,840

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,880
rates by av engines

909
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,360
lux creep is advertised by an actor that

910
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,000

1010
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,200
you know to put all that we have

1011
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
discussed in the context right let's

1012
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
look at a conceptual abstraction of a

1013
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,280
modern ransomware attack right and it

1014
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,119
starts typically with a malware

1015
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,280
downloader right with something like you

1016
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,800
know smoke bought by smokey spider that

1017
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
we discussed or bog bought right luna

1018
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,119
spider billuda spider and this mulberry

1019
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,960
downloader is typically used to deploy a

1020
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,200
traditional banking trojan right like

1021
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,839
like trickbot or crackbot

1022
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,680
right and then this banking trojan is

1023
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,760
then used to facilitate lateral movement

1024
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,079
around right the network

1025
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,000
right around the victims of victims

1026
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,320
environment right typically using living

1027
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,760
off the land techniques or malware free

1028
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,520
techniques using native tools or

1029
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,960
legitimate third-party tools that

1030
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,800
already exist on this compromise

1031
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,880
endpoints right and this typically also

1032
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,480
involves you know the adversaries

1033
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,320
pulling down their own tooling right

1034
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,839
that eventually leads to something even

1035
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,520
more nefarious

1036
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
and adversaries at this stage right are

1037
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,680
looking for the target organization's

1038
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,440
crown jewels right this could mean

1039
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,160
mission critical systems or data or

1040
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
requisite like admin privileges right to

1041
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,839
achieve their eventual objectives right

1042
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,000
which typically takes the form of owning

1043
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,839
the domain controller right to achieve

1044
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,119
enterprise-wide deployment of the

1045
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,119
ransomware

1046
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,320
and after they get to the

1047
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,400
mission-critical systems or data this is

1048
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,320
where the adversary would you know steal

1049
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,200
and exfiltrate the sensitive data and

1050
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
this all kind of comes to a close

1051
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,200
typically with the deployment of the

1052
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,079
ransomware proper right with rio right

1053
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,520
wizard being

1054
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,119
wizard spider being the adversary behind

1055
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,040
it and black metal carbon spider being

1056
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,480
adversary behind it as just two examples

1057
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
so as you would notice right in this

1058
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,800
e-crime attack sequence right

1059
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,680
this

1060
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,079
attack right can involve at least three

1061
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,079
or more e-cram adversaries right and

1062
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,680
this has yet to include the element of

1063
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,079
the excess broker or even the

1064
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,320
adversary that facilitates monetization

1065
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,960
right post-extortion right in some there

1066
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,839
is evidently right and very prolific and

1067
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,960
thriving e-crime ecosystem at work here

1068
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,800
right this abstraction of an e-cram

1069
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,640
attack is also essential right because

1070
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,880
despite the valid efforts of many

1071
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,200
security teams today at attempting to

1072
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,880
stem ransomware deployment

1073
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,440
by doing so they are likely to miss the

1074
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,680
earlier stages right off an e-crime

1075
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,520
attack right basically the stuff that

1076
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,440
happens upstream right it would be

1077
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,920
meaningful therefore right to calibrate

1078
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,520
your detection right to ensure

1079
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,160
visibility on the stages upstream

1080
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,079
and in a similar vein it would also be

1081
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,680
productive to hunt for the attack

1082
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,000
vectors upstream to effectively defend

1083
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,280
yourself against an e-crime attack

1084
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,359
right so now understanding how an e-cram

1085
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,520
attack typically unfolds how do you then

1086
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,200
get on the front foot against this

1087
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,520
thread

1088
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,680
it really starts you know this really

1089
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,440
starts with intelligence consumption

1090
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,040
right which typically takes the form of

1091
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
reading intelligence reports right

1092
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,160
boring or dry as it may sound it truly

1093
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
matters right because reading

1094
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,920
intelligence reports will allow you to

1095
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,000
establish a contextual understanding of

1096
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,160
the threat right reading reports and

1097
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,599
understanding topics right like the

1098
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,960
e-crime attack sequence that we just

1099
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
covered in the slide before all the

1100
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,640
trending attack vectors that target

1101
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,800
specific industries right you know

1102
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,720
learning those lessons so that you can

1103
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,560
avoid becoming the next victim of a

1104
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,800
similar attack right it is a known

1105
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
common practice for adversaries to

1106
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,480
target victims of the same industry and

1107
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,079
will target those that they think that

1108
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,440
they will be able to monetize with a

1109
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,040
successful attack

1110
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,560
right

1111
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,720
beyond the intelligence reports you know

1112
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,240
we all have we all should also

1113
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,920
acknowledge that technology is going to

1114
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,319
be a key enabler right first there is

1115
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,480
that dimension around leveraging tools

1116
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,800
to programmatically achieve intelligent

1117
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,920
automation

1118
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,319
right to achieve intelligence-led

1119
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,280
security operations right

1120
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,720
you will also want to think about using

1121
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,440
a tool to proactively hunt and monitor

1122
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,599
the deep and dark web right to uncover

1123
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,520
incidents and developments on the

1124
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,079
criminal underground such as the entire

1125
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,760
gamut of topics that we have discussed

1126
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
earlier today right and understanding

1127
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,599
how this developments on the criminal

1128
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,440
underground may have an impact on your

1129
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,599
organization

1130
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,760
of course at the same time we must also

1131
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,440
acknowledge that technology is not going

1132
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,680
to be a silver bullet solution right

1133
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,119
having you know 247 manage human-based

1134
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,280
threat hunting that sits on top of the

1135
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,880
technology right it's vital in

1136
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
preventing many of this modern attacks

1137
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,720
right especially when it comes to living

1138
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,480
off land techniques it becomes

1139
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,800
exceedingly important like to have

1140
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,599
humans with eyes on the data catching

1141
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,520
the unique hands on keyboard activity

1142
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,599
right that technology just has a

1143
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,720
fundamental difficulty with identifying

1144
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,560
and last but not least should the

1145
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,359
unthinkable happen it's always about

1146
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,359
having a service partner who's on speed

1147
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,680
down that is ready to support you with

1148
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,359
timely response and remediation

1149
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,280
and with that i would like to leave you

1150
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,839
with this statement today right really

1151
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,079
your ability right to defeat the most

1152
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,520
advanced adversaries of the day right to

1153
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,839
outsmart the most sophisticated e-crime

1154
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,920
criminals out there right

1155
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,839
restless really upon your understanding

1156
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,040
of the problem

1157
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,720
right if you don't understand how an

1158
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,040
e-crime attack typically unfolds

1159
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,400
or you don't know much about this

1160
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,800
prolific e-crime ecosystem and how these

1161
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,560
developments that take place on this

1162
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,240
underground right may impact your

1163
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,440
organization

1164
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,400
right

1165
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,599
what you are doing here is that you are

1166
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,599
just inadvertently preventing yourself

1167
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,520
to be effective in the fight against

1168
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,160
these adversaries

1169
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,079
with that i would like to thank you for

1170
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,319
your time and participation today i look

1171
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,160
forward to your questions and know that

1172
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,880
i'm always a ping away and i'm happy to

1173
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,440
talk about all things cyber security

1174
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,880
