1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,400
chess is an exciting and strategic game

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,200
but when it comes to sign the chess

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,280
most people would not know it and

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,640
especially no consent is given before

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,279
cyber attackers strike and bring you

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,279
into their game

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,880
as businesses and individuals become

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,599
unwilling participants or players in

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,160
this game of chess this session will

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
reveal new perspectives and tips for you

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
to take control

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
my name is shamin tan and i lead the

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,840
outreach strategy aimed at helping

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,600
c-suite executives

15

cyber may day and the day after is my

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,280
latest book that's coming out this

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,600
november which will cover true cyber

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
emergency stories from leaders around

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,480
the world

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
it's also a guide for businesses to

prepare manage and recover from the

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,799
inevitable cyber disruptions

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,799
you guys are actually one of the first

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,439
few to get a sneak peek into some of the

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,080
key insights that's from the book and i

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,320
will cover a few true cyber emergency

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,119
stories as well across educational

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,320
logistics

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,400
banking and financial sector and we

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
might even make a trip to the moon if we

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,840
have time

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,720
we will also explore some common excuses

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,759
to best practice equity including

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,479
interesting framework that can help you

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,520
with your crisis communications

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
now let's start off first with the

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
educational sector so nus is known for

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,640
the academic programs

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,520
ranked amongst the top globally

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
when it comes to security they are

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,479
pretty advanced for the educational

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,040
sector and they were one of the very

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,000
first to do their own fishing drills as

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,360
early as 2013 before the fishing drills

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
platform even became popular

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
they also formed their computer

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
emergency response team which was more

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
than 10 years ago

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,760
in fact they were one of singapore's

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
first certs

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
i really liked the fact that this was

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,080
way back before even security became a

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,319
thing and this university already has

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,000
embraced the foresight

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
and thinking in terms of implementing

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,520
preemptive measures

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,080
now they are a great example of having

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,560
their chest pieces ready

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
so the question then is this

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,760
what happens when the hackers make their

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,879
move

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,560
players are you ready

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,840
in 2017 nus along with the other local

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,760
universities suffered from one of the

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,319
largest security breaches in singapore

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,480
and this was a result of a bid to steal

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
government and research data it was the

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,200
biggest ever attack the university

72
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,599
suffered from and this was the work of a

73
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,399
sophisticated nation-state threat actor

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,599
who is the i.t head of security revealed

75
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,319
that this major cyber incident

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,040
years ago triggered a positive change in

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,599
the way the university has executed

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,400
their cybersecurity strategy since then

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,959
in my upcoming book that's going to be

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,159
released in the us in november and then

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,319
on the rest of the world later on in

82
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,640
december and jan so leon bone actually

83
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,560
shared in this book as well that through

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,239
that one incident

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,000
everyone realized what it was like to

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
fight a real battle out there it was the

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,920
first time they had a full-blown war

88
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,319
room they leave and ate in their room

89
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
for two weeks or more and it was the

90
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,760
first time that their different

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,840
colleagues within it all sat down

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
together with them in that room to

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
investigate to find root causes and to

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,480
resolve issues together

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,720
so through that it was an experience

96
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,280
that all of them remembered and no and

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
one experience that no one would want to

98
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,720
relieve

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,560
contrasting to previously where they

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
were all mostly focused on incident

101
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
response which is more reactive they

102
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
have now moved on to a predictive

103
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,519
approach where they leverage on threat

104
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,918
intelligence to provide an added layer

105
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,639
of visibility of who might be attacking

106
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,840
them and the different ttps that you

107
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
know have been used like tactics

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,919
techniques and procedures that

109
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,680
they could be using

110
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
so the incident ended up being a very

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,560
powerful lesson that created a lot of

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,919
positivity in the organization

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,120
in further extracts of the book leon

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
boone also said that he believed that

115
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,160
the best way to learn about cyber

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,800
security is really through experiencing

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,320
and handling real-world attacks

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
the main reason that the team has

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,800
remained very competent is because of

120
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
their contact with various kinds of

121
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,000
incidents that they have handled over

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
the years

123
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,039
now moving on to the logistics sector

124
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,160
it was may 2020 toll group the logistic

125
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,479
giant that operates in an extensive

126
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,759
diverse road sc and rail freight

127
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,400
transport services across 1 200

128
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
locations in more than 50 over countries

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,680
suddenly went offline now this was not

130
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
the first time because in early 2020 to

131
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
already suffered from another major

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
cyber attack that devastated its it

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,000
systems so after the first attacks the

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
business owners were increasingly really

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,479
frustrated about like their untraceable

136
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,759
packages and missing deliveries social

137
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,560
media obviously was full of people

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
expressing their disappointment

139
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,440
and this seemed like a horrible deja vu

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,520
all over again for the business because

141
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,319
most people wouldn't like to reminisce

142
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,720
what happened right when the hackers

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
make their move

144
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,560
and especially when you are caught in

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
the middle of a cyber emergency but king

146
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,560
lee who is chose cio shared his insider

147
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
story with me he said if you have ever

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
gone through a cyber attack you wouldn't

149
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,520
wish it on anyone else and unfortunately

150
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
toe went through all of that within a

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
three month period

152
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
toe engaged a crisis management process

153
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,400
during that time they put a business

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
continuity plan a bcp in place started

155
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,759
communicating to their employees their

156
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
customers regulators and the media

157
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
this was put in place very quickly to

158
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
control the environment and to also

159
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,479
notify their employees

160
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,759
for the following few weeks toe

161
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,680
painstakingly work to recover the whole

162
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
system and bring their business

163
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,759
operations back online

164
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,240
after tolls first attack they found

165
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
already that there were areas of their

166
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
bcps that could have been improved even

167
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,880
further and even up to today they asked

168
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
you working with your customers to

169
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
fine-tune your bcp to face new incidents

170
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,759
in the future

171
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
king shared with me that what really is

172
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
key is the ability to communicate all

173
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,000
the time consistently and provide the

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,720
information to all the parties

175
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
and that is extremely critical because

176
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,039
if they do not communicate well enough

177
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,840
or detailed enough or clear enough

178
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
rumors are going to be filling the void

179
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,479
so instead of letting people speculate

180
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
the best is to really just communicate

181
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,599
up front what is happening

182
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
king said that we need to make sure that

183
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
as we bring the systems back up and

184
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
online again it has got to be better

185
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,840
safer and stronger than before we went

186
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
down

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
my question to you is this

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
during the incident is there time to

189
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,680
think

190
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,280
you know have you actually seen what

191
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
happens in a ransomware attack so what

192
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,039
i'm going to share next is an actual

193
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,080
real-life scenario negotiation between a

194
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
ransomware gang and a 15 billion

195
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,759
dollars victim company that was hit with

196
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,240
a 28.75 million ransom in january 2021.

197
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,759
some of you will probably find this very

198
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,319
familiar

199
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
so for this company all of their systems

200
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,039
were locked and then they found this

201
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,720
message that your network has been

202
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,639
locked you need to pay 30 million us

203
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,159
dollars now

204
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
imagine how the team was feeling at the

205
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,399
very moment as they are frantically

206
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
trying to respond

207
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,479
combining that with the time pressure

208
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,120
and also with the awareness that the bad

209
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
guys are watching their every move so

210
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
it's uh very disconcerting and the bad

211
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
guys actually wrote them this message

212
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
that oh it's really funny to see all

213
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,000
your admins trying to reinstall your

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
exchange server in three days and you

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,519
still can't do it you know we have

216
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,279
encrypted five thousand out of six

217
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
thousand of your servers and if you do

218
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
some very simple calculation your

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,600
expenditure for example might be 50 or

220
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,160
50 per hour or if you're more generous

221
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,800
you're paying your stuff 65 per hour so

222
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,240
20 times 24 hours and the number of the

223
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
servers encrypted

224
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,519
times the time you take to get up it's

225
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,880
going to cost you about 10 million

226
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,959
dollars and that's just on your labor

227
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,279
expenditure

228
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,959
this was everything the hackers were

229
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,800
communicating with there's no compassion

230
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,959
or empathy and they were very very

231
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,560
sarcastic

232
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
they even proceeded to tell them that

233
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,480
the time was ticking and in the next

234
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,880
eight hours your price tag will go up to

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
60 million so either you take our

236
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,839
generous offer and pay us 28.75 million

237
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,279
or invest in quantum computing and

238
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,000
expedite the decryption process

239
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,440
so the company ultimately paid an 11

240
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
million dollar ransom with the criminals

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
assuring them that they will not attack

242
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,399
them again or help anyone else attack

243
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
their network moving forward

244
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
now

245
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,839
in the earlier examples we have all seen

246
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,480
what happens when mayday strikes

247
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
but before anything happens

248
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
that is when we need to be actually

249
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
addressing the mindsets and perspectives

250
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
i mentioned earlier that i will take you

251
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,079
to the moon

252
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,920
so a couple of months

253
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
ago i was speaking to preston miller who

254
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
was the cecil of nasa's jet propulsion

255
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,959
lab and the nasa is you know spending

256
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
more than half a billion dollars on

257
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,680
their space exploration efforts and it's

258
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
important for them to be able to restore

259
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,480
any critical operations in a very timely

260
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,959
fashion but preston also shared with me

261
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,680
that

262
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
in his previous sector he came from the

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,920
pentagon right where they supported war

264
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,040
fighters

265
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
and confidentiality was at the top of

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,560
the triad the cia confidentiality

267
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,800
integrity availability and they have to

268
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
ensure that the messages that they are

269
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,519
relaying is extremely confidential

270
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,760
around their message and operations

271
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,160
right but at nasa integrity was actually

272
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,079
the top of their list which is different

273
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,800
from c confidential because they have to

274
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
keep the data that they are sharing safe

275
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,880
and they have to make sure that as they

276
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,240
are sharing these messages back and

277
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
forth between their communities they

278
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
have to trust the data and also trust

279
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,160
the data that is being sent back and

280
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
forth the

281
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
spacecraft and the operations so it's

282
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,839
really important to understand how your

283
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,560
business defines risk and then learn how

284
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,279
to communicate back in a really relevant

285
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,360
manner

286
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
now one can understand how you know your

287
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
business defines risk but at the same

288
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,079
time you can still neglect having good

289
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
practices

290
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,079
how many of us have taken the time to

291
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,560
examine the actions of those leaders who

292
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,440
have been in crisis mode and have had to

293
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,839
take their businesses through a disaster

294
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,560
with the hindsight that they now possess

295
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,360
i find that such lessons are often

296
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
invaluable in helping us have a better

297
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,720
foresight and action plan you know start

298
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,880
early that's what they always advise

299
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,399
because when you are in the midst of a

300
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,760
crisis it's neither the time or space to

301
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,560
even start thinking or planning

302
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,720
but how many of you have found that

303
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
these common excuses

304
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
still come into play when best practices

305
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
are not implemented

306
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
the cio magazine actually offers about

307
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
10 common excuses that people gives and

308
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,720
all of them hits home

309
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
and often perhaps also they offer the

310
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
most compelling explanation you know as

311
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,680
to why so many vulnerabilities are not

312
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
patched and why there are holes in cyber

313
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
security defenses why these are not

314
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,560
addressed in ongoing ways

315
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
so i did a much deeper study with my

316
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,519
co-author dan lorman who was the first

317
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,920
cesar of the state of michigan and

318
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
together we provided a lot of solutions

319
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
to address this further in the book but

320
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
for the sake of time and also in the

321
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,320
interest of sharing this with the

322
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
audience today i will just cover a few

323
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
key ones here

324
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,680
so common excuses would be we did not

325
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,120
have the time we could not afford it

326
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,600
the business didn't understand why it

327
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,800
was necessary we tried it before it

328
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,160
didn't work it's too hard to be honest

329
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,320
we were afraid of what we might discover

330
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,480
so one of the chapters which is uh

331
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,120
turning cyber incident lemons into

332
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,360
organizational lemonade

333
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,920
i provided a comprehensive coverage of

334
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,880
tips and solutions to help everyone

335
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,079
overcome these common excuses and better

336
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,079
manage preparing for cyber emergencies

337
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,480
but for security leaders here here are

338
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
some question checklists that i've put

339
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,160
together that will really like suggest

340
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,800
to you to challenge your thinking and to

341
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,639
ensure that you are asking the right

342
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,639
questions in

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
attempting to do with these objections

344
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
right so when it comes to time where are

345
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
we spending the bulk of our time are we

346
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,959
allocating our time proportionately

347
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,519
according to the criticality levels of

348
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,519
risk that's a good question to ask

349
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,480
yourself

350
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
are there other areas where that we are

351
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
spending our budget on that can be

352
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,880
reallocated at the moment how does our

353
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
budget align with the company's strategy

354
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,000
and business risk

355
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,079
that's another way to reshape the

356
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,839
conversation what is the current

357
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,320
security awareness culture like among

358
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
the leadership team is that something

359
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,839
you're aware of or how does it differ

360
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,639
according to the different divisions

361
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,160
or what was the organizational

362
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
environment like before when your

363
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
approach didn't work you know perhaps

364
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
what can be changed maybe you can

365
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,279
execute things differently this time or

366
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,040
have you look at the mechanics of

367
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,760
influence

368
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,399
have you tried getting allies as well so

369
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,320
that it's not just you fighting an

370
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,880
organizational battle are there other

371
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,199
battles that might result in better

372
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,959
outcomes that you can be channeling your

373
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,440
energy to or focusing on or what are

374
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,519
some other smaller initial commitments

375
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,480
you can first focus on in securing

376
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,079
buy-in from your stakeholders and then

377
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,600
you can work your way on getting more

378
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
buy-in after that

379
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
are you comfortable with not knowing

380
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,040
what other malicious attackers that are

381
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
out there

382
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
and what they know about your company

383
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,399
right how are you managing your risk if

384
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,880
you do not even know what needs to be

385
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
managed so we need to be constantly

386
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,440
learning from these incidents whether is

387
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,240
it internally or externally and even if

388
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
they don't directly impact us at the

389
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,360
moment

390
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,040
yuval illus is the group cso and the ceo

391
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
of trust data resilience is a standard

392
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
chartered bank a global bank that we

393
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,440
know about you know it's headquartered

394
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,839
in the uk and he currently leads more

395
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
than 2 000 employees globally across

396
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,440
cyber security business continuity and

397
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,680
operational resilience for the group and

398
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,440
he's based in singapore

399
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,480
so yuval revealed to me in the book the

400
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,199
cyber may day and the day after about

401
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,279
the continuous exercise that he has

402
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,000
implemented within the bank known as the

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
near-miss exercise

404
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,759
so running a near-miss exercise is

405
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
actually based on recent incidents now

406
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,240
although they were not affected right

407
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
they found that it really significantly

408
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
helped them identify areas of

409
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
improvements and help them be better

410
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
prepared for the next attack and these

411
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
areas of improvement might relate to a

412
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,800
missing action in their playbook a weak

413
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,920
control coverage a broken process a

414
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,560
missing or perhaps not up to date policy

415
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,639
and many many more so they found that

416
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,639
this is a great opportunity to take a

417
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,279
proactive action to uplift the

418
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,839
resilience of the whole organization

419
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,519
and it combined this near near-miss

420
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
exercises with their continuous crisis

421
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,280
management simulations and then they

422
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
have end up building a really more

423
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,119
resilient and cyber ready organization

424
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,319
if we recognize that disruption is

425
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,679
continuous

426
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,599
rather than just looking at it based on

427
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,839
an episode level we can really shift our

428
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,000
response from being reactive

429
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,280
to making the first move

430
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
so here are five tips you know about

431
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,679
what you can do about good practice

432
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,799
empathy

433
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,559
and some tips to help

434
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,679
you know make failure real so exercises

435
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,160
are a must right practice practice

436
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,120
practice

437
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,520
it's important to know your mindset and

438
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
what is the leadership's view on cyber

439
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,160
failures

440
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
who is accountable

441
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,400
how can you build a culture right that

442
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,360
works

443
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,600
and and also a work environment that

444
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
does not finger point or blame but

445
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,080
encourage transparency in sharing

446
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
lessons that have been learned and

447
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,880
mistakes that are owned

448
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
fmea i don't know how many are familiar

449
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
that failure mode effects analysis you

450
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,440
know create a structured process because

451
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,679
this also helps in creating really good

452
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,720
habits

453
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,679
but if you take it a step further it

454
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,840
helps you also know what industry peers

455
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,360
if you know what your industry peers are

456
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
using and how does your process

457
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,160
benchmark against that yes that is also

458
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,120
a really important um thing to know

459
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,000
and early identification of business

460
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,400
operational continuity measures so you

461
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,240
know have regular reports on readiness

462
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
to management what has been the impact

463
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
on other organizations who do not have a

464
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
bcp

465
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,280
how does your bcb compare in your

466
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,039
industry sector

467
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,200
what are the different lessons learned

468
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,240
each time that your bcp is being run

469
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,480
don't always report bad news but be

470
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,799
conscious of showing trends of

471
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,760
improvement as well

472
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,480
and then we have methodology change

473
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,280
control so what is the process at the

474
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,320
moment you know refine improve and keep

475
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,960
testing how often have you reviewed your

476
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,919
process are there ways of doing this

477
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,160
more effectively

478
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
and finally get a second opinion right

479
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,160
constantly be looking to improve third

480
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,960
party experts can provide a fresh look

481
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,400
and you know we are all stronger

482
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
together right so how can you play on

483
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,360
your strengths while leveraging the

484
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,320
community or collaborating with existing

485
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,840
or new partnerships to help complement

486
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,240
and also strengthen your business case

487
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
oftentimes we have our head in the

488
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,120
ground when a crisis strikes yet if we

489
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
look up there is an opportunity to gain

490
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,400
perspective and clearer perspective on

491
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,679
the problem and subsequently formulate

492
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,080
better solutions i know we have all

493
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,240
missed flying immensely and there are

494
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
many lessons we can actually learn from

495
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,200
research literature even on aviation

496
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,240
mysteries and missing airplane events

497
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
including how they are communicating how

498
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,919
they communicating crisis right so

499
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,799
crisis communications researcher

500
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,760
kevin cook yutan is someone that i've

501
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,320
spoken to extensively and he shared with

502
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,480
me about his research and development on

503
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,200
the console framework which stands for

504
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,799
coherence orientation nuance support

505
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,760
ongoing leadership and emotions so this

506
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,440
framework is really used to guide

507
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,480
practitioners on how to break bad news

508
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,240
effectively to their stakeholders during

509
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,960
a crisis and it's arguably the first

510
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,919
framework integrate that was established

511
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,440
in terms of integrating the medical

512
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,240
protocols with crisis communications on

513
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,400
literature so this research examined

514
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,480
like all these great aviation crisis

515
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,240
throughout history and how they

516
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,159
communicate all of that and then they

517
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,919
look at the shortcomings of it against

518
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,039
the console framework and as i further

519
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,880
research and do this i realize that the

520
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,360
core of it can be applied effectively

521
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
when it's when you're dealing with cyber

522
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
incident scenarios

523
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,880
so how do you break bad news with

524
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
console

525
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,080
always state the incident clearly be

526
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,880
specific and consistent that's very

527
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,000
important

528
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
so for example you know company x would

529
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
like to provide an update regarding the

530
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,280
status of data breach of xyz records

531
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,640
names birth dates addresses and you know

532
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,120
they were publicly accessible on the web

533
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,960
server it was managed by a third party

534
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
provider and this was due to a human

535
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,000
error of an employee of the third party

536
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,799
fandom and we will provide more updates

537
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,600
as we progress in our investigations

538
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
do not downplay the seriousness of the

539
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,400
incident

540
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,840
or the risk of excess and misuse and

541
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,480
avoid leaving information vacuum for

542
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
others to feel you have to show your

543
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
customers that you care about their

544
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
personal information

545
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,360
and you care about their concerns as

546
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,240
much as they do

547
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,280
empathy you know communicate message in

548
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,039
really high emotional support and

549
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,679
exhibit sensitivity

550
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,080
for example company x is deeply

551
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,440
regretful to have caused any concerns

552
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
with your customers as having their

553
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,919
customers trust is of great importance

554
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,520
we are conducting a thorough review of

555
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,640
our overall security technology process

556
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
and people we are focused on our

557
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,200
customers protection and have developed

558
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,320
a comprehensive service to support

559
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,360
everyone regardless of whether they were

560
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,120
impacted by this incident or not

561
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,240
next is to state the actions taken to

562
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,520
perform the remediation

563
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,080
upon being notified companyx took the

564
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,720
immediate steps xyz to contain and

565
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,600
breach

566
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,919
the to contain the breach and notify

567
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,360
affected individuals

568
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,600
leadership organizations need to take

569
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
the lead to show the way your hate and

570
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,520
the options are available to the

571
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
stakeholders

572
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,960
company x has established a dedicated

573
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,400
website that customers can visit if

574
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
there's additional questions

575
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,679
or call a dedicated call center or

576
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,360
toll-free number for direct assistance

577
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,159
next up is support so don't forget to

578
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,440
mention any support teams or channels

579
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,159
that's really important because um

580
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,919
people need to know that these options

581
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,919
are available for them so company x will

582
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,320
continue to exert great effort in

583
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
providing customers with any ongoing

584
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,919
assistance

585
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,240
during the investigation

586
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,559
company x remains committed to achieving

587
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,120
the best outcomes for its customers and

588
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,600
will take all reasonable steps necessary

589
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,520
to achieving this

590
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,320
it is important to state actions or

591
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,799
changes that will be taken

592
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,120
moving forward to prevent future

593
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
occurrences

594
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,120
nuance orientation and ongoing so those

595
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,400
are the last three elements

596
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,720
organizations need to provide easy to

597
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,799
understand technical information

598
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,720
and have a strong understanding of your

599
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,559
audience as well because you need to

600
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,080
anticipate like your stakeholders

601
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,039
concerns or any questions so that will

602
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,919
be the orientation part and lastly you

603
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,080
need to have continuous communication

604
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
and make sure it's a two-way engagement

605
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,559
so that's all for ongoing you have to

606
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,960
provide stakeholders the opportunity to

607
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,760
address any concerns or questions and

608
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,640
look at a variety of platforms to reach

609
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,840
out to the affected individuals

610
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
over notification is also not an issue

611
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,600
because on the contrary

612
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,120
individuals are actually more

613
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,679
appreciative in receiving direct and

614
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,720
comprehensive communication

615
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
one quick thing i just want to highlight

616
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,000
is the nuance part because you have to

617
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,159
make sure that you don't overload with

618
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,400
too much technical information it will

619
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,360
get lost in translation as well so

620
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,600
that's really key in your crisis

621
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,039
communication

622
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,960
so this brings me back to my earlier

623
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
question as you can see there's so much

624
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,279
prep work involved and required

625
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,679
beforehand and also to equip you during

626
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,840
the crisis so players are you ready

627
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,760
someone has to make the first move and

628
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,799
this question is who will it be the

629
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,840
hackers or you

630
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,360
and when the game finally begins how

631
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,840
confident are you in saying checkmate

632
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,159
so that's all i have for you today it's

633
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,640
a big pleasure of mine to be able to

634
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,799
share this with you and i'm always happy

635
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
