the options of the path that you can

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,439
take within cyber security and last but

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,840
not least share with you what cfc is

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,360
built for and what we can do to help you

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,880
get a career in cyber security

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,080
with that i would like to introduce

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,960
myself a bit so i am a tedx speaker

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
entrepreneur ex-medical student and an

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
author so i came from outside of the

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,360
field of cyber security until this year

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
where i went head first in my passion

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
has always been in creating the right

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
culture for businesses and for

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,079
individuals to shine in their careers

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,320
and in cyber security i find that this

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,280
is where i seem to be able to find

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,840
you know kind of alignment with what

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
they are doing in cyber security and in

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,759
the last few months of me being in cyber

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,240
security i want to say i've fallen in

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
love with it and why did i

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
fall in love with cyber security so

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,640
first up it is a technically challenging

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,318
career when we talk about this i don't

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,318
mean it in the form of it is really hard

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,120
to understand you need to work so hard

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
no no it's all about

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
the fact that it is something that

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
always engages you there's always new

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
things to learn there's always new ways

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
to learn new things there's

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,879
also so much resources available for you

61
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,879
to learn from right this stack overflow

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,080
there's a lot of places where you can

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,200
learn stuff

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
it requires you to have a conceptual

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
understanding about cyprus security in

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
the whole it requires you to touch on

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,239
things like network and all these

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,080
different things it's multifaceted as

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
every as that

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,360
and then it's also multi-disciplinary

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
because you know there are different

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
areas like social engineering where

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
you're dealing with people there's the

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
penetration testing side and there's all

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000
the different aspects that you can learn

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,480
in cyber security it is an ever evolving

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
field where you're always learning and

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,599
developing new skills

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,280
and not only that right

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
with the development of digital

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
technology there's always new things

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,959
that you need to be worried about or you

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,400
need to be concerned with in cyber

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,879
security you know just again 20 years

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,040
ago iot or internet of things wasn't

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
such a thing your alexa and your uh and

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,760
all these different tools would not be

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,120
of security consent until today right so

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
therefore cyber security is really fun

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
and always evolving and learning is very

91
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,560
much at the core of this so if you're

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
interested in learning and growing and

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,159

world and more importantly they are the

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,400
providers of cyber security education

171
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,360
for the top i.t college in their home

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
country john bryce

173
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,479
furthermore they also do a lot of the

174
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,600
local

175
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,400
training

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,199
for all their internal home countries

177
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,000
services which is why you know if you

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
know about their home country and you

179
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,199
know how good they are at cyber security

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
you know that the quality of education

181
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,840
for them to get in there is very high

182
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
and this is why we're excited to work

183
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
with them and this is why we're able to

184
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,960
share with you how much we've learned on

185
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,840
the ground

186
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,440
let's start with the common questions

187
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,240
that we are always asked at cfc right

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,400
whenever we have run our info sessions

189
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,080
you know when people are interested in

190
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,000
entering cyber security as a career we

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
get these questions do i need an i.t

192
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,400
background do i need to know coding

193
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
the answer is very simply no you can

194
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
have zero knowledge

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,720
before you take these seven steps

196
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,919
now it's really important for you to

197
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,199
realize that it is perfectly fine for

198
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,560
you to not have an i.t background or any

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
coding knowledge before you embark on

200
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
this journey this is exactly why cfc is

201
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
created is to be able to help you be

202
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
able to have

203
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
a career in cyber security by training

204
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,919
you in the different areas but that's us

205
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,840
the seven steps will also cover all the

206
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
different areas you need to learn if you

207
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
were to take it on your own such that

208
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
you don't need an id background or

209
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
coding to take these seven steps

210
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
another question that people ask very

211
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
often is is it mentally challenging

212
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,960
well

213
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
any career that is exciting and

214
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
lucrative and gonna give you a very good

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,080
career stability will be mentally

216
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,639
challenging but if you think about dairy

217
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,160
i wouldn't say so if you are enjoying

218
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
the process if you like digital systems

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
if you care about cyber security it is

220
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
definitely not something that will drain

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
a lot of you it's actually fun a lot of

222
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
people who are in the field will be

223
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,759
happily talking about all the different

224
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,520
things they learned and all the practice

225
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,479
of it and why you're here in cinco 2021

226
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,879
is because all these people love talking

227
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,520
about it so it's not very but it is

228
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
mentally challenging

229
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
and

230
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
if you're interested in understanding a

231
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,479
bit more as to whether you're ever too

232
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,479
old for a cyber security we have people

233
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,759
in their 40s in their 30s in our classes

234
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,680
right they are looking for a career

235
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,080
switch it's never too late and even in

236
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,919
your 50s and 60 if you're truly

237
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,280
interested and you whatever you want to

238
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,080
learn

239
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
the knowledge of cyber security can

240
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
bring you into a lot of different new

241
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
aspects in terms of your career if you

242
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,080
were to choose to do so right

243
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,159
we recommend that you just learn more

244
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,679
about it first and decide along the way

245
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,519
especially after you've gone through

246
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,880
what we are talking about today the

247
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
seven steps so let's talk about the

248
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,519
first step find your reason to join

249
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,440
cyber security we'll talk about this i'm

250
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,959
going to give you the practical reasons

251
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
as to why you should join cyber security

252
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
but of course there's a lot of emotional

253
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,519
reasons like why i just shared with you

254
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,519
which is why i love it right

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,240
let's talk about the career trajectory

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,560
cyber security is a very clear and very

257
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
lucrative career for you to be in why

258
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,240
because

259
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
as the reports say you know we're

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,800
looking at two million unfor until

261
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,279
positions in the next 10 years we're

262
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,000
talking about a general deficit in terms

263
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
of people being able to fulfill the

264
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
ranks of cyber security it is a sunrise

265
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,640
industry it is always growing right and

266
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,399
the other part is it is important to

267
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,480
note that the beginning right the entry

268
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,040
point is between 3 to 5k a month in

269
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
singapore right now

270
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,200
so what we're looking at is a starting

271
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
pay of between 36 to 58 000

272
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,279
a year now these are really good numbers

273
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,839
for entry level and if you were to rise

274
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,440
through the ranks in the next two to

275
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
five years five to eight years you're

276
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,399
looking at 100 to 200 000 or even up to

277
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,760
300 000

278
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,600
a year if you build your career right

279
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
cyber security is a field that is always

280
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,880
growing and will always need more people

281
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
in the higher ranks it is definitely

282
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
also a skills-based career which also

283
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,040
means that once you upgrade your skills

284
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
it is more possible for you to rise

285
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,839
through the ranks

286
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
and how do you prove it

287
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,519
it's always by skills right you need to

288
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,440
showcase your skills

289
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
so what do you do in cyber security

290
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
includes incentives response penetration

291
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
testing so let's go into a little bit

292
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,079
more detail about what you're doing in

293
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,760
there incidental response you're

294
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,079
basically functioning much like the

295
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,399
person who's patrolling the areas making

296
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,959
sure and responding to all the different

297
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,320
attacks that's happening within the

298
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
systems and what you're doing is very

299
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,560
much a lot like protecting your country

300
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
or protecting your systems or protecting

301
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,959
your home it's all about being able to

302
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,839
defend and observe what's going on

303
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,480
penetration testing is all about being

304
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,399
the person who is whitehead hacking

305
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,240
right like you're testing the systems

306
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
you're breaking systems you're regularly

307
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,920
testing what's going on in there if

308
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
you're into spying movies this is

309
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
necessity for you if you're into defense

310
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
if you're into stability if you're into

311
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
regularity

312
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
incidence response brings enough

313
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,079
engagement in terms of excitement

314
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
because every time an attack happens you

315
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,800
need to do

316
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,399
certain things to prevent things from

317
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,519
happening

318
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,959
but most of the time you're actually

319
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,440
doing a 9-5 job it's very stable

320
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
it's good for you vulnerability

321
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,959
assessments are basically people

322
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
internal to a company who are regularly

323
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,279
testing the vulnerabilities of their

324
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,839
servers the systems they're regularly

325
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,600
running code checks all these different

326
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
things to be able to make sure that

327
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
things are working it is a little bit

328
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
close to what penetration testers do but

329
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
on the internal side

330
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
if you're into csi forensic

331
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
investigation is definitely for you

332
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
right if you like cyber and csi this is

333
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,320
a space where you're tracking down

334
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,839
finding out what actually happened when

335
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,519
an attack has happened you're doing a

336
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,680
post-mortem you're trying to figure out

337
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
what exactly happened it's a really fun

338
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,720
career to have

339
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
or if you're more of a business person

340
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
you like dealing with people governance

341
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,680
risk is definitely for you you're coming

342
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,440
out of privacy policies for companies

343
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
you're managing all the cyber awareness

344
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
you're dealing with all the policy level

345
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,360
work in the company

346
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,519
now if you're into threat hunting three

347
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,040
hunting is very much about you

348
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
researching what are the latest threats

349
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
who are the ransomware groups who are

350
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,399
the hackers who are the people likely to

351
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,000
attack your company or your

352
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,079
organizational body that you pre you

353
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,839
protect threat i think is very much

354
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,560
about you know the practice of

355
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,360
you know

356
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,720
observing and knowing who are the

357
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
different threats and then being able to

358
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,160
give good reports about it as well as to

359
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
prevent

360
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
potential future attacks through these

361
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
measures

362
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,000
development security operations or

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,320
devsecops is the process of being a

364
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,160
software engineer who focuses on the

365
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
security of the software that they

366
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,800
develop

367
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,560
now this are really great careers to

368
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,920
have if you're interested in all these

369
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
different areas but more importantly

370
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
after this if you're interested in cyber

371
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,920
security you could still be in cyber

372
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,720
security but in marketing in sales in

373
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,959
the business aspects because all these

374
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
different areas still need people who

375
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,040
know cyber security but are interested

376
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,440
in all the other non-practice rules

377
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,680
so why we think people should join cyber

378
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,600
security very simple

379
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
it is easy to find a job if you are

380
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
qualified if you're good enough once you

381
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,279
enter cyber security it is actually very

382
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,440
possible you find a job

383
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,279
it is high pay there's clear career

384
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,680
progression it is long-term job security

385
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
and it's very possible for you to jump

386
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,399
into other areas thereafter

387
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,639
now why do we even have this talk it's

388
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,600
because

389
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,959
it is hard for you to enter cyber

390
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,480
security because hiring managers

391
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
wouldn't hire you unless you have the

392
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,040
skills

393
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,480
how will you even showcase you have the

394
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
skills get the interview be able to

395
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
prove that you can get a job in cyber

396
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,360
security

397
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,079
this is why it's hard in the first place

398
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,920
the skills that is required is not

399
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
something that's typically taught in

400
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
schools and needs specialized education

401
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
which is why for most people it is hard

402
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,279
for you to enter you need to know how

403
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,120
linux runs you need to know how networks

404
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
are set up you need to know how to run

405
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
your os systems you need to work with

406
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
virtual machines how many of us do that

407
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
on a daily level

408
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,120
which is why it's hard and even if you

409
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,279
were to get the low level certs it

410
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,279
doesn't necessarily get you a job

411
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,279
because a lot of this search are theory

412
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,440
based and once you get to the interview

413
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,040
phase they might ask you a bunch of

414
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
questions that you might not be able to

415
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
answer and that actually causes you to

416
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
lose the opportunities which is why it's

417
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
hard to get in because

418
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,240
it is a skills-based career and you need

419
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,079
to show your skills

420
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,240
cyber security hires based on trust

421
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,920
skills and knowledge which is why sing

422
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,160
con 2021 for example is really great

423
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,079
because it's all about sharing skills

424
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
sharing knowledge and hopefully build

425
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,519
you up to have a career in cyber

426
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,279
security

427
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,399
so

428
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,959
let's now that we know why you should

429
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
enter cyber security and you know why is

430
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,199
it hard to enter why you know there's a

431
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,079
moat around the career that you have

432
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,720
let's go into what is the next step

433
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,199
start learning cyber security

434
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,560
when i talk about this we're not going

435
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,680
to leave you in the ledge and just tell

436
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,160
you just go study cyber security no no

437
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,839
here are great resources you can have

438
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,519
they're great websites like try hack me

439
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,000
it's a great beginner-friendly website

440
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,760
and if you're a little bit more advanced

441
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
go further the cyber mentor academy

442
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
hector box academy these great places

443

are great for you to learn higher and

444
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,880
higher knowledge levels

445
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,560
and it is really great resources right

446
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,600
if you're interested in penetration

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,920
you what's happening what is actually

452
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
happening on the ground

453
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,759
and train you in what people do so that

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,920
about the mentality around it the great

457
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,399
books to read and here comes my favorite

458
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,720
resource youtube channels now this list

459
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,800
of youtube channels are wonderful for

460
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,120
you to get your toes wet into

461
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
understanding a little bit more about

462
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
cyber security as well as to take the

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,839
tutorials for you to gain the first few

464
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,759
steps into cyber security

465
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,399
now we'll leave this whole slide and

466
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,040
everything in the discord channel after

467
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,839
this talk but please just stay with me

468
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,000
we'll go through all seven steps before

469
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,560
we share with you

470
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
before we go further into the steps we

471
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
need to understand what cyber security

472
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,120
is

473
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
now you as a normal person as a person

474
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,560
who's not in cyber security yet

475
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,600
actually

476
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,240
understanding what it is is really key

477
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
it is the practice of protecting systems

478
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
networks devices and programs for

479
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,240
digital attacks a lot of ways in which

480
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,079
cyber security is done is actually

481
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,399
through your passwords the user access

482
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,240
who gets access to your computer right

483
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
you give your password away right easily

484
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,680
the fact that you have to log in into

485
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,320
your os or your operating system it's

486
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
really important who gets access to your

487
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,720
wi-fi networks what kind of vpn do you

488
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,759
run

489
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,440
two-factor authentication all the

490
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,199
different softwares when you log into

491
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,120
your instagram the passwords the

492
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,959
security the tickets that you use all

493
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,800
these different things are really part

494
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,519
of cyber security

495
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,000
now on this end it seems foreign to us

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,399
as to how it's implemented and what it

497
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,440
does

498
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,679
naturally but it is really important for

499
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,599
you to know that almost every single

500
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,599
digital experience that you have

501
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
has cyber security built into it which

502
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,919
is why recognizing this is really

503
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,199
important

504
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,199
knowing how this works helps you

505
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,319
understand more about cyber security

506
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,480
now to enter cyber security you need

507
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,359
these three fundamental core parts

508
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,280
networking linux and windows when you

509
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,039
talk about this i'm talking about

510
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,440
understanding the operation operating

511
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,320
systems linux and windows as well as how

512
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,679
internet works for example how do you

513
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,520
actually receive this information on

514
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
your computer right now through the

515
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,320
internet

516
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,440
is networking right all this packet sent

517
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,559
across

518
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,799
the different lines

519
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,440
the fiber cables in our ground under

520
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
seat these are really important things

521
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
for you to know about

522
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
if you want to understand more about

523
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,559
cyber security you need the fundamentals

524
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,120
in networking before you can go further

525
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,360
more software's in cyber security are

526
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,400
built for linux and knowing how to use

527
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,559
it as well as knowing how to manage the

528
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,039
servers which are you know the mainstay

529
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,640
in networks

530
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
because of the wonderful operating

531
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
system that it

532
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,760
it it maintains long up times there are

533
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
wonderful things about it a lot of tools

534
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,720
are also built on it you need to

535
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
understand linux to be able to

536
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,720
be in cyber security

537
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
and most companies use windows which is

538
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,960
why windows is a very essential part of

539
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,200
learning cyber security because a lot of

540
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,039
attacks actually happen on windows

541
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
machines which is why it is important

542
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
for you to understand this

543
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
now that we've done that let's talk

544
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,840
about virtual machines

545
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,679
virtual machines are

546
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,360
very very important parts of your

547
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,520
learning process if you don't experiment

548
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,799
with virtual machines it's very hard for

549
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,840
you to do

550
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,760
anything in cyber security now let's

551
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,120
even talk about what virtual machines

552
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,600
are they are basically guest

553
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
operating systems on your computer that

554
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,240
you can run without having to run them

555
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
on your computer itself which means that

556
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,240
i can run a linux a mac or a windows in

557
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,960
my

558
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,520
computer itself that is under my

559
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,640
computer

560
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
the great part about this is that you

561
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,760
get to really learn about how the

562
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,120
network works because you'll be building

563
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,480
networks within the virtual machine

564
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,679
systems but more importantly you have to

565
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,720
be able to learn how to manage all these

566
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,880
different things you get to break then

567
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
os

568
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
and then recover from it rather than

569
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,120
having to reinstall it on your computer

570
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
all over again it is all about the

571
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,440
ability to learn thanks to virtual

572
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,120
machines

573
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
so once you know how to create your own

574
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,559
servers and networks you know you know

575
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,400
how to use the tools that are used in

576
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
linux like for myself i have a kali

577
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,559
linux running on my windows machine that

578
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,480
is really important because a lot of the

579
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,000
different learnings that we're having

580
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
are done on linux systems on the kali

581
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
linux right you get hands-on practice

582
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,480
and emulation of real-world events and

583
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
it that allows you to understand the

584
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
tools of the trade

585
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
and once you simulate attacks and you

586
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
simulate all kinds of defense systems

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,640
you get to observe how everything is

588
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,799
done the impact of everything so that

589
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,520
you can present this to the future

590
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,640
employers

591
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,480
and it's a really great space for

592
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,840
experimentation

593
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,200
another very important part of virtual

594
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
machines in cyber security is that it's

595
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,440
absolutely for security for example if i

596
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
were to download a virus or a trojan or

597
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,600
a or a worm

598
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,200
also known as malware

599
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,919
you can open it up without any fears of

600
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,320
your own computer being jeopardized

601
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,799
secondly there's no permanent damage on

602
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,320
your host operating system meaning the

603
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,080
ones that install onto your computer

604
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,600
itself

605
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,559
so that you don't have to worry or have

606
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,559
to reinstall everything and wipe your

607
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,000
whole hard disk and lose all the

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
precious information when you run on

609
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,280
guest systems the great part is you can

610
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
always take snapshots you can

611
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
close and open and delete all of them

612
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,760
it's wonderful and then last but not

613
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,640
least you can encrypt whole oss so that

614
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
you don't have to worry about other

615
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
people accessing them so especially when

616
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
you're doing cyber security a lot of

617
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,400
information might be private and keeping

618
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
it away from other people is really key

619
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,520
that's why encryption is very important

620
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
now that we've gone in here let me share

621
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
with you that if you're interested

622
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,200
download works vmware workstation

623
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,159
player

624
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,240
or virtualbox for you to start

625
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,480
experimenting start downloading some oss

626
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,559
so you get to experience what's it like

627
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,679
and start playing around with the

628
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,720
systems

629
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,320
the websites that we recommended will

630
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,919
start telling you a bit more what kind

631
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,280
of things you can do on them and give

632
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,799
you a good idea of what you can do step

633
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,600
four

634
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
join capture the flags join the

635
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
communities and conferences you know

636
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,960
join capture the flag competitions

637
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,240
together to understand what's happening

638
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,760
actually happening i learned a lot from

639
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,679
my first two rounds of joining cts and

640
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,960
it gave me a very good understanding of

641
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,640
what are the different skills needed in

642
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,559
cyber security and one of the most

643
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,240
important parts about this is joining

644
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,000
communities now in singapore we have

645
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,679
this wonderful group called division

646
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,240
zero or div zero there is singapore's

647
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,919
largest cyber security community that

648
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,240
shares knowledge and information for the

649
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,200
meetups

650
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,799
joining it will really be something

651
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,320
beneficial for you because you get to

652
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
meet potential future employers of

653
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
potential future colleagues that would

654
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
know more about your skills if you were

655
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,760
to be joining these sessions

656
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
of course sync content e31 is a great

657
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
space to be and if you're in the startup

658
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,240
industry ice 71 or i71 is great space

659
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,320
for you because they are startup focused

660
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
cyber security group there's a great

661
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
community for you to connect with and if

662
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,080
you're interested in more information

663
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,679
you know singapore computer society

664
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,919
cyber security chapter our aisp also

665
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,159
known as association of information

666
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,400
security professionals are great spaces

667
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,120
for you to learn more about all the

668
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,200
different workshops and all the

669
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,720
different tools that you might need

670
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,200
because they run regular sessions

671
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,600
step five create your github and

672
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,840
portfolio now this is a very important

673
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,919
part how do you showcase your skills to

674
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,159
your potential employer if you do not

675
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,720
have a portfolio of online this is where

676
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
github comes in now if you're a software

677
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,159
engineer you probably know github

678
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,320
already but if you're not github is the

679
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
space where people

680
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,880
upload

681
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,159
codes and all this kind of different

682
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,400
things such that people can share it and

683
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,720
be able to showcase so a lot of open

684
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,440
source software is on github and if you

685
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
share it on there you can use it as your

686
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,559
portfolio

687
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
just to give you a bit of ideas there

688
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,840
are shell scripts and python scripts

689
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,679
that we recommend people to upload so

690
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,520
that people can know that you know your

691
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,760
skills shell scripts are basically the

692
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,679
thing that is run on linux to be able to

693
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,520
run all the different commands on an

694
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,760
automated level if you can showcase your

695
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,679
sales skips abilities it gives people

696
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,120
the confidence that you know linux

697
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,360
systems for you to run python scripts

698
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,120
really shows your ability at least on

699
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,799
coding level as well as some of the

700
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,360
basics level of how do you run security

701
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
or offense operations

702
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,760
in python code and this allows you to

703
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,600
showcase your defense and offense skills

704
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,000
for your potential employers

705
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,840
so remember to get ready these things

706
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,279
github

707
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,200
a website so this you can get it off

708
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,720
namecheap or godaddy and use a wix to be

709
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,600
able to run your own website for free

710
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,360
right so this is really important once

711
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,559
you have a website you know how to

712
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,640
relink everything once you have set this

713
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,799
all up you're setting up a wonderful

714
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,480
system for people to know more about

715
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,840
yourself

716
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,279
of course that's where you put up

717
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,960
projects that you take on which i'll

718
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,400
explain a bit more later on and the

719
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
different reports that you create as uh

720
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,400
as a result now step six do cyber

721
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,840
security projects now this can be done

722
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,240
on hector box try hack me or you can do

723
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,559
paid work or unpaid work for companies

724
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,240
or friends or in your own virtual

725
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,320
machines for you to showcase now it's

726
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,760
really important that you document the

727
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,840
whole process of doing a vulnerability

728
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
assessment you can run through it on

729
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,279
your virtual machines

730
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,279
in a fake environment we mean you know

731
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,960
you're not actually changing it on real

732
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
people's servers but at least you

733
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,360
showcase that you can do it and you can

734
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,279
run what's going on

735
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,799
a penetration test can be done in the

736
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
same way or you can do it you know for a

737
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,799
friend's company or for somebody who's

738
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,159
willing to let you try out on their

739
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,919
system

740
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,760
third and fourth would be setting up

741
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
security systems or basic security

742
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
operations where you can run an attack

743
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,000
show how you defended against it show

744
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,360
how you detected all the different

745
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,039
things or even how you set up all the

746
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,559
defense procedures

747
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,600
for the systems

748
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,400
when you

749
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,159
actually document all these things

750
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,279
people know that you know the

751
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,720
step-by-step approach

752
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,039
how you think your methodologies they

753
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,960
are more confident of being able to hire

754
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,679
you to do the work

755
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,600
and of course step seven is to showcase

756
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,520
your abilities thereafter right you

757
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,679
don't do all this to keep it in

758
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,360
somewhere where nobody can see it

759
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
showcase your skills you can do this

760
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
either as a website and showcase it

761
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,360
through the interview process or sending

762
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,400
it in your cv you can also start taking

763
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,200
you know

764
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,760
going on ctfs capture the flags and

765
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,600
showing that you know your stuff by you

766
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,000
know getting a certain position or

767
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,520
even going for higher level search if

768
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,279
you actually are confident enough but

769
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,760
what we recommend is definitely to start

770
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
talking to people in div zero to in sync

771
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,200
2021 to start talking to people to get

772
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,279
their feedback about what you're doing

773
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,960
and to see what they say about your

774
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,880
capabilities so that you know how to

775
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,720
better showcase it when you're going to

776
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,559
