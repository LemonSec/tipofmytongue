1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,639
hello my name is ron hing i'm the

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,120
regional head for asia for private sect

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,879
a leading cyber governance and security

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,160
partner

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,440
and today i'd like to talk about the

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,480
evolving role of a cso

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,320
so arguably there's never been a better

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
or worse time to be a cso cyber threats

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,080
have moved to the forefront of people's

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
minds it appears regularly in news media

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,480
and in popular culture

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,480
and as we can see the discussion of

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,160
cyber security has been growing outside

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,599
of what is considered traditional

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,080
domains it's becoming a talking point

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,760
especially in product differentiation

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,280
and even coming up in sales and

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
partnership conversations

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
as the industry continues to mature

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,800
organizations gain a better

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,239
understanding on how cyber rates should

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,600
be managed

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,160
and all we often hear the term security

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,480
is an organizational responsibility

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
it's gradually actually being reflected

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,559
in how responsibility and ownership of

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,559
cyber security related issues has been

28
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,038
evolving

29
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,559
now cisos face uphill battles

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,879
this is represented by a statistic where

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,879
we have found that for the only 40

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,080
percent of interviewed professionals see

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,720
cso as c-suite position and this comes

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
from a hbr analytics services survey

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
from 2019.

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,439
now the reasons why cso face uphill

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,119
battles can be broken down to three main

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,080
points

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
the first being infosec

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,840
compartmentalization

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,320
so infosec tends to be viewed only as an

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,479
id function

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,680
now in the survey by f5 we found that 58

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,079
of respondents found that id security is

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
a standalone function and not integrated

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,000
with other business functions

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
now as a consequence these companies do

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
not have a id security strategy that

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,119
spends their time the price

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,680
next organizational hierarchy

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
so the cso often sits under the cio or

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
the cto instead of being an equal

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
c-suite officer

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
now that's it the cso rule is somewhat

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,560
special

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,079
nobody asks what the cso's

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
responsibilities are when you hear the

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
title

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
but being a truly horizontal function

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
that affect other this other areas of

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,960
the business means that defining the

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,399
role correctly is critical to the

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,440
success of organization

64
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
the nature of security

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
now business is about streamlining be it

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,599
and

67
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,599
ensuring better availability of systems

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,840
be it in ensuring better usability of an

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
application by customers

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
on making a decision to outsource

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
functions within organization

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,599
now security is a part to play in all of

73
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,760
these but the cso often would have

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
different objectives from the decision

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,319
makers

76
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,640
so what are the implications of this

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,319
now cisos will need to balance and

78
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,000
address different limitations and needs

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,760
for each department

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
and we can see why particular reporting

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,360
lines would hinder this impartiality

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
so 75 percent of respondents from a 2017

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,959
survey the same f5 survey

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,200
say that due to lack of integration turf

85
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,760
and silo issues have been a challenge

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,840
and influence id security tactics and

87
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,360
strategies now the lack of cooperation

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,159
between csos and departments which view

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
security as a hindrance instead of a

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,840
business necessity

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,959
would cause these blockers

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,239
in the hbr survey they found that 84

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
percent has considered

94
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,159
um the ability to educate and

95
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,920
collaborate across businesses to be very

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,599
important in the cso

97
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,360
so it makes it one of the

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
one of the most important skills i'm

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,799
covered in the survey that's been

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,640
highlighted

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
and from the facts of what the cso will

102
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
need to balance within an organization

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,239
and we need to communicate and champion

104
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,959
for we can see that this is true

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,959
now of course that's it the context of

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,200
the organization matters how much

107
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
influence is needed within id related to

108
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,599
id systems and data

109
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,599
as well as outside of the id

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,799
department

111
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,799
and how practical are technical only

112
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,959
solutions so sitting within the id

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
department brings about some benefits in

114
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,120
terms of the cso's ability to influence

115
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
decisions made there

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,280
but depending on organizations seeing

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
that it's a horizontal function and

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,720
affects other business functions

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,159
sitting outside of id would bring about

120
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,160
positive influences from that point of

121
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,400
view

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,560
so what is the resolution to this

123
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
now the cso

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,960
would

125
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,440
in an ideal scenario be in a standalone

126
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080
not no conflict rule possibly reporting

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,800
directly to the ceo

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,240
now we have seen

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
we have seen others thinking along the

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
same lines

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,479
so in israel's privacy protection act

132
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,160
they actually highlight that the cso

133
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,759
needs to be in this standalone position

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,840
the other way to ensure this happens is

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
to highlight the csos rule

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
have and its influence on other aspects

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
of the business

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
such as maintaining brand and image as

139
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,000
opposed to just simply

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,320
thinking about id and data assets but

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
instead enabling the business and

142
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
playing a higher profile more strategic

143
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
role

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
and getting others to understand that

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,919
the influence of the cso can be felt

146
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,199
widely to the organization beyond id

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,600
integrating the cso function with all

148
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
relevant departments to provide the

149
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,320
overall picture was unable to see so

150
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
to give a more holistic

151
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,919
security strategy data to suit

152
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,400
individual department requirements

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
and by focusing on the role as well as

154
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,479
the messaging around this role on

155
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,039
enabling the business instead of

156
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,720
just focusing on management and

157
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,120
implementation of specific controls such

158
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,039
as protecting endpoints

159
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,919
and parameter defense for example

160
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,840
this would allow the cso to be

161
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
successful

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
now i hope this session has been helpful

163
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
and i know that this topic has been

164
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,479
brought up repeatedly over the last few

165
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,759
years but as we see cyber security

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680
as an industry continue to mature and

167
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
more recognizing the need for cyber

168
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
security

169
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,319
i'm pretty sure this conversation will

170
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,080
come up again

171
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,199
thanks for your time
