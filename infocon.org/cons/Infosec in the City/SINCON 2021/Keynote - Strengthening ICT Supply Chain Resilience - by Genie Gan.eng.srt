1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,559
first up for the opening keynote of

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,400
synchon 2021 please welcome jeannie gunn

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,480
head of government relations and public

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
affairs of apec at kaspersky

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,359
a very good morning to everyone and it's

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,359
a pleasure to speak to you today for

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
more than two decades and counting we at

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,320
kaspersky have been monitoring the

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,840
latest trends in cyberspace and refining

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,120
our solutions to mitigate the risks

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,520
we all know that

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
cyber attacks have grown in prevalence

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,079
and sophistication

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,320
the good news is that governments and

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,239
enterprises across the asia pacific

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,239
region have been shoring up their cyber

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,399
defenses amidst the recent spate of

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,399
cyber attacks

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,399
the bad news however is that cyber

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,399
criminals are not letting up and they

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,520
are

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,000
highly skilled and capitalizing on the

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
vulnerabilities in our systems and will

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,199
only get better

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,840
who will win the fight

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
is to be determined but one thing is

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,479
certain we still have a long way to go

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,640
of growing concern today is the security

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,360
of our ict supply chains where the

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,880
european union

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,680
for cyber security estimates a four-fold

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
growth in ict supply chain and cyber

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,759
attacks this year

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,400
compared to 2020

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,520
you may be familiar with not petya

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360
wannacry

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,479
shadow pad and most recently sunburst

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,560
the malware that breached an american

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
software company and used it as a

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,640
conduit to infiltrate nine u.s federal

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,880
agencies including the office of

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
of the president

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,759
and the treasury and commerce

44
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,079
departments

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,960
many more companies who also compromised

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,600
as a result

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,560
our ict systems have been more connected

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
than ever before but this also presents

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
opportunities for cyber criminals to

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,239
move up the ict supply chain

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,840
to

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
to attack software vendors or i.t

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
services

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
companies with the intent

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,680
to

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
compromise their clients through a back

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,599
door

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,280
once through hackers can conduct cyber

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
espionage

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,239
mine data

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,720
or extort money

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,599
by releasing ransomware

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,840
for instance earlier this year hackers

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,560
breached a different american software

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,160
company and in turn infected hundreds of

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
its clients

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
with ransomware

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
in exchange for the decryption key

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
smaller companies were made to pay fifty

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,840
thousand dollars and larger companies

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,159
five million dollars

72
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,560
and of course individuals like you like

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,879
me were not spared either

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,480
stores like the swedish grocery chain

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
coupe

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
were forced to close their 500

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
supermarkets

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
after the same hack not the cash

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,360
registers offline

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,840
so what is the way forward with the

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
scale

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,680
of the impact and the range of

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
stakeholders involved who is responsible

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,120
for the cyber security of our supply

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
chains

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,280
the answer is simple

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
it is you

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
it is me it is it is everyone

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,640
for one the global nature of cyber

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,760
chains necessitates a coordinated global

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,959
response

92
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
there is an urgent need to align on

93
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,879
rules on norms for cyber chain risk

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,360
detection management and response for

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
every sector

96
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,239
at a multilateral level global platforms

97
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,959
such as the un's internet governance

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
forum are a good start

99
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,280
just last year

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
kaspersky together with the east west

101
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,840
institute ministry of communications

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
information and technology of kenya and

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,159
the association of users of information

104
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,120
systems of morocco led a workshop to

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,440
discuss ways to develop transparency in

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,639
global ict supply chains

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,520
at a bilateral level countries like

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,639
singapore

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
and the u.s have an mou on cyber

110
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,840
security cooperation which includes

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,240
information sharing and ex

112
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
and and expert joint exercises

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
companies must also take responsibility

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
for these things right it should be

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
untenable

116
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
it would be in fact untenable and

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,759
inefficient for a company to audit

118
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,360
the network security of all its software

119
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,600
vendors and partners or rely on the

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
government for that matter

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,560
one solution is for businesses to

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,280
develop special agreements with the

123
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
partners and suppliers who share

124
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,199
resources and data

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,400
79

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
of enterprises already do so today

127
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,919
but beyond such agreements we believe

128
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,160
that accountability should be a

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,160
fundamental principle for all businesses

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,520
and this underpins kaspersky's global

131
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,759
transparency initiative

132
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,880
where we

133
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
welcome

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
people to

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,479
government partners regulators

136
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,800
enterprises

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
partners to review our source code at

138
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
our transparency centers with five

139
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840
across the globe and counting

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
for those who may not know how to do so

141
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,080
or what to look out for exactly

142
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
in the process of reviewing source codes

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
we even go so far as to teach people how

144
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
to evaluate product security through our

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
cyber capacity building program

146
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,120
i'm happy to share that governments

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
across asia pacific and the world have

148
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,039
already undergone that training provided

149
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
by kaspersky and have given us good

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
reviews

151
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
together with first

152
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
a global network of government and

153
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
private sects which kaspersky is

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,479
privileged to be a member of we have

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
also published our ethical principles

156
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
for responsible vulnerability disclosure

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,880
which

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,280
anyone can access freely online

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
recently we also went one step further

160
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,960
to provide a list of software components

161
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,680
known as the software build of materials

162
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,479
to help our patents better understanding

163
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,000
to get a better understanding of what's

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,919
inside our products and software

165
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,680
architecture and hopefully provide

166
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,039
assurance

167
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,880
in the security and integrity of our

168
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
solutions

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,240
i do hope that we will collectively keep

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
up this momentum and that governments

171
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
industry and individuals can come

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,639
together to plug the gaps in our ict

173
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,440
supply chains by enhancing our

174
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,599
collective baseline level of cyber

175
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
