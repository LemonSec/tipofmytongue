1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
my name is neil pambier

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,520
i am uh the business development leader

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,600
for cyber security here at microfocus so

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,839
cyber race is a line of business for us

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,719
here at uh microfocus so my topic is on

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,000
shift left and one of the things that i

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,519
want to highlight is shift left was a

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
term coined mainly by the devsecops

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,480
community

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,240
and one of the things that we observed

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,920
about shift left was it was trying to

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
drive efficiency in a number of areas a

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,960
lot of it was to do with testing but

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,640
security vulnerabilities also came into

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,920
place as well application security

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,160
testing we observed what was happening

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,238
with the shift left philosophy and we

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,480
observed quite a few interesting metrics

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,920
we improved the security we reduced

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,960
false positives we introduced a lot of

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,399
business partnerships between security

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,079
teams and developers which which existed

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
as a gap for a very long time so we

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,719
looked at the shift left uh

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,559
kind of messaging and we looked at how

26
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,199
this applies to csos in today's world so

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
my topic is mainly going to be about

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,399
this today

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,840
so let's start with what we've been

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,079
observing over the last number of the

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,359
last four decades when we look at

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,520
security first the last two decades

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,199
security started off as a compliance

34
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,199
requirement many of you remember about

35
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,840
sarbanes-oxley uh pci dss was part of

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
the framework here as well and then gdpr

37
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
and then the privacy came it came along

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,280
much much more later but it was mainly

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,119
focusing on compliance we looked at

40
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,880
security as a requirement to address

41
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,119
compliance we looked at

42
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,880
look from looking at our compliance

43
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
posture we moved into how do we de-risk

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
the business with with the um with the

45
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,600
risk that we've seen from the lack of

46
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
compliance we looked at how we enable

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the business and there was a big push

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,759
for the digital transformation at this

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,560
stage between 2014 and 2020. many of you

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,200
will know that we try to transform

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
digitally and there was a lot of

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
resistance from the business which was

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
largely due to the businesses weren't

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
ready then enterprise became very very

55
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
ready because of the covered pandemic

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,119
that we saw so this area is very much

57
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,680
about how resilient are we a great

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,280
opportunity for us to be working in

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,119
security when we look at

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,600
how how much we've accelerated the

61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,520
cross to the digital uh fault line

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,439
let's look at a bit more about the

63
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,560
traditional models that we've seen exist

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,479
in our security framework for the last

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,400
few years so we've always looked at the

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
risk management securing the business

67
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,520
and also how we move towards uh reducing

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
exposure as well this has been the main

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
focus and when we look at all the cyber

70
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,640
services that are listed on the

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
left-hand side you'll be very familiar

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
with you know whether it was about erp

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,160
systems whether it was patching whether

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,239
it was partner integration whether it

75
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,239
was uh incident management whether it

76
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
was security instant event management

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
and so on

78
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
infrastructure security cloud adoption

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
this is very much about how much are we

80
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
managing risk securing our business and

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
reducing exposure

82
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,920
when we look at the approach today and

83
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
largely due to how we've transformed

84
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
digitally the shift has become more

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
about enabling the business and also

86
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
establishing trust

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
trust across all those services that we

88
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,599
have that represent our cyber security

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,080
portfolio and posture as well so the

90
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,640
shift left is is is more about

91
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
understanding where the business is and

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,159
where we need to prioritize with our

93
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,480
security investments and security focus

94
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,159
as well

95
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,560
when we look at the shift left leader

96
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,159
today um

97
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,920
there's a number five there's five key

98
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
areas that the the new leader works

99
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,760
looks and focuses on

100
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,599
business aligned really aligned with

101
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,319
what business services are required to

102
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,920
make sure that the business is resilient

103
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,760
and can function on a day-to-day basis

104
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,599
so we prioritize on what services and

105
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,480
applications are key to our business

106
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,319
modernity a very important thing we need

107
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,239
to be critically thinking about where we

108
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
are where we are positioned today and

109
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
where we where we will land in the

110
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
future as well a very strong rationale

111
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
and very measured against our business

112
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
outcomes having empathy for our

113
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
organizations and empathy is something

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,799
that we learned from from our devsecops

115
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,280
shift left methodology where we saw that

116
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
there was a uh we set ourselves very

117
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,840
high expectations and we failed to

118
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
deliver on those expectations because

119
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
the security teams weren't really well

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
aligned to the development teams in that

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,319
scenario so the need to have empathy

122
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,799
transparency and also this is decision

123
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,000
ownership as well who in my

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,439
organizations

125
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,959
owns the key decisions in this

126
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,400
particular area

127
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
when we look at when we look at the

128
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,560
shift left with devsecops people were a

129
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,478
key part of this we found that the

130
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,320
developer team weren't so familiar with

131
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
security and the security teams didn't

132
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
really understand what the development

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,720
teams were exposed to so the the key

134
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
understanding of what the what role

135
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,479
people play in our

136
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
shift left leadership program is very

137
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,880
very important so we we look at the

138
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
survey service oriented leadership by

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,280
decision ownership between business and

140
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,199
technical teams and having trust and

141
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
transparency

142
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
the way we measure performance is very

143
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
key to us because we traditionally what

144
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
we've done is we've looked at slas we've

145
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,800
looked at um

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
vulnerability assessments we've looked

147
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,720
at how well we've measured those uh

148
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
and mitigated those risks but now we

149
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
want to also look at other areas

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
communication and weaknesses throughout

151
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,639
my organization how do we communicate

152
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,680
how resilient we are and how do we

153
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,240
communicate

154
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,199
uh areas that we have been impacted in

155
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
and driving readiness as well how ready

156
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,000
are we a key a key kpi to communicate to

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
my organization

158
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
also um what we've seen today that the

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
new shift lift shift left leader doesn't

160
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
go alone they bring together

161
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,639
technical expertise they bring together

162
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
their business and peers and partners

163
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
and also contributes to the general

164
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
awareness of what cyber security means

165
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,039
to my organization

166
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,360
the shift left mission is very very

167
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
strategic it's a very very much a

168
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,560
digital multiplier uh has agility at the

169
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
heart of it and speak to market so we we

170
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
know that we want to

171
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,479
be very responsive to how the market is

172
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,160
changing and the last 18 months has

173
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,560
shown us how the market can change very

174
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
very quickly and how we can respond to a

175
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
pandemic so

176
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
having innovation at the heart now if we

177
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
don't have some of this vision and some

178
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
of these processes placed it's very very

179
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
difficult for us to drive innovation and

180
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
innovation is going to be very key to

181
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
how resilient we are and having security

182
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
at the heart of that new channels

183
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
markets trust and confidence in terms of

184
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
cyber priorities is to reduce the

185
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
business friction having key advisors in

186
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
my within my business community and

187
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
partnerships to help me drive

188
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
initiatives and innovation as well trust

189
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
and confidence in decision making so we

190
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
we partner with our business partners to

191
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,199
understand where the market focuses

192
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,039
where is the business focus for us where

193
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,800
are we going to have

194
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
the greatest resiliency or where we

195
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
where do we need to have the great

196
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,319
greatest resiliency

197
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,080
enabled agility and resiliency at the

198
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,319
heart of our organization some of the

199
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,639
mission accelerators smart factories

200
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,960
industry 4.0 wearables iot 3d printing

201
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
robotics advanced analytics is a key

202
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
area that we look at microfocus and how

203
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,039
we can use that to help enable

204
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
resiliency in our business

205
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,199
um everything in cloud and understanding

206
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
how hybrid cloud will help our business

207
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,479
to grow and mobile first

208
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,639
when we look at uh

209
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,800
the areas that we want the new leaders

210
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
of shift left to focus on uh

211
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
understanding what the mission is using

212
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
the mission defined in previous sessions

213
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
to break down

214
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
the value chain so we understand where

215
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
we want to focus on security

216
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
perform prior to threat requirements

217
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
don't try to protect the whole of the

218
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,599
organization we're trying to prioritize

219
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,039
and when we do is we prioritize on

220
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,199
what's critical to our business and

221
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,560
what's critical to make sure that we

222
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
have resiliency at the heart of our

223
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,479
organization

224
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,199
map the uh priority threat requirements

225
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,039
to technology and how those technologies

226
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,960
can be used by my current workforce and

227
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
understand where the gaps are strategize

228
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
understand where we want to strategize

229
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
on make sure that our organizations

230
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,520
understand

231
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
the partnerships that we want to focus

232
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
on and where we can build

233
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
when we look at why this is important we

234
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,280
want to secure the enterprise where

235
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,639
they're securing the transformation

236
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,919
whatever digital transformation you're

237
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,360
going through whether it's cloud

238
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
adoption your value chain

239
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
or your infrastructure when we look at

240
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,039
the enterprise it falls down into the

241
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,400
typical

242
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,039
key pillars of identity applications

243
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,680
data and also monitoring as well

244
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
key focus for us at microfocus is

245
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,360
actually enabling the business to become

246
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,840
