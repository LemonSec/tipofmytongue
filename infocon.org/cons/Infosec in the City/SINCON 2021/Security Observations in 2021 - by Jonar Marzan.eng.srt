1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,279
hey everyone my name is jonah merzan i'm

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,440
your strategy consultant brand new and i

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,960
will be talking about my secret

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,599
observation since 2021

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,679
a bit of info about myself i grew up in

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,600
the dial-up days where it takes hours

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
just to download and listen to music i

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
was heavily influenced by technology and

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
considered myself as a baby then just

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,080
gradually transitioned more towards the

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,560
business side of things in my consulting

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,240
experience i've worked with big

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,238
multinational financial institutions

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,880
from providing strategic direction to

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,640
technical implementation

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,239
now here in harangi i'm currently

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,879
providing vcso or sees as a service to

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,040
our customers talking about cyber risk

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,640
to the business leaders

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,879
before we dive in i'd like to introduce

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,239
who we are

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,559
we are harangi and we empower customers

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,800
to innovate without fear porangi is a

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
leading cyber security company founded

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,600
by ex-volunteer technology engineers it

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,760
is headquartered here in singapore our

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,399
cloud security platform called warden

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
protects organizations in the public

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,720
cloud we have a team of cyber security

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,040
experts providing strategic and

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
offensive cyber services to customers

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
across the world

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,080
so

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,439
let's start

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,240
on today's agenda i will be covering the

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,920
growing importance of workform home

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
security and cloud security being now

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,560
mandatory

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,240
majority of the workforce that have

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,400
shifted the remote work last year are

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
still working from home up to today and

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,560
the trend is likely to stay

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
because of the new working environment

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
many have become digital tech experts

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
workers started to rely on their own

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
devices due to the lack of in-person id

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,960
support

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
but at the same time cyber attacks are

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
on the rise as online remote work

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,040
increases cyber security risk

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
the biggest risk

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
it's still phishing

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
it's still a human problem whether you

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,119
talk about

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,159
ransomware or compromise credentials

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,320
most of the time phishing was used in

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,520
some way

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,000
from a big four consulting firm report

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
it says that 47 of individuals

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
called for phishing scams while working

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
at home because back in the office it

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
was easy for a user who received a

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
malicious email to

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
turn to the next person

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,879
or walk over to holly to verify the

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,920
email

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
being remote this isn't an option

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
anymore and attackers are exploiting

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,560
this a skilled attacker creates a sense

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
of urgency within the email with the

71
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
intent to make the user do as the

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,959
attacker once before the user even has

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
time to think about it

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
that's why when you're home alone

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
the odd swing and the attackers favor

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
phishing is real and it's getting harder

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,879
to identify legitimate links

78
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,360
the best solution is to really grow the

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,239
security culture of your company and

80
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
the more people that are vigilant about

81
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,800
this and take it seriously the better

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
off you will be

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
with everyone moving to the cloud

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
especially software as a service or we

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
call it sas

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
it's fast and that's great but it also

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
creates new security challenges

88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,720
breaches are moving toward social and

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,280
web application vectors such as

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
gathering credentials and then using

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,159
them against cloud-based email systems

92
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,840
and this is regardless of organization

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
size and industry whether you're a tech

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,599
startup or a multinational bank

95
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,080
you're a target for a cyber attack so

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
what can organizations do

97
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,879
first organizations need to adopt a

98
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
robust phishing simulation program and

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,400
conduct frequent security reviews you

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
need to create that culture internally

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,440
of having

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
verifications outside of the norm new

103
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
procedures need to be created around

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,440
security you need to

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
you need to ensure stronger home network

106
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,799
security and enhance endpoint protection

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,519
new approaches such as secure access

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
service edge or we call it sassy

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,920
zero trust model

110
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
extended detection response or xdr need

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,319
to be considered in light of the

112
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,920
explosion of devices and users

113
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
next

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
on-boarding and off-boarding are key

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,399
areas of mistakes in most businesses and

116
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,120
is really hard with the modern workforce

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
organizations should adopt stringent

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,199
onboarding and off-boarding processes

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,040
and policies to mitigate insider

120
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,479
interface

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,880
you can use a remote desktop such as

122
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,360
aws workspaces for temporary employees

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
or other personnel who aren't issued a

124
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
company that

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
in most companies

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,520
these days their cloud is where most of

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,160
their crown jewels are stored and there

128
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
needs to be more active effort in making

129
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,280
it work

130
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
in spite of continuously trying to

131
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,840
improve access management there's still

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,759
a high possibility that someone download

133
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,840
sensitive data to one unprotected

134
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,000
environment when working from home

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
so like us here randi we propered google

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,360
dlp solution to monitor potential leak

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
of data from the cloud storage

138
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,680
this is a focus on

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,720
visibility and monitoring taking a

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
proactive stance that mistakes and

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
attacks will happen

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
the access points are environment and

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,400
cloud are essential to places to monitor

144
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
organizations need to ensure that access

145
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
permissions are granted within what

146
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,600
permissions people need vpns are the

147
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,080
most used and most often vulnerable tool

148
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
in the work from home setup so if you

149
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
host the vpn in the cloud you have to

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,039
monitor your threats to that vpn

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
here at marangi we have developed our

152
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
own threat monitoring functions on our

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
cloud security product to monitor those

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,759
threats

155
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
another observation is that more work

156
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,520
from home also means more rapid cloud

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,000
adoption as companies become more and

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
more dependent on cloud services

159
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,639
to process and store their data cloud

160
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,360
security is not optional anymore

161
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
we have seen that the growth of

162
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
public cloud services has been

163
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
exponential and every organization's

164
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
possible attack surface is

165
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
quickly growing with the adoption of

166
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
cloud-based apps like like zoom and

167
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,160
office 365 but

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,520
only 10 of csos reported that they have

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
fully understand the shared

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,000
responsibility model and 82

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
have experienced security incidents due

172
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
to the confusion over who has

173
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,120
responsibility for what's in the cloud

174
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
this can lead to mistaken belief that

175
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,919
executives aren't liable for losses as a

176
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,160
result of a cloud breach

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,199
and

178
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,520
this goes down to the security teams

179
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
that are dealing these issues directly

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
on a day-to-day basis

181
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
first issue is skills shortage

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
we all know

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,199
about the engineering space here in

184
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,919
southeast asia's very competitive market

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,400
cyber security is no different

186
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
the organization isc2 actually estimates

187
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
that asia has a shortage of

188
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
over 2 million cyber security experts

189
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,919
with cloud security being a new field

190
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,919
there are even less expertise available

191
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,880
second lack of visibility if developers

192
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,919
can spin and shut down cloud's cloud

193
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,160
instances with a few clicks how can

194
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
security teams have full visibility of

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
this growing and fast changing network

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,120
the lack of visibility makes risk

197
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,479
assessment more

198
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
challenging and they either

199
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
become overly permissive

200
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
or they lock down everything

201
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
if we remember the capital one data

202
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,400
breach last 2019 we're in personal data

203
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,319
of 100 million customers were

204
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,960
exfiltrated because of excessive

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,639
permissions according to the

206
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,840
investigation the attacker the attack

207
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,319
occurred due to a misconfiguration error

208
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,000
at the application layer of a firewall

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,879
we call it waft then exacerbated by

210
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,199
permission set by capital one

211
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
with this clearly

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
principle of lease privilege and

213
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
identity authentication and access

214
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
management are your crews are very

215
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
crucial for securing your cloud-based

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,280
applications and resources

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,919
the likelihood and impact of her breach

218
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
goes up dramatically when access is

219
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
improperly managed

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,199
on the identity side nearly all breaches

221
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,599
involve misuse of an identity and the

222
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,039
number of identities is growing

223
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,520
exponentially on the asset side

224
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,719
traditionally this is this is seen as a

225
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,958
this is a balance between security and

226
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,760
speed so if you have too little access

227
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,000
things are locked down but innovation is

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
hamburg

229
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,519
if you give too much access innovation

230
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,640
is facilitated but security risks blow

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,279
out of control increasing the likelihood

232
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,399
and impact of big breach

233
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,800
what we don't see emphasize enough is

234
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
the ability

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
is the ability to look at usage

236
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,720
and make general recommendations around

237
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,399
reducing privilege

238
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,399
and encouraging the constant changing of

239
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,399
peace and password on a regular basis

240
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,360
when we talk about iam complexity

241
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,839
especially in the cloud we talk about

242
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
complexity of scale understanding and

243
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,399
change

244
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
complexity of scale is about the many

245
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,120
identities services permissions and

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,880
resources

247
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
um complexity of understanding is about

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
the expertise required to understand

249
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,839
nuances so if you can imagine there are

250
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,200
9 331 ews permission

251
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
that's a lot to understand

252
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
and then finally complexity of change

253
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,640
this involves

254
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
rapidly changing

255
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,200
rapidly evolving needs privileged creep

256
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
and frequent updates to cloud service

257
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
provider offerings like just last 2019

258
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,160
aws added over 35 services in their

259
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,839
in their portfolio

260
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,760
so in this case what can organizations

261
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
do

262
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,800
well

263
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,440
you can only protect what you know

264
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,519
having central visibility solves a

265
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,880
pivotal problem created by cloud sprawl

266
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,920
look at solutions classified as sspm and

267
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,279
ciem

268
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,120
sspm or

269
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
sas security posture management provides

270
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
contain automated continuous monitoring

271
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
of sas applications like slab salesforce

272
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
and microsoft 365 to minimize risky

273
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,120
configurations prevent configuration

274
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,440
drift and help security and it teams to

275
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
ensure compliance

276
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
ciem or cloud infrastructure entitlement

277
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
management solutions manage identities

278
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,079
and access privileges in cloud and

279
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,360
multi-cloud environments

280
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
with the speed of change in the cloud

281
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
you can leverage security and compliance

282
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,079
automation to fix threats as they come

283
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
so they don't get forgotten

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
look at solutions classified as cspm and

285
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
cwpp

286
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
cspm or cloud security posture

287
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
management has now been classified as a

288
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,200
mandatory mandatory tool by gartner cwpp

289
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
or cloud workload protection platforms

290
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
are endpoint protection solutions

291
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
specifically tailored to server the

292
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,000
workloads wherever and however they are

293
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,399
running whether that's virtual machine

294
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,240
public cloud infrastructure or platform

295
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,880
as a service or our container-based

296
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,120
application architectures

297
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
if you go back to that capital one

298
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
breach example these solutions could

299
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
have prevented those misconfigurations

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
in their cloud environment

301
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
and um

302
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
i know it's a lot of new acronym

303
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,959
acronyms and it's not the easiest to

304
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,079
digest

305
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,920
and it's the same feedback that we hear

306
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,480
from our customers they say

307
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
that they don't have an easy solution

308
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,040
for this that's why uh horandi created a

309
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,200
platform to help provide this cloud

310
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,519
visibility instead of having to go

311
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,480
through multiple windows platforms or

312
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
tabs in your native cloud provider

313
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,399
consoles our cloud security product

314
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,320
warden gives you a quick summary of key

315
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
insights in the unifi dashboard

316
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
fast forward to the day we made great

317
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,079
progress from the dial-up era compared

318
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,480
to today's super fast internet speed and

319
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
now with cloud technology today we

320
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,399
listen to music in seconds through

321
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,120
streaming apps connected to the cloud

322
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,079
but some things just don't change

323
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,399
attackers will find new ways to exploit

324
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
human psychology and system

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
vulnerabilities while defenders like us

326
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,480
need to constantly upskill and leverage

327
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
easy to use innovative solutions to

328
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,279
tackle these new challenges such as work

329
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,079
from home and cloud security risk

330
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,200
cyber security is a human problem

331
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,959
people should always be trained and

332
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
those should be innovative and easy to

333
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,279
use

334
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,959
all right those were my security

335
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,200
observations for this year feel free to

336
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,440
reach out if you have any questions

337
