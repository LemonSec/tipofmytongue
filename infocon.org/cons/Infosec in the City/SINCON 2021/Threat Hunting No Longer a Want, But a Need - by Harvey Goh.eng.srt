1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,160
hi everyone i'm harvey from so forces

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
managed track response team

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,320
today i would like to talk about tread

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,799
hunting and why it's no longer just a

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,680
once but a necessity in today's cyber

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
security landscape

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,000
so let's look at the trends that's

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,920
happening today

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,720
as you know everyone is going online

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,720
every business has to be online to

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,760
survive

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
that's just the reality of things

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,920
the attack surface is expanding and

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,239
unfortunately that's where the attackers

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,239
are also gaining ground

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,239
there's also a very big problem of the

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,800
ever-present security gap right the

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,680
security skills gap i would say a lot of

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
times that it's really hard to find

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,960
someone that actually understands

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
security or even understands

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
everything from a malicious payload or

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
behaviors of attack

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
so and the problem here is

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
there's always a problem of the

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
confidence in security right as you can

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,640
see here

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,400
right this is even though this report

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
was done by accenture back in 2019 it

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
pretty much is accurate today so as you

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
can see here is predicted that in year

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
2023 which is just two years uh no

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,119
away right that the confidence for

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,280
security is dropping down to 25

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,759
so here's the thing here is no

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
organization here can prevent a breach

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,000
that is the mindset today

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
so look let's look at the actual threat

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
landscape that's happening around us

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
right now

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,600
so let me bring you back in time so back

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,399
in the day no tractors usually were not

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,280
that

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
um dangerous in that sense right they're

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
all usually just people trying to prove

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
themselves

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
they're just doing things having fun

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,439
they're just not doing joke awares

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,439
trying to prove themselves by saying i

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,759
managed to access this data which no

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,759
it's off limits to everyone

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,040
that was basically the trend back then

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
unfortunately today

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,160
we have organized criminal groups

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,560
right they basically run like an

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,720
organization right like any big

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
organization they do have a team leader

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
they do have a coder

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,480
interestingly they also have network

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,640
administrators and so on and so forth

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
that's how organized these criminal

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
groups are today in fact some of these

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,599
components are even outsourced right

64
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,000
they are some providers

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
uh no in the dark web that provides

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,120
certain services like botnet services

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
for example that you can actually buy

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,080
off and some of these organized groups

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
work in tandem with these outsource

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,200
suppliers

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,160
and why is that the case like why is it

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,760
that we move on from like just a solo

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
attractor trying to have fun to

74
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,280
know kind of like a business model here

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
well it's because of profit here so as

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,959
you can see here

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,519
right that the cyber crime profits saw

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
to 1.5 trillion and this report was in

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
2018

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
and no a little bit more recent 2020

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,319
right

82
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,280
it has reached 3.5 billion

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
in 2019

84
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
so as you can see here it's just a trend

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
that's ongoing

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
so it is a very profitable business

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,319
and we as with any business people

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,519
always put in efforts to make it better

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,920
right and that's just how it is with

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,040
even cyber crimes

91
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
so let's touch a little bit on this

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
concept of parameter pain i'm sure all

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,799
you security folks out there know about

94
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
this concept here but let me just know

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,720
kind of like

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,799
do a little recap for everyone so

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,280
basically what a perimeter pain is is

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,239
how much pain do you cause the tractor

99
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,120
when you block this particular component

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,959
so as you can see from this parameter

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,000
pin

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,159
looking at just ips and hashes which is

103
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,239
very common in iocs

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,080
is really simple for a tractor it

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
doesn't cause that much pain

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,920
why because today right since they are

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,439
running like a business

108
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,759
they have teams at the back end they

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,639
have as mentioned outsourced services

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,240
they add a snap of finger they can

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,600
change the ip

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
now as a step over finger i can ask my

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
team no

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,759
we compile this malware and i get a new

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,520
hash value

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
and that's how quickly they can do it

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
right within seconds

118
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
so we need to look further up the

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
pyramid today we need to look up for

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
everything from the tools and the ttps

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
to really really cause kind of pain to

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,880
the tractors here

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
one thing to also note is tractors are

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,199
also aware of this

125
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,199
it's not just us defenders

126
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,800
and this is proven

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,479
through all the different sources that

128
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
we can see

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
so as you can see here tractors have

130
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,759
actually created all these marketplaces

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,280
or even dumps

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,680
within the dark websites so you have

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
everything for credential dams dumps

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
credentials for sale

135
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
no in in this example here of genesis

136
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
store this is actually a store that

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
sells access to computers so basically

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,120
what they do is they collect information

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
about computer everything from all the

140
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
websites that there this computer have

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
access to passwords cookie information

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,160
and basically what happens is when you

143
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
buy this

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
you basically can kind of clone out that

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,639
computer since you have the cookies you

146
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,320
even have the um the ip information

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,039
right so you kind of can clone yourself

148
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,000
to pretend to be that particular machine

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
and that's how effective it is

150
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,680
bear in mind

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
that even this website is automated

152
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,800
it is not just a bunch of tractors

153
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
sitting there collecting all this

154
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,199
information and posting it on this store

155
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
jessica store is actually create managed

156
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,400
automatically by robots

157
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,039
right so basically what the bots do is

158
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,160
they look at

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
the machine that they have

160
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
what

161
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
um what applications do they have access

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,240
to

163
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
right everything from dropbox no what

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,479
whatever is useful

165
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,720
if that if that particular machine has

166
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,400
very very useful tools on them

167
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,120
right

168
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,160
access to certain websites that are

169
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
exclusive for example

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
the price

171
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
goes up

172
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,280
and that is done automatically

173
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
so basically that's how

174
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,280
the tractors have advanced

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
right they have advanced to

176
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,759
collaborating with robots to basically

177
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,639
do their business

178
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
we even have websites that sell you know

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,319
what we call

180
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,520
uh

181
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,000
fully undetectable malware or fats for

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,199
short

183
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,440
so you can see these two examples here

184
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
right of these are websites they're

185
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
actually selling ransomwares

186
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,639
no and they even guarantee you that they

187
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,440
are undetectable by today's

188
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
anti-malware vendors

189
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,759
so that's how advanced it is

190
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,759
and you can even pay them and tell them

191
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,120
hey please customize this malware to do

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,840
this and put on this message for me they

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
will do it for you

194
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
and this is what i meant by outsourced

195
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,840
services

196
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
we even have websites that actually sell

197
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
exploits so even though they state here

198
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,080
that oh this is for

199
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,479
educational purposes

200
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,080
but you know

201
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
let's be realistic here

202
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,160
i can go there buy this exploit and use

203
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,479
it for malicious use

204
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,400
they are not going to care

205
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
right and and that's how it is

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,199
you can just go online no collaborate

207
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
with any of these groups

208
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
build your own malware and start your

209
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,840
campaign

210
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,039
another trend that so far is seeing is

211
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,160
what we call

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
living off the land attacks

213
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
so what this means is the tractors have

214
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
also known right as a reference to the

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
primary opinion they know

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
that

217
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,759
no today everyone's really very advanced

218
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,080
they pick up hashes really quickly they

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
pick up ips very quickly they know so i

220
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,240
can't use my tools against you

221
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
so what do they do

222
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
no they use whatever tools are already

223
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,479
available on the system

224
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,800
so if you guys are familiar right like

225
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
for example ps exec pskill

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,599
these are tools that are readily

227
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,120
available on a windows platform

228
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
these tools no originally right the

229
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
intent is more for administrators

230
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
they are very powerful tools they allow

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,120
administrators to run remotely any

232
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
command they wish

233
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,399
or even kill any process they want

234
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
however attractors have also

235
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
known about this since these tools are

236
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,519
really available on the system

237
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
and it is very unlikely that

238
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
any security controls would block them

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
since they are valid administrative

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
tools

241
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
the tractor uses

242
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,720
these tools against you

243
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,519
we have seen attacks that use psq to try

244
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,240
to terminate security controls

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,120
followed by ps exec to basically run

246
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,399
everything from

247
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,680
cnc commands to download downloading of

248
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,839
their backdoors

249
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,320
so those are things that happens

250
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,959
and that's the reality of things that

251
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,359
tractors are advancing their methods

252
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
it's not just the tools that they are

253
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,399
doing right even the

254
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,640
the procedures they're doing

255
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
so as you can see in this example here

256
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,920
of this

257
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
research article

258
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
they mentioned something called triple

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
extortion

260
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,439
so what is that

261
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,640
so back in the day when a ransomware

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
attack happens all it does it encrypts

263
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
your data and then you get a note to say

264
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,360
please pay this amount and we'll decrypt

265
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,399
your data

266
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,480
so that is one level of extortion

267
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,399
then we see interactors starting to do

268
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
what we call double extortion which is

269
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
if you do not pay us

270
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
to decrypt your data

271
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,160
we will

272
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,959
post your information to the public we

273
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,959
will let the whole world see know

274
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,320
everything from your accounts your

275
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,040
business dealings and so and so forth

276
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,079
that was the double extortion technique

277
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,399
and today we are seeing tractors even

278
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,320
advancing further to what we call a

279
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
triple extortion which is basically if

280
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,399
you don't pay up

281
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,120
we will ddos

282
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,839
no you

283
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,800
basically to kind of convince you right

284
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
to come back to uh to them to negotiate

285
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,519
to pay

286
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,200
so this is unfortunate that even

287
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
tractors have evolved their methods as

288
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,399
mentioned they are like a business

289
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
they they want to make a profit

290
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,519
and they know and they will chase for it

291
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
so here's the thing that we also need to

292
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,640
take note i'm very sure everyone heard

293
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,600
of ai and how ai will help the security

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,279
solutions

295
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,399
but

296
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,279
the fact remains no then we need to be

297
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,720
aware of this

298
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,040
it's not just on the defenders

299
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,600
even the attackers here

300
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
so here's two articles that i picked up

301
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
that basic tractors are also using ai

302
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,920
which makes sense think about it

303
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
would you would the tractor be using a

304
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,880
team

305
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
just to scour the internet for

306
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
vulnerable servers

307
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
that's not what they're doing they're

308
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
doing something for automation

309
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
right so that's the thing here tractors

310
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,120
are using some form of ai

311
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,560
right to basically

312
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,399
fight against what we use which is ai

313
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,320
the only difference here is

314
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,959
the tractors have evolved themselves to

315
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,519
embrace this collaboration

316
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
right they have used ai tools to churn

317
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
out malwares

318
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
to kind of detect behaviors detect

319
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
vulnerabilities for example weak weak

320
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,160
systems but they also use their human

321
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,200
expertise to break into your system

322
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,279
and basically as you've seen for example

323
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,360
the cheaper extortion method there's

324
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
basically a human there that thought of

325
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,720
the idea

326
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,320
so that's how they have actually

327
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,800
collaborated and that brings about a

328
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,040
very big question

329
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,519
if the attackers are doing that why

330
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,240
aren't we the defenders why aren't we

331
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,560
embracing this collaboration and not

332
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
just solely depending on ai and hoping

333
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,839
that the artificial intelligence of our

334
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,399
cyber security solutions will do

335
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,839
everything for us

336
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
realistically that's not going to happen

337
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
so i brought up this article here

338
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
right and and this article is basically

339
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
to help you guys know be a little bit

340
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,639
more focused on this is that

341
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,240
based on the various verizon 2021 dbi or

342
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,480
data breach investigation it really

343
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
shows that there's no such thing as a

344
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,320
safe industry

345
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,959
right i've spoken to a few customers

346
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,360
here and no some of them have the

347
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
assumption that oh i'm not a big bank

348
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,320
for example i wouldn't get attacked

349
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
but unfortunately that's not the case

350
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
we have seen some small companies ever

351
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,279
get hit

352
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920
by ransomware attacks

353
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
and they were pretty advanced

354
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
everyone is a target

355
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
the other thing to note is tractors are

356
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,199
really moving fast

357
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,320
right

358
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
they don't really spend a lot of time

359
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,959
within lateral movement for example

360
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,680
so take take for example right the the

361
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,600
at the haven attack

362
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,399
right

363
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
so let's go back in time and look at

364
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,199
this attack and study the entire no

365
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,240
timeline of it

366
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,480
so back in october first right that is

367
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
when

368
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,920
this changta guy started the

369
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,320
investigation he started his research on

370
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
this but um exchange

371
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,399
looking up whether there's such a

372
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,160
vulnerability

373
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,240
he also know only

374
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
about

375
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
two months right where he actually

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,800
discovered

377
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
this particular vulnerability and they

378
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
attacked it with this cve

379
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
right the

380
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
five cve202126855

381
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,880
which we today know as the half name

382
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,439
activity

383
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
however if you can see the gap here

384
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,519
right it's only in january six

385
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,320
that microsoft acknowledged that of this

386
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
vulnerability

387
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,720
so

388
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,160
about one month later does microsoft say

389
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
yes this vulnerability

390
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,319
is exists on my exchange server

391
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,600
in march first that's when microsoft

392
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
disclosed of the hafnium activity

393
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,720
so you can see here there's this huge

394
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,240
gap there

395
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
right almost two months

396
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
of when they acknowledge the

397
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,040
vulnerability not even when the

398
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,959
track researcher discovered it well when

399
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,000
they acknowledged it to the day that no

400
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,839
they did they disclosed that of this

401
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,920
housing activity it was about two months

402
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,160
and further research actually shows that

403
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
the very first possible exploitation of

404
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
this vulnerability was way back in

405
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
november 2020

406
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,880
so you can see here the tractor

407
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,120
basically had this huge

408
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,440
window to attack environments

409
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,160
when did microsoft release the patch

410
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
well you can see here

411
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,839
the patch was released in march the 2nd

412
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,959
2021 so if you look back at the timeline

413
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,360
then the question comes about how big is

414
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,079
your window of exposure

415
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,639
right since it is possible that they

416
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,800
haven't activity started way back in

417
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
november

418
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,079
do you just patch your system

419
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,639
and no pray for the best

420
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,480
or do you patch your system and start to

421
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,920
investigate

422
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,959
back

423
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,560
from the day you patch all the way back

424
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,959
to november were there any suspicious

425
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,000
activities happening in your environment

426
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,519
i think that's a very important question

427
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,720
that we need to ask ourselves

428
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,079
so here are a few more examples here

429
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,839
right as you can see here

430
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,800
no

431
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,120
bit locker ran somewhere right

432
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,399
as you know bit locker is something

433
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
available on all windows machines and

434
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
they're actually a tool to help us

435
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,360
encrypt our systems to protect them

436
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,000
unfortunately in this case it was used

437
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
against us

438
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
so this is a pretty good example of

439
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,600
using a tool that is already available

440
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
on your system against you

441
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
we have also seen

442
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,839
now in this epsilon rate right another

443
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,000
ransomware but in this case it uses

444
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,160
powershell scripts basically it doesn't

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
do any it doesn't really use any

446
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,720
payloads basically all these you know

447
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,199
bare bones ransomware does is all the

448
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,559
functionalities are running off

449
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
powershell which i mentioned earlier on

450
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,119
living off the lander text pretty much

451
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,760
undetectable because most security

452
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,280
products or most users trust these tools

453
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,440
because they are inbuilt windows tools

454
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
you know

455
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,400
splitting a little bit more is a little

456
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
bit more recent right we've seen the

457
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,039
epoxy shell exchange exploit and again

458
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
the quantity group was really quick in

459
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,679
using this exploit to launch their

460
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
ransomware tags

461
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,520
right something a little bit more um

462
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,440
interesting which is from

463
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,240
so forces on research

464
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,080
we actually discovered

465
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
for on one of our customers a very

466
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,640
stealthy ransomware operator right they

467
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
can't use something you know what you

468
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
call dll site loading

469
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,400
kind of to hide their tracks well but

470
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
this basically shows that again they are

471
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,799
using a lot of this not just a

472
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,840
combination of exploits but also certain

473
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,200
things like living off the land

474
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,480
basically the dlls within uh a system to

475
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
kind of like run this stuff stealthy

476
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
attacks

477
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
so that's how much

478
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,000
the tractors have evolved

479
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
so let's come back to this how about us

480
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
the cyber defenders

481
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,919
how have we evolved

482
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,760
right

483
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,480
so a little quote from one of my buddies

484
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,799
here in the manage track response team

485
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,840
right which i really really think it's

486
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
valid

487
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
that human experience and the ability to

488
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,240
respond a vital part of any security

489
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
solution

490
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,200
so that's really only so much

491
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,280
machines can do right machines are

492
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,919
designed to look up for patterns collect

493
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,039
data

494
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,919
as quickly as possible right that's what

495
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,919
machines do and they are really great at

496
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,799
that

497
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,919
but sometimes it is really difficult to

498
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,840
ask a machine to

499
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,559
can you see if this is bad

500
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,559
if there's no baseline for the machine

501
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,840
the machine is not going to be able to

502
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,679
tell you that

503
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,120
a machine still needs some form of

504
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,720
baseline to and build build an entire

505
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,440
table like in a sense to kind of know

506
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,600
what is good and what's bad

507
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
but from a human approach when you look

508
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,480
at it

509
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
you know your your gut feeling sometimes

510
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
to tells you something else

511
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
and i think that's where human

512
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,280
experience comes into play

513
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
i think this is further reinforced in a

514
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,520
report that i read in fsi sec

515
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,160
so in this report you just mentioned

516
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,640
that you kind of need that right mix of

517
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,720
automation and human intelligence to

518
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,559
really build a

519
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,520
very strong security controls right a

520
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,360
basic security program in place

521
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,440
right so as you can see they also

522
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,679
mentioned here that no cybers still need

523
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,799
human

524
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,760
right

525
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,480
and i think with my further um

526
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,919
explanation of it

527
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,400
tractors are also doing that combination

528
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
tractors are not just relying on their

529
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,039
you know ai to basically attack

530
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,559
environments here

531
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,960
but they use it to open the door

532
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
but they are using humans to do what you

533
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,880
call hands-on keyboard living out the

534
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,480
lan attacks here

535
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,640
so you know kind of we need to do the

536
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,320
same to basically defend ourselves

537
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,200
so i've been talking about all those

538
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,840
concepts here so what is exactly what is

539
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,440
tread hunting

540
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
so i would say let's sum it up right

541
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,600
assume rich mindset

542
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,360
so trying to think is really different

543
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
it's not just about monitoring for

544
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,360
alerts

545
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,200
it's basically assuming that you've

546
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
already been breached

547
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
for example right you look at a report

548
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
and you understood oh okay this is new

549
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
attack so let's just use let's go back

550
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,039
in time and think of half name for

551
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,480
example

552
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,200
and you read the report about half name

553
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
what do you do

554
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,280
do you just say okay yeah i'm safe

555
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
no that's not how trending works

556
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
basically trending what we will do is we

557
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,480
look at the report and we look okay

558
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,559
these are the type of

559
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,120
things i notice obviously the research

560
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,000
talks about that half new activity does

561
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
i will go back and look at my

562
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,320
environment do i see such activities

563
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,159
happening

564
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,000
so basically that's the assumed rich

565
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
mindset

566
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,840
right i assume i'm rich i'm looking for

567
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,240
something suspicious based it could be

568
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,720
based on my own

569
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
ideas of what i would look out for like

570
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,480
for example uh suspicious logins during

571
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,840
our office hours

572
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,640
that's a that's a very simple one or

573
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,240
looking at this style track research

574
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,120
right from external track intelligence

575
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,360
and kind of like use that within my own

576
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,880
environment

577
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,280
and most importantly the most important

578
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,559
thing is it's not looking out for iocs

579
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,200
expansion early on iocs are really easy

580
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
to change today

581
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,600
right they are good indicators

582
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,240
but the thing here is they get still

583
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,919
really really quickly

584
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,000
so the main thing to look out for is

585
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
indicators of attack looking out for

586
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,720
that pattern of this particular campaign

587
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,720
so this picture here i think everyone's

588
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
seen this picture here right um of a

589
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,039
sock everyone assumes that's how it

590
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,080
looks like a room full of monitors and a

591
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,440
bunch of people staring at those

592
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
monitors

593
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,080
and everyone's solution back then was

594
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
let's all build a sock

595
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
and that's i'm not saying that's wrong

596
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
that's right right that's the right

597
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,919
approach that's the idea here we need

598
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,799
humans to look at all this information

599
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,440
however i think the it got blurred you

600
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,400
know

601
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
through the times

602
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
and a lot of people assume that to build

603
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,840
a sock what i need is to buy

604
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,720
the most expensive tools i can find

605
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,440
right they buy a really expensive same

606
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
essentially saw they are great they are

607
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,280
great tools

608
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
but again that's the main thing the key

609
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,840
word is they are tools

610
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,159
you need the team to be able to

611
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,720
understand what am i looking out for

612
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,280
right a sim cannot magically collect and

613
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,200
tell you i'm under attack the same is

614
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
just collecting data from different

615
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,120
points from could be your endpoint your

616
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,080
firewall your network devices or even

617
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,480
your login or system events from your

618
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,799
servers that's all the sim is doing it's

619
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,880
basically collecting all these really

620
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
quickly into a single place

621
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,640
and you know correlate all this

622
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,960
information together but it's also based

623
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,400
on the human tools look at all the

624
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,720
information and say is this suspicious

625
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,320
activity or is it just a one-off

626
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,679
right so that's

627
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,159
the main misconception i would like to

628
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,480
bring about that we need to change that

629
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,000
perception of what a stock should be

630
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,320
even today right everyone is evolving

631
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
the sock to include tread hunting right

632
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,279
not just about alert more interviewing

633
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,799
not just about what my tools are

634
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,960
bringing to me but

635
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,440
well adding on the capabilities of

636
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,000
hunting for threats proactively

637
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,120
so a survey by so force right has both

638
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,600
even proven this further that you guys

639
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
can see here we have did a survey across

640
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
different countries and we actually

641
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,679
asked them this question what are your

642
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,400
plans to incorporate human lecture hunts

643
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,760
so as you can see

644
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
majority

645
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,240
right

646
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,720
some already doing it which is fantastic

647
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,840
but many have plans to implement it

648
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
so i would like to use this diagram here

649
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,559
to actually explain that process

650
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,080
and i really love this diagram i've been

651
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,600
using this diagram for quite a couple of

652
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,039
years already

653
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
so as you can see here data right on the

654
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,520
top left just no empty white dots

655
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,760
that is basically what data is

656
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,679
right data is useful right everyone says

657
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,039
that which is true

658
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,600
but if you don't convert the data to

659
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,039
information

660
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,720
you don't connect the dots to turn it

661
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,159
into knowledge

662
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,679
right and then you do that foresight

663
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,120
kind of understand no that's where your

664
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,799
insight comes in

665
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,400
and then you convert you know and you

666
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,320
connect the dots and unsaid oh okay this

667
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
is what this data means

668
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,760
and that's your wisdom

669
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,679
and from then on you can come up with

670
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,960
the impact

671
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
i think this basically is a great way to

672
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,279
illustrate what i'm talking about here

673
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,279
so your same and saw probably are great

674
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,679
at collecting the data they probably can

675
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,360
help you do a bit of correlation give

676
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,039
you the information and the knowledge

677
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,000
there

678
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,400
but i think you really need your team

679
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,320
right your sock team your trade ending

680
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,120
team

681
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,840
to look at all this information and kind

682
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
of convert it into

683
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,480
you know usable effective impact

684
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,039
i bring up this

685
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,360
um table here and i think a lot of you

686
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,919
security folks here know of know this

687
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,320
that the miter attack framework right

688
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,080
everyone more or less knows about this

689
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,039
but why am i bringing this up here

690
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,279
so the thing here is a lot of the

691
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,039
security folks here they understand that

692
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,360
what the mighty framework is for

693
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,000
basically it helps you to tag right um

694
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,159
when i see this okay what sort of

695
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,559
id this belongs to and this falls under

696
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,640
for example the discovery stage of

697
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,760
attack

698
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,159
right and that's really useful

699
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,840
but the thing is

700
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,080
as the trending team

701
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,600
is also about

702
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
looking out at what i'm seeing in my

703
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,279
environment

704
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,960
and figuring out

705
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,400
this behavior

706
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
what id does it match up to in the miter

707
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,559
tech framework

708
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
why is that important

709
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,159
one is to help you to kind of like

710
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,440
streamline and understand is is this uh

711
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
what attack is happening here at what

712
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,840
stage of the attack is happening here

713
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
so why is this important because let's

714
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,000
say for example i discover

715
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,320
a particular behavior i mapped it to a

716
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,039
miter attack id and i seen that oh this

717
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,440
is in lateral movement

718
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,360
right

719
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,600
that the track hunting team shouldn't

720
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,279
stop there

721
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,399
because

722
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,320
identifying that is lateral movement

723
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,440
means that the this particular attack

724
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,880
has already gone through the stages from

725
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
initial access all the way down to

726
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,440
discovery

727
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,240
right

728
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
that's not right right if you if the

729
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,960
track hunting team is so focused on just

730
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,000
blocking

731
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,440
right since they have that's what they

732
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,360
discovered i'm trying to block the

733
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,200
lateral movement they are not going to

734
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,960
stop the tractor here

735
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
because the tractor has already got a

736
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,919
foothold in your environment they

737
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,000
already have the initial access

738
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
right they already have the discovery

739
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
and all and so on and so forth

740
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,159
so as a trending team it's really

741
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,000
important to identify

742
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,240
what are the hints from what i've

743
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,279
discovered today i trying to link it

744
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,960
back upwards

745
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,559
because end of the day it's more

746
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,960
important to block attack at the earlier

747
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,720
stage of the attack

748
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,840
right

749
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,080
basically whatever is earlier is

750
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,600
basically covering up your security gaps

751
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,520
for example right

752
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,600
the attack could have not

753
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,159
come from this particular machine

754
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,520
this particular machine could be doing

755
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,960
the lateral movement

756
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,799
but for all you know after deeper

757
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,200
investigation you discover that

758
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,559
that machine got

759
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,000
infected through a server that was not

760
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
patched and that's the

761
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,720
initial access

762
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,679
so

763
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,320
you handling just on that machine it's

764
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,080
not going to help you much because the

765
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,480
tractor has access to that server and

766
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,399
they'll probably use server to do other

767
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,559
forms of attacks

768
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,480
so so that's the importance of

769
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,640
understanding the miter attack framework

770
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
so as mentioned earlier right about the

771
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,360
window exposure

772
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,080
the track hunter team needs to be really

773
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
aware of this

774
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,480
right it's not about when

775
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,760
the of the vendor releases the patch

776
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,640
right

777
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,120
your investigation should begin from the

778
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,640
day you patch

779
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,520
back

780
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
backwards all the way to

781
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
when was the

782
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,440
most likely possible first date of

783
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,240
exploitation

784
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
right because

785
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,960
that's your window exposure

786
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
and yours your child entity needs to

787
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,799
understand this and look out for any

788
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,679
hints

789
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,679
or any suspicious activities that happen

790
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,360
within this window

791
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,679
and and see if they are connected back

792
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,159
to that particular exploit

793
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,360
if they do

794
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,279
then they need to basically remove all

795
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,360
persistence that the tractors already

796
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,719
injected into the environment

797
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,880
so another thing about you know the

798
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,360
skill sets so all we here we're talking

799
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,799
about is basically skill sets that are

800
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,919
required

801
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,919
right the skill another skill set that

802
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,559
is really useful for any

803
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,360
stock team it's basically an individual

804
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,480
or a team

805
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,640
which is even better to basically do

806
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,880
what i call attack analysis right

807
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,799
understanding how

808
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,520
this payload behaves for example right

809
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
so again i'm not talking about hashes or

810
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,840
ips i'm talking about the behaviors does

811
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
this payload you know how what does it

812
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,399
do does it try to change the system

813
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,640
registries does it try to

814
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,279
use powershell from that point onwards

815
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,120
all these type of behaviors

816
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,279
those are basically expertise that are

817
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,640
required

818
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,799
even more even better if the team is

819
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,240
able to decipher malware payloads right

820
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,399
see how the script is running what is

821
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,559
this script trying to do right we have

822
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,039
seen many trackers try to hide their

823
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,640
code using base 64. right so

824
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
does your team know like when i look at

825
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,600
this i need to maybe use everything from

826
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,000
7-zip to decrypt it followed by a base64

827
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,640
decryption which actually happens

828
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
that's a that's the basic skill set and

829
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,080
experience that's required

830
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,000
using all those information of course

831
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,200
you generate know all your usual iocs

832
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,840
which are useful for current trade

833
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,120
hunting

834
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,039
but the most important thing is using

835
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,640
all those information

836
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,679
right converting them into the mitech

837
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,679
framework which basically helps you to

838
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,919
see the tractor groups

839
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,480
ttps their tactics techniques and

840
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,399
procedures

841
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,279
so basically this is where i i talked

842
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,440
about previously about being familiar

843
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,919
the miter tech framework the ability to

844
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,200
map it back

845
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,279
right and use this information to your

846
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,640
benefit

847
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,880
so the tracking hunting group should be

848
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,519
able to do this looking at this i'm able

849
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,440
to tell at what stage of the attack am i

850
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,159
looking at today am i missing anything

851
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,240
right so it could be two ways either

852
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
your team is able to map this on your

853
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,159
own and of course

854
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,360
check with

855
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,480
you know

856
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,039
public available research articles or

857
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,440
the other way around so take for example

858
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,000
you collected this research article from

859
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
so forth labs right so as you can see

860
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,840
here we have mapped the quantity group

861
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,720
ttps through this might attack framework

862
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,200
and use this information to hunt within

863
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,039
your environment do i see these

864
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,679
behaviors within my environment

865
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,039
if they do then i can assume that we

866
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,480
have been hit by contiguous

867
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
and every stage

868
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,559
so that's the type of expertise

869
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,720
that we need within a sock team

870
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,440
so

871
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
basically that's how i like to sum it up

872
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
right

873
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,880
we need a very mature

874
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,600
chat hunting model within our security

875
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
program

876
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,840
right

877
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,320
and i hope this this conversation here

878
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,200
really helps everyone be aware of this

879
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,960
and i hope that everyone know will

880
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,840
basically evolve their security

881
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,799
programs to not just say oh let's buy

882
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,240
the best tools

883
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,760
those are great moves

884
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,679
but i think the another part of

885
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,960
investment is

886
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,240
finding

887
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,559
people right or team

888
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,799
or maybe even an outsourced service to

889
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,960
basically help you out with that

890
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
right because we also understand it's

891
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,159
really difficult to know to to hire

892
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,799
know like really really experienced

893
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,399
people

894
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,200
so

895
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,440
coming back to this question here

896
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,840
what's the hunting maturity of your own

897
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,440
sock

898
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,679
is it at hmm0

899
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,080
no where everyone is just relying on

900
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,159
what the sim brings in

901
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,120
right

902
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,519
or is it hmm4 where your team is really

903
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,039
very experienced

904
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,360
that they are using the sims as tools

905
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,880
not as the main alerting systems right

906
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,720
they are using them as tools to

907
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,559
say okay let's look out for this

908
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,640
information now let's look out for this

909
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,840
particular

910
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,679
track behavior right now within our

911
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,520
environment to see if we are under

912
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,399
attack from this particular campaign

913
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,719
so let's let's go back to that and ask

914
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,399
ourselves this and there no create a

915
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,040
more effective cyber security program

916
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,639
for our own environments

917
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,239
so

918
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,679
thank you so much

919
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,440
and i hope this

920
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
session has been um you know

921
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,399
eventful

922
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,480
and useful for everyone

923
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,960
and yeah thank you so much

924
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,119
take care
