1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,440
hi everyone good morning good afternoon

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,440
good evening wherever you are

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,480
today we are coming here at synchon with

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,400
a wonderful topic around continuous

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
security building security into your

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,279
pipelines now when we say your pipelines

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,520
it might be sounding familiar but today

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,600
we will be covering two aspects from

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,480
different clouds and we will be sharing

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,400
how we can set up the pipeline in those

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
clouds and i have my friend developer

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,920
steve with me

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,480
if you don't know me i'm vandana verma a

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,960
senior developer advocate at sneak

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,879
over to you steve

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,640
thanks vendana it's so amazing to be

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,120
here here at singh khan and in

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,800
particular well just geeking out with

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,879
friends um but hello for those that

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,879
don't know me my name is developer steve

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,320
and i'm one of the senior developer

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,719
advocates here at sneak as well

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,360
so i come from a long background as a

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,960
developer advocate

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,440
and also as a developer i've been in the

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,840
industry many many years i've as a

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
developer i've deployed applications

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,640
from

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
small startup size

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
deployments right through to enterprise

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,400
size

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
deployments in in the past or as i like

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
to think of it in my developer origin

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,840
story

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,799
the one thing i've always been um

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
like i've always enjoyed as a developer

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,600
is deploying applications for with my

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,759
end users in mind if you think about it

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,920
as developers we deploy things or as

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,200
technology people we deploy things to

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,159
basically

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,079
help our end users lives in so many

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,079
different ways from ordering food from

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,520
entertaining from helping people connect

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,119
but the one thing i've always been

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,640
concerned about through my developer

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
origin story even before the embracement

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
of the whole shift left or shift left

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,640
security movement

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,960
was what else was being deployed in

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
these components or in these open source

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,759
libraries or in these open source

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,759
platforms what else was being deployed

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,159
into my infrastructure and if you think

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,360
about the holistic iceberg view that

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
application code that you're deploying

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,360
or that part of the deployment process

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,440
of is literally just the tip of the

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
iceberg above the surface of the

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
internet if you will that's publicly

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,239
exposed and can potentially open doors

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
into your stack

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,119
over to you've been done

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,879
when we talk about open source

65
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,200
is it going to stay here or what it is

66
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
going to happen

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
especially if i talk about open source

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
code that's a huge amount of code that

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,599
is part of our own ecosystem

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,000
i remember like way back when i started

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
my career people used to develop the

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
code themselves except that they were

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,040
downloading libraries from the internet

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,200
which was which seems to be very fine at

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,560
that moment and we were driving a change

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
wherein

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
we wanted secure code review for our

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,319
code like the code which was built

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
in-house and we didn't think about the

80
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,280
dependencies which were there but now

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,680
if we look at all the breaches that are

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
happening or that have happened in the

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,560
past few years

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,879
they're specifically around dependencies

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,800
they're specifically around open source

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
ecosystem

87
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,879
now you must be thinking how much is the

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,159
open source ecosystem 80 to 90 on the

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
code is actually open source code

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
and only 10 to 20 of the code which is

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,319
written within the organization is the

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,200
custom code now when that's huge amount

93
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,959
of code uh is open source do we see the

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
bugs coming in

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,040
absolutely if you see on the screen we

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
have so many languages we have so many

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,480
packages and there are new

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
vulnerabilities which are coming each

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,920
year and open source is becoming the

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,799
huge part of our own code which is

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,959
taking the precedence over anything and

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,400
everything

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,319
and that's why we are here talking about

104
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
it today now if we move on to the next

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,159
slide

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,280
here if you see how many how many of the

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
vulnerabilities which have come into the

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,519
code which are from the direct or

109
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
indirect dependencies

110
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,159
for pi by 89

111
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,200
see that's a huge huge work for the

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
direct dependencies now when i talk

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,440
about indirect dependencies sometimes

114
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,959
what happens is that they are not

115
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,199
integrated directly into a code or

116
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,080
they're not directly impacting it but

117
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
one of the dependencies is linked with

118
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
it and there are many times when there

119
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
are there's a chaining of um a

120
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,880
vulnerability within these dependencies

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
even if you fix one of the vulnerability

122
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
but what happens to the rest of it

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
they're still impacted that's like a

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
huge point part of it which is still

125
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,680
impacted so what do we need to do can we

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
just leave it like that

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
can we just not think about it or we

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
will say it's not my baby i'm not gonna

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
handle it because if we talk about these

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
breaches when they're happening with

131
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
such big companies

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
they can happen with us also and what i

133
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
have seen as a research that one

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
organization even a smaller one use at

135
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
least two to three languages two to

136
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,080
three platforms which are external

137
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
platforms which are open source

138
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,919
platforms and all of us like even my

139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,080
website if i talk about it i have most

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,160
of the code which is open source

141
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
so think about the bugs that might be

142
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,720
there or how if i or how they can

143
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,880
actually impact my website if i don't

144
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,560
keep it up to date

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
now let's go ahead and check the next

146
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,639
site and think about what else it

147
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
actually is going to bring us and trust

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,759
me we are not here to scare you trust me

149
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,600
we are not here to tell you that these

150
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,440
things are bad but here we're going to

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
be discussing how we can actually

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
mitigate it as well so steve let's move

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
to the next slide

154
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
um just before we do i just wanted to

155
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
point out um we we're big we are big

156
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,280
fans of open source

157
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,759
technology adoption and including

158
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,400
contributing back so the thing that we

159
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
find through some of the vulnerabilities

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
that we've been talking about through

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
some of the statistics behind the

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
vulnerabilities is that there's

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
sometimes a delay between

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
the the bug the security vulnerability

165
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
being identified and then it being

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,479
patched and then a release candidate

167
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,520
going out so and to the testament of the

168
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
open source communities which we hold

169
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,639
which we really love

170
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,319
um there's

171
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,160
they're run by um contributors like

172
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,479
they're run by people passionate people

173
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,880
as well just wanting to each learn from

174
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,360
each other and add to the libraries that

175
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,759
they're using so where possible i know

176
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,280
we know that you probably already are

177
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
but i like that highlight that

178
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
contribute back where you can

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
it's just nice to be able to contribute

180
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
back to the community and in particular

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
be able to help

182
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
pick some of the vulnerabilities that

183
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
are identified

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
so some of the ways

185
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,840
we do that at sneak for example is

186
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
through a program called sneak advisor

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
which gives holistic information about a

188
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,440
particular library's health from people

189
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,919
contributing to bugs being identified

190
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,479
and how long they're mitigated and a

191
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,479
release candidate goes out

192
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,720
also shout out to the anyone that

193
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
contributes to the node.js ecosystem

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
vulnerability disclosure program which

195
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
we also help manage as well well not

196
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,400
even just that program but all security

197
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
research is everywhere but in particular

198
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
um big shout out to

199
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
that group because

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,000
this helps keep our end users safe and

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,720
this helps keep our community contribute

202
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
contributions safe

203
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,280
and both programs are a great great way

204
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,639
to be able to

205
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,840
not only identify vulnerabilities

206
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,319
as soon as they're identified by the

207
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,880
security researchers and then also being

208
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
able to get fixes out and keep those end

209
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,840
users safe

210
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,639
now it's hard to imagine the days of

211
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,879
writing software without any open source

212
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
dependencies

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,240
and managing dependencies for a project

214
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
is an important task which requires due

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,280
diligence to correctly keep the track of

216
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,680
all the libraries that we depend on

217
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,759
and after all the applications that we

218
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,240
are deploying bundles our code as well

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,599
as our dependencies so we have a foot in

220
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,840
the door with secure security of open

221
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,319
source dependencies so what exactly we

222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,800
gonna be doing with that and when we

223
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
talk about these open source

224
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
dependencies how much are we trying to

225
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
update that how much are we trying to

226
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,560
cope up with them how much are we

227
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,599
dealing with them that's a very very big

228
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,720
aspect and on top of it

229
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
i i know a lot of friends if something

230
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
doesn't work let's go ahead and check on

231
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,000
the internet and download it

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,799
and uh just start using it and the most

233
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,240
important part

234
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,200
who cares about security and here we two

235
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
people like uh one is a developer and

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,560
another person is security person

237
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,880
seeing together talking together about

238
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
these things because we know half of our

239
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
foot is inside the house and other foot

240
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
is outside the house with the direct

241
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
dependencies and indirect dependencies

242
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
which we have to handle and then

243
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
if we don't handle it

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,839
we would see all those

245
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,680
vulnerabilities which we have seen in

246
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,160
the past and that's one thing but then

247
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
the breaches that comes alongside like

248
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
that's a huge case

249
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,360
now talking about the other slide

250
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,839
and especially cloud native that's going

251
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,160
to be eating up the whole internet

252
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,120
because when we are moving to cloud

253
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,600
we have to manage our applications we

254
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
have to understand how the code is

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,160
written for the app cloud native

256
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
applications and the uh the whole

257
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,279
the base that we are going to be hosting

258
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,399
it earlier what used to happen

259
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,240
developers were only managing the

260
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,640
in-house code custom code

261
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,120
did we change that absolutely we changed

262
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
that we started having a lot of open

263
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
source components then we said oh you

264
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,959
have to manage this open source

265
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,680
component then we said oh now we are

266
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,040
moving to cloud

267
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,440
you have to manage the cloud as well

268
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,480
then

269
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
comes other parts especially the cloud

270
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
native uh the whole ecosystem comes into

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,640
picture and we say you have to manage

272
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,279
this as well now a developer is supposed

273
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,560
to write a code

274
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
good code for the application and for

275
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
the organization subtly they have to

276
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
take care of the code they have to take

277
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,120
care of third-party code they have to

278
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
take care of third-party vendors they

279
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,959
have to take care of cloud native

280
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
applications and

281
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
ecosystem

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
and

283
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
cloud itself i have seen developers

284
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
juggling around it and that's when we

285
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,000
have to

286
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
think from a perspective where our code

287
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
is suffering

288
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
whatever we say our code is gonna suffer

289
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,959
if we don't do it right if we don't add

290
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
security to it and

291
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
if we don't have the right bandwidth and

292
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
strength to do it

293
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,480
that's the major part or what do you see

294
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
just adding to that too and um one of

295
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
the things i've always loved as a

296
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
developer well it's kind of a love hate

297
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,519
really is yeah now with cloud native in

298
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,959
particular with containerization i can

299
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,200
now as a developer be able to have a

300
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,279
yaml configuration file that like

301
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,760
deploys infrastructure with my code

302
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,279
which is kind of cool but at the same

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,600
time it is a lot of responsibility to

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,920
adopt when you think containerization

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
for example

306
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,839
the choosing the right base image to use

307
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,800
having

308
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
security

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,519
set up having a nice secure environment

310
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,920
running alongside of the infrastructure

311
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
with it it's a lot it is a lot of

312
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,560
responsibility to take on knowing which

313
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,720
permissions to set which configuration

314
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,360
to have in place and also which base can

315
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
components to have installed with a

316
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,399
container

317
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,959
at the base image level if you think of

318
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,920
docker for example there's over 242

319
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,880
billion

320
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,279
container downloads from docker hub to

321
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,839
date which is phenomenal and from the

322
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,560
development side of view side of things

323
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,800
i can deploy build in a containerized

324
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,120
environment locally and then use that to

325
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,600
be able to deploy onto infrastructure

326
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,399
with elasticity which is great because

327
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,560
ultimately we build these applications

328
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
and deploy onto infrastructure with the

329
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
idea that we're basically going to be

330
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
building an amazing application that

331
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
gets a super fast adoption

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,079
with alongside that you can basically

333
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,079
have infrastructure that scales as you

334
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,240
need it to so gone are the days of

335
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,800
building um the super big monoliths and

336
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720
then having to deal with mitigate

337
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,480
mitigating traffic through a multiple of

338
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,040
servers this infrastructure grows as you

339
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,519
need it to

340
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
and if we talk about containers

341
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
containers are again becoming big part

342
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
of our ecosystem they seem to be very

343
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,519
small but i have heard people saying

344
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,320
that they are securing everything

345
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
and they are taking care of every uh the

346
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
whole piece of application but what

347
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
about security

348
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
and i even the security people have

349
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
heard saying that uh

350
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
containers containers are the most

351
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,200
secure

352
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
uh place for application did you hear

353
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
that scene

354
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,480
i have heard that before

355
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,480
yeah and and fun fact is if we are using

356
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
the outdated images if we are using the

357
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,000
vulnerable images then can we say that

358
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,519
that we are secure no we cannot say that

359
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,519
and that's when comes a big big big

360
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,399
problem that how exactly are we trying

361
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,120
to use them how exactly we are trying to

362
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,639
update them and on top of it are we

363
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,040
using the right images that's the most

364
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,360
curious part that if we don't use the

365
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,920
right images there have been places

366
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,160
wherein people have downloaded images

367
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,800
and they had malwares installed in them

368
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,680
now

369
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,560
you are using a image and that's like

370
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
vulnerable from inception

371
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
where the things will go the things will

372
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
stay vulnerable or you have a nice

373
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,959
application built on but then some of

374
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,560
the components

375
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,279
as part of the container that has gone

376
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,760
uh outdated and there are new updates to

377
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
it and for a year and a half or two you

378
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,519
don't update it

379
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,920
do you think that you're still safe no

380
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,199
you're not

381
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,279
that's when comes a point wherein we

382
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,519
need to keep updating these images we

383
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
need to use the updated version of the

384
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,079
images and the components installed in

385
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,440
that and

386
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
when we talk about that it's not because

387
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
containers make up of like the whole

388
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
ecosystem it's in itself it's like a

389
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,560
mini world in itself so it's important

390
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,360
that

391
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
whatever it bundles up that's secure and

392
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,279
we did an open source security survey

393
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,279
and we figured out that there are so

394
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,480
many uh official container images which

395
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
are actually found to be vulnerable

396
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,360
now think about steve that there are

397
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,959
official images and then they are

398
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,360
vulnerable like that's a very very

399
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,639
tricky part

400
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,880
yeah i know and i'm still finding like

401
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,279
once today like i'm i'm gonna say it i'm

402
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,480
a big php fan um and even scanning like

403
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,199
the

404
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
the docker hub supported php uh base

405
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,480
image there's so many vulnerabilities in

406
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,720
there which i mean kind of makes sense

407
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,560
given what we were just talking about

408
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
earlier in the presentation too with

409
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,000
some of the vulnerabilities being

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,760
discovered in open source libraries and

411
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
dependencies because a lot of

412
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
these can these base images are built

413
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,079
from those same open source components

414
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
that we were

415
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,399
looking at and talking about so the way

416
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,920
i really like to think about this and

417
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,839
again this is about protecting our end

418
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,240
users like as technology folks this is

419
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
why we build these applications this is

420
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
why we build these experiences so the

421
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
way i like to think about this is with

422
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,079
great containerization comes great

423
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,839
responsibility i love that mate

424
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,800
absolutely and then comes the portion

425
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,360
which is infrastructure as a code and

426
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
when we talk about infrastructure as a

427
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,759
code what exactly are we trying to say

428
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,639
specifically if i have to say that

429
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
the the most important aspect in the

430
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
cloud these days is infrastructure as a

431
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,600
code we want to spin up our instances as

432
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,360
fast as we can

433
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,160
and we want to make sure that these

434
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,959
buzzwords which are there which actually

435
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,759
are making up the whole ecosystem

436
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,560
talk about the aws cloud storage

437
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,519
s3 buckets or when we talk about

438
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,920
kubernetes containers all of these seems

439
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,320
to be buzzwords but

440
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
why are we even discussing about these

441
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,160
things like bucket storage kubernetes

442
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,560
firebase deployed applications because

443
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,639
these are now days the cloud

444
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
infrastructure and that has been

445
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,880
completely abstracted in the form of a

446
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,519
code itself like if you need to spin up

447
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,079
anything and and not just anything but

448
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,800
the whole infrastructure use a code and

449
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,440
you can deploy and today we deploy and

450
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,440
scale resources as fast as cold like

451
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
literally in the lightning speed

452
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,120
so uh it it's the incredible power that

453
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
that could actually provide us

454
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,640
a lot of leverage and and a lot of

455
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,119
freedom but at the same time the

456
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,240
mistakes

457
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
within this infrastructure as a code the

458
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,520
configuration

459
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,079
which can create a lot of chaos for us

460
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,480
so all of these things are good

461
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
network access to storage to service

462
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,199
because we want it as fast as we can

463
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,000
but

464
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
it is getting big and big

465
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,559
and when i say that there is a big but

466
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,600
in that

467
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,160
which is actually creating the whole uh

468
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,440
concern and uh think of a situation

469
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,720
wherein

470
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
we are trying to deploy a kubernetes and

471
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,240
then the kubernetes file that we have it

472
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,120
has some crucial security issues

473
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,679
maybe uh the container port which is not

474
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,679
supposed to be open and

475
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,799
there but it's open or maybe one of the

476
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,880
issues with the con with the kubernetes

477
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
is that the that if i had a container

478
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,360
running without root user control

479
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,160
the pod level security directive

480
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
might be able to get work but then there

481
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
are certain concerns with that

482
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
so let's go ahead and start talking

483
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,039
about our demo right

484
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,880
oh so keen for the demo and it's totally

485
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,559
going to work first time

486
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
yeah

487
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,520
no

488
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,400
that doesn't happen and always god the

489
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
the demogods don't shower their

490
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,840
blessings on us it has happened

491
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,280
wherein on the stage

492
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
giving a talk

493
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,799
and my demo doesn't seems to be working

494
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,720
because i just tried five minutes before

495
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,160
and it was working

496
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
so that's like

497
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,120
every time

498
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,440
yeah wait i i haven't seen for this if

499
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
it does happen

500
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,039
uh

501
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,919
let's see

502
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
yeah yeah let's go ahead and see what

503
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
happens

504
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,000
there's there is no fire in that right

505
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,240
so here what i'm going to do is i'm

506
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,760
going to go ahead and create a new

507
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,280
pipeline for you

508
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,240
and i have my code on bitbucket cloud

509
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
and github but i'm going to go ahead and

510
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
start using github here and i have a lot

511
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,600
of repositories which i can use

512
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
and it asked me that every time which

513
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,880
one i want to do it so here if you see

514
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,679
that

515
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,160
i have my own website i have dotnet i

516
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,200
have java so let's go ahead and run this

517
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,559
java phone

518
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
and i'm gonna get this java code into

519
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,600
the pipeline okay i'm gonna go ahead and

520
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
approve and install

521
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,080
it's gonna take a couple of seconds

522
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,200
authorizing me and then that's all i'm

523
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
gonna be in now the first time it's a

524
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
bit slow but next time i think it's

525
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,720
gonna work really really fast now when

526
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,679
i'm running this i want a simple

527
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,559
azure pipeline with a yaml file and i'm

528
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
going to create as a master folder

529
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,840
and

530
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,880
go ahead and say azure pipeline yaml

531
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
that's all

532
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,880
now if you see this file this seems to

533
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,840
be very very simple right but it's going

534
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,000
to go ahead and create an image create a

535
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,200
master and then run some scripts

536
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
i have mentioned everything and even

537
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,080
it's going to

538
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,679
install the npm but here as part of this

539
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,760
i want to have something like either i

540
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,960
can run it

541
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
which i am going to do now or i can add

542
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,840
some code to it which we really want to

543
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
do now especially if i say secure

544
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,880
pipeline we need to have some code basis

545
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,280
now while the pipeline is running i want

546
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,159
to go back and show you that as part of

547
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,480
the whole organization settings

548
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
i can have some extensions

549
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,559
which is going to help me for the longer

550
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,120
run now what are these extensions if you

551
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,679
see here i have a sneak security scan

552
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,039
which is free

553
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,960
i have zap

554
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
zap proxy which is zero dot proxy this

555
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
is app scanner and then there's a

556
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
dependency check which is one of my

557
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,080
favorites now let me show you how

558
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,400
exactly you can install it yourself

559
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
i'm gonna go ahead and go to the browser

560
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,678
store and say

561
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,660
dependency check

562
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,919
[Music]

563
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,080
now here i can see that there are some

564
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,320
of them and it's over dependency check

565
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,760
i'm going to go ahead and get it for

566
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,960
free

567
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,200
even though i have installed it's going

568
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,520
to check whether i have it or not

569
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
i'm going to say you you download it

570
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
started so it has actually started the

571
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,480
other version i had it to show it to you

572
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
i i made sure that this is there there

573
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
are n number of products which are there

574
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
which you can use it and that's what i

575
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,240
do i have these listed here which i can

576
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,320
do that now let me go ahead and show you

577
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,880
that here it's installed there's such

578
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
certain things you will request to your

579
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,760
admin or shared with people here i am an

580
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,240
admin so i can play around with it

581
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
now the most important part is that how

582
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
do you actually fit it into your code

583
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,880
base that's the most important part now

584
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
let me go ahead and go to my project

585
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,559
and here i'm going to go to my pipelines

586
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,880
and if you see that it's already running

587
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,159
now

588
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,880
now i want to play around with it so i'm

589
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,760
going gonna go ahead and go to edit

590
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,159
because i want to have security as part

591
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,520
of my pipeline

592
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,200
now what exactly i was i want so i just

593
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,400
installed a plugin for dependency check

594
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,679
i'm gonna go here mention a project name

595
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,880
say java or maybe syn con

596
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,200
and then provide a scan path that what

597
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,919
exactly the path could would be

598
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,320
and we'll say this

599
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,480
and then if i want to exclude certain

600
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,880
path report format i'm a huge fan of

601
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
csvs so i'm going to put an xml and csv

602
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,320
and then

603
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,799
i want only one found violations

604
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,039
experiment and analysis and then few

605
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,400
other things that i want

606
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
i'm going to go ahead and add to it

607
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,200
now this code was becoming part of my

608
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,320
code

609
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,919
here i don't want to start it in the

610
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,400
beginning but i want it

611
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,120
after the script has run

612
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,679
so i can write any other thing or i can

613
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,000
just put the settings here and even

614
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,400
before once the setup is done i can put

615
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,840
it here as well

616
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,240
similarly you must be thinking that i've

617
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
uninstalled sneak security scan also so

618
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,120
sneak i'll just say sneak

619
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,080
and then

620
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,400
what application container image what i

621
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
really want to scan

622
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,679
testing threshold and then

623
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,080
sneak monitor if i want to run it

624
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,280
now i'll say add

625
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,240
so here

626
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,799
why it has added automatically because i

627
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,840
have already configured sneak wherein it

628
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,919
has taken my api token

629
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,039
and i'll just go ahead and save it

630
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,760
see it says branch master and file path

631
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,919
resource not accessible now you have to

632
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
give a right path for it if you want to

633
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,279
get it scanned so you're i did this so

634
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,200
i'll say okay let's leave it for now i

635
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
don't want dependency check but let's go

636
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,279
ahead and start using this

637
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,360
so here

638
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,320
i can go ahead

639
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,840
strange

640
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,840
create a new branch and start saving it

641
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,840
we can do this again

642
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,480
murphy's law

643
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,720
yeah

644
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,720
you didn't pray to the um democrats did

645
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
you

646
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
yeah i'm ready i'm just gonna come back

647
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,640
here

648
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,520
okay

649
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,320
now

650
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,760
when we do that

651
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,520
we can actually play around with other

652
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,279
pipelines as well like i have this

653
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,919
pipeline which is one of my favorites

654
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
wherein let me show you this i have a

655
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,600
lot of things installed as part of it

656
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
here i have a

657
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,159
vaf in front of my application which is

658
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,080
going to be running some of the rules on

659
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
this pipeline

660
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,039
and then it is checking container

661
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,240
registry uh container revit registry and

662
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,520
doing a lot of things here and here if i

663
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,600
want to add something more i will just

664
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,720
go ahead

665
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,600
and

666
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
go to assistant and go ahead and start

667
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,320
using sneak

668
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,960
here i am gonna be using my sneak token

669
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,799
and i'm gonna go ahead and start adding

670
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,080
and saving

671
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
now this is what is gonna happen now

672
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,279
when i save it it's gonna go ahead and

673
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,039
save it and then

674
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,120
if there is an error i can go ahead and

675
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,760
take a look at it or

676
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,440
i can go ahead and start using maybe

677
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
master

678
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
and go ahead and run it

679
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
so it it actually depends where exactly

680
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,520
you want to commit what you want to test

681
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,600
it there will be times when you will

682
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,159
fail and as i said that demogods don't

683
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
shower their blessings every time

684
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,640
and here i did a lot of

685
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,120
goofs which i checked i did a lot of

686
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,640
testing with different practices and see

687
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,480
there are few which are failing and i

688
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,520
can check

689
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,240
where exactly the issue is i can figure

690
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,960
out similarly if there is a security

691
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,840
issue or if there is a problem there it

692
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,520
will highlight or it will fail the

693
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,279
pipeline so you can decide that

694
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,159
now coming to you steve

695
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,240
um i absolutely love you know i'm not a

696
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,720
lazy developer but i absolutely love

697
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,400
automated pipelines in particular

698
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,120
because when things work well um once

699
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
they're set up and all uh everything's

700
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,960
up and running like you can put some

701
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,799
really nice gate controls in there so

702
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,200
that you run you when you deploy you run

703
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,799
test scripts you run your security

704
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,159
scripts and then if everything checks

705
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,720
out then everything gets played

706
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,799
it's always important to be reviewing

707
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,640
those scripts to make sure they're

708
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,279
current capturing everything and also

709
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,279
like you were showing to that you've got

710
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,960
to check the logs always have to check

711
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,320
those logs because you never know what's

712
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,720
hiding in them they've got always such

713
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,799
handy things to be able to look at um

714
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,440
but also yay i'm so glad that demo

715
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,679
that's an amazing demo um the other

716
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,840
thing too is um

717
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
is all the cloud platforms have a really

718
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
nice uh ci cd pipeline set up that you

719
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,520
can use so it's always so easy to be

720
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,000
able to get something like up whether

721
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,080
you're using um gitlab github

722
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,919
or anything else you might in in

723
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,960
repository land uh the guy love again is

724
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,799
just that getting that nice seamless

725
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,200
automation um up and running but we

726
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,039
missed something very important if you

727
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,720
think back to that holistic iceberg

728
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,480
stack we had the dev environment at the

729
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,159
very top which of course is being

730
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,559
deployed on top of our open source world

731
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,880
and then on top of that we've got our

732
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
containerization and then at the very

733
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,360
bottom of our iceberg the whole iceberg

734
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,480
holistic stack we have iec

735
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,279
which is kind of how our current sdlc

736
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,880
works these days

737
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,320
but if you think about it there's a

738
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,919
whole other component which we're now

739
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,760
also seeing vulnerability start to

740
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,960
surface in as part of that iceberg

741
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,039
that is the development environment now

742
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,799
as a developer i've been developed since

743
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,120
the age of eight so back in the days of

744
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,840
qbasic for those that remember it but

745
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
this one really really really scares me

746
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
because this starts to affect our look

747
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,960
but the local host environment so humber

748
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,080
for example back in april had a security

749
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,240
incident disclosure um this is actually

750
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,720
still on their blog some of the uh

751
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
extensions some of the libraries being

752
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,039
used as part of a brew installed things

753
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,440
for those that use this mac

754
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
was there was some vulnerabilities and

755
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,799
some security uh holes being identified

756
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,799
as part of the ecosystem

757
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,440
which again like that scares the most

758
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
scares me uh one of the most

759
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
vulnerability types because

760
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,720
that's my local host that's where i

761
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,799
build these things

762
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,559
so one of the places that we're also

763
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,840
seeing and sneak disclosed this recently

764
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
but we're also seeing

765
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
the same vulnerability types in

766
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
developer ecosystem developer tooling

767
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,120
ecosystems

768
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,679
um like in vs code for example which has

769
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,720
over 14 million monthly users and 25 000

770
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,880
extensions in its ecosystem

771
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,120
so and again this one scares me the most

772
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,960
because that's my local host that's

773
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,039
where i build stocks don't put

774
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,640
vulnerabilities there

775
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,880
um but in particular like the one

776
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,559
vulnerability we'll be demoing in our

777
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,799
other session uh is a file traverse or

778
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,679
remote file traversal on a

779
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,880
host developer computer essentially so

780
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,720
you can see why this scares me the most

781
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,880
literally this enables a remote attacker

782
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,559
to be able to grab

783
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,480
a password file from your computer

784
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,080
basically which we've actually

785
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,720
demonstrated on a live stream so

786
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,000
anyway check out that session um it's

787
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,399
totally worth seeing uh and also

788
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,399
there'll be code available actually the

789
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,240
links on here as well but come see us do

790
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,799
it because it's so much fun

791
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,760
ah interesting so we're almost in the at

792
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,200
the end of the r

793
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,960
generally we don't want to come this way

794
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,000
but then we have to end so here

795
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,799
we need to make sure that we prefer

796
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,559
minimal images when we talk about

797
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,360
containers and act fast with those base

798
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,480
images

799
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,720
and when we talk about that we also need

800
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,440
to make sure that we take care of our

801
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,279
whole supply chain

802
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,000
and

803
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,399
are we going to have less secure or more

804
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,200
secure open source ecosystem

805
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,720
when we are talking about building our

806
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,760
security pipeline what are we gonna have

807
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,440
we have to make sure that we are

808
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,279
scanning them properly

809
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,760
because if we don't scan them whatever

810
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,720
we do it is never gonna help us

811
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,000
because we had we have the

812
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,919
vulnerabilities in our pipelines and

813
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,679
what are we going to do with all the

814
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,360
thousands and thousands of tools that we

815
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,918
are going to have

816
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,039
totally correct um and again like the

817
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,480
thing i love most particularly about

818
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,360
building

819
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,279
security gates i call them security

820
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,640
gates but you know what i mean but

821
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,559
building security gates into pipelines

822
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,640
is like you can put those nice gates in

823
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,159
there so that

824
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,919
you have those final checks go into

825
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,559
place i mean it's like

826
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,559
launching a spaceship into orbit you

827
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,000
have all those checks in place before

828
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,159
you take off and then you you launch the

829
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,159
website or you launch the app it's kind

830
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,320
of a granular way to think of it but you

831
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,679
know what i mean like you have those

832
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,600
nice checks in place so that you can

833
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,039
make everything make sure everything's

834
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,039
nice and safe and like a vandana was

835
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,640
saying like always be scared make sure

836
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,320
you're scanning source code containers

837
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,799
and infrastructure um just to keep those

838
