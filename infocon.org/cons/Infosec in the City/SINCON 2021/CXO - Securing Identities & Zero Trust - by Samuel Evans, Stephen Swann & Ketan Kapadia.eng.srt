1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,200
hi everyone my name's sam evans i'm the

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,520
ceo of pure i.t associates

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,440
we're a cyber security consultancy and

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,000
advisory with a specialism in identity

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,480
and access management that's a space

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,000
i've been playing around personally for

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,199
the last almost 17 years

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,520
i've seen a lot of change in that time

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,920
business has changed

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,720
technology has changed

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
the way that we work

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,400
and the way that we interact has really

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,079
changed

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,559
but the one thing that hasn't changed

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,120
is the fundamental impact

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
that identity and access management has

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
on securing organizations

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,399
allowing the right access to the right

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,840
people at the right time is critical

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
not to mention how a consumer might

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
authenticate into any given application

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
safely and securely and with little to

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,480
no friction

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,440
we're going to cover three topics today

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,079
the first one being why i am is so

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,440
important

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,680
the second one why i am projects fail

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
and thirdly the future of i am

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,520
i hope you gain some valuable insights

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
cyber security's latest mantra is zero

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,000
trust

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,240
a concept that tells us to never trust

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
to always verify

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,759
and at the heart of a zero trust

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
strategy is identity and access

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
management

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
identity and access management provides

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
you with the ability to manage who

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,799
has access to your business assets

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,680
it also allows you to manage how they

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
get and retain that access

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
and crucially it allows you to

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,720
effectively manage how that access is

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
removed when it's no longer required

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,159
the traditional perimeter that we have

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
been used to which is the confines of an

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,880
organization with everything being local

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,240
those perimeters no longer exist as

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
organizations move towards digital

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,920
transformation including adoption of sas

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
technologies and moving towards cloud or

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,479
cloud migration

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
identity is becoming the key perimeter

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
which needs to be secured these days

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
certification campaigns risk analysis

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
and identity analytics can now provide

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
even greater control over the effective

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,239
entitlements that have been assigned to

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,239
users

60
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,120
over 80 percent of data breaches are as

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,760
a result of weak or stolen passwords

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,519
possibly because over 60 percent of

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
people reuse the same password

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
everywhere let's take one discrete area

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
of identity privileged access management

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
privileged accounts those which access

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
the most critical systems resources and

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,000
data are the keys to the crown jewels

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,040
or you could call them the master key

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,800
typically organizations don't have

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
sufficient awareness of their privileged

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
accounts and privileged pathways with

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
over 60 percent of them remained in

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
blind spots

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
you can have any number of controls and

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,720
technologies in place but with unchecked

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
privileged accounts this is the

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
equivalent of locking all your upper

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,440
floor windows

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,599
and leaving the front door wide open

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
traditionally

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
identity and access management programs

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
have had a reputation for being

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
expensive

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
and unlikely to realize the benefits

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,799
that customers expected when it comes to

87
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,760
a successful iam implementation

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,519
it depends on the customer at the end of

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,480
the day

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
and the implementer who's delivered that

91
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
solution

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,319
one of the things that i've found in my

93
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,000
successful deliveries of im

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,319
implementations is to start with the

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,560
process just because

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,879
you always did it a certain way doesn't

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,640
mean you need to continue doing that

98
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,879
same way customers rarely assigned the

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,360
appropriate people with the power to

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,959
undertake business process

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
transformation in support of their im

102
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,000
programs

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,400
ensure you do a proper assessment ensure

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,120
you have all your use cases aligned

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
coming out of the assessment ensure you

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
have a roadmap do a vendor selection

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
that meets your roadmap rather than just

108
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
going and selecting a vendor that sits

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
in the top quadrant just because they're

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,959
the best doesn't necessarily mean that

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,560
it's going to meet all your requirements

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
customers didn't realize that an im

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,759
solution required ongoing attention

114
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,600
which in turn required skilled resources

115
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
iam programs are a journey and and

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,759
typically a common thing that

117
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
we see or recommend is that

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,800
organizations take a strategic path and

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,400
an approach when it comes to deploying

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,960
iem

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
it is critical that organizations start

122
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,199
looking at some modern capabilities and

123
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,840
and functionality if you look at our

124
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
authentication space today

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
majority of our authentication whether

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
it be personal whether it be enterprise

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
is still based on passwords which is a

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,800
61 year old technology and what we've

129
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
done over the years is to add on

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
additional layer of security we've we've

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
enabled capabilities like multi-factor

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
authentication which could be sms text

133
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
could be one-time password and stuff but

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
all these capabilities really add more

135
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,039
friction from an end user experience

136
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,280
perspective and we all know that

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,600
passwords are not secure

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
and we cannot really just authenticate a

139
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
user based on the knowledge based

140
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
authentication which is a password

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
as we shape the future of iam it is

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,479
important that organizations start

143
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
looking at functionality and

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,919
capabilities around

145
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,560
simplifying that authentication process

146
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,199
adopting a decentralized authentication

147
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,840
flow by leveraging functionality as

148
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
digital signatures

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
which reside only on your mobile device

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
in this way nobody can sort of play that

151
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,720
man in the middle type attack and by

152
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
adopting technologies like this

153
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,639
it's really allowing organizations to

154
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
stop all the digital fraud or phishing

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,080
and all the things that tie back to

156
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,840
things from a breach perspective

157
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,639
traditional on-premises solutions can

158
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,840
now be replaced by identity as a service

159
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
offerings reducing server footprint and

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,759
administrative costs

161
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,000
the migration to an identity as a

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
service offering

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,199
doesn't need to be a painful one

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,400
existing credential repositories can be

165
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,319
leveraged to remove any kind of

166
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,560
migration woes

167
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
indeed the pervasive adoption of open

168
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,360
standards has greatly improved the

169
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,039
interoperability of all these platforms

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
removing the fear of some kind of vendor

171
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,240
lock-in

172
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
integration with third-party

173
