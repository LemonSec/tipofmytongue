1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,240
hello and welcome to sync on 2021 and as

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,480
if you've realized this is a purely

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
virtual conference

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,519
due to

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,400
but um thank you so much for supporting

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,720
us we really appreciated it

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,080
uh i'm adrian uh i run alienate security

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,680
and a little event in london called

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,080
44.com

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,599
and for me it's the three seeds it's

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,558
coffee cycling and cynthia uh i went to

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,160
a hallway in 99 1999 which does feel

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
like the last century

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,960
um where

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,280
i met emma mill who went to royal

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,840
holloway a few years later but this is

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,440
how it all started

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,039
and came about

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,559
uh emil

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,320
it runs the div zero project uh and has

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,160
a new thing called red alpha that you

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,520
should look up

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,559
um he has he still likes coffee which is

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
a good thing but he's also a bit of a

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,000
whip a whiskey hipster

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,879
so

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,799
but that's but i'm sure this is all

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,920
gonna work

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
so in 2018 we were at raffles in 2019

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,479
the marina bay sands

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,479
2020 we were virtual but uh

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
it was really actually still in 2020 a

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,320
special feeling because we were trying

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
to figure out a way forward to cope in

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
these coveted times

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
and sadly due to covert being a mutating

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,640
thing

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,680
um

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
though the vaccination is going very

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
well in singapore which is fantastic

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
we're having to be virtual again in

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,360
2021.

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
um

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,840
we

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
uh renamed the event to synchon

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
after the first couple of editions uh

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
because we felt that singapore deserves

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,079
something with its own name um and this

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,920
is the result

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,880
um and we have a shiny new logo for this

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,159
year that it all got sorted and it looks

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,280
very blank

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,959
we are hoping to have the physical event

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,840
again next year 2022

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,599
and this

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,760
image is a hint of where it's going to

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
be

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
it's also where we should have been this

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,319
year but things didn't work out

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,640
i would really like to thank everyone

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,160
involved

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,640
in fighting coding 19 because everyone

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,879
in healthcare has really

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
worked their absolute best

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
and the vaccine scientists have knocked

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
it out of the park they

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
have done things that are scientifically

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,120
incredibly difficult

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,160
and

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,879
in the year since really pfizer

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,000
particularly found the way of

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,680
making the first you know the first

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,959
vaccine

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,879
they're using the vaccine delivery

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,720
techniques to help solve other medical

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,800
problems so

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
you know at time of war the technology

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
speeds up an industry speeds up during

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,200
covid the whole healthcare and

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,239
pharmaceutical industries have sped up

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,720
now they've had to obviously

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,840
take other concerns

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
during while they've been doing these

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
these things that they've never been

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
bigger targets for criminals and bad

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,480
actors

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,440
in

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,319
on the internet for example so best of

89
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
luck to everyone in those organizations

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
this year again we're based on discord

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,159
because we tried using uh some of the

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,760
virtual conference

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,080
hall technologies and to be honest they

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
didn't really add very much i mean you

95
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
you've got the feeling that you're

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,480
walking something round but when it came

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,319
to it you still had to type in a little

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,560
box to someone who then replied in a

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,239
little box to you and you couldn't see

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,640
the context of conversations with other

101
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,840
people so

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
really discord seems to be

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
still the best tool for conferencing um

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
and maybe we'll have this even when the

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,439
conference is physical next year to

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,040
allow people who can't get to the

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,599
conference to communicate

108
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
um so

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,920
you've got a ticket you're here you've

110
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,798
gone discord you're here and we'd now

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,519
like you to engage on this chord so

112
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
thank you very much adrian for a quick

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680

a little bit as compared to last year uh

141
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,560
and that's kind of what

142
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,280

crazy for a bit uh is we open up a whole

floating around which is called stars

253
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,279
the whole idea of the whole conference

254
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,959
