1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,840
I am going to talk about more physical

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,560
intrusions that I'm doing at work and my

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,960
research behind by the language but also

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,860
other I see it servo holistically so

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,839
it's not only body language but I'm

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,789
looking at facial expressions as well as

7
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:26,279
psychology behind it so let's start what

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,080
are we gonna see it's a little bit about

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,189
me in for psycho paresis group for women

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,460
that I run will see a little bit about

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,910
ascent and what happens when there is a

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,010
lack of it so when we don't have all the

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,780
information that we need about our

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,770
targets then we'll talk about the

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,200
holistic approach an embodiment of

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,480
vulnerabilities we will dive into the

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,559
body language and then I realized it

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,500
since I have very offensive mine or

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,620
offensive thinking I added some slides

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,530
about how to protect against people like

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,590
me or well using the same techniques but

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,250
being the malicious attackers so charka

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,100
I go this question a lot and people are

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,060
asking if shark is actually my real name

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,770
how does it work because I'm using on

26
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,689
twitter i'm using a handle shark ax as a

27
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,780
shark with a indians that's just to let

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,270
people like pronounce it correctly

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,909
so yeah it's shark it's um check and one

30
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,670
apart from being a symphony it's a

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,479
mythical warrior from Bohemia and

32
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,460
basically what she did in the maidens

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,979
war where it was uprising of women

34
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:47,700
against men

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,149
she's social engineer and entrapped a

36
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,970
leader over the man and then killed him

37
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,990
so I think my parents knew about me more

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,430
than I did about myself so I work at

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,610
dream up where I do everything from

40
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,788
research and training to breaking into

41
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,819
buildings it's it's a dream work

42
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,130
this is what people think that it looks

43
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,420
like me being at work and this is what

44
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,430
I'd like to think of myself being at

45
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,920
work I love pirates and I'll tell you a

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,440
little bit about my first social

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,270
engineering alter ego and she was a

48
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,380
pirate queen so there you go the pirate

49
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,310
queen this is my fake ID that I'm using

50
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,280
on on engagement it's for grace O'Malley

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,620
and grace O'Malley was a pirate queen

52
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,090
from 16th and century Island that's the

53
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,180
real her the fake ID is from CCC

54
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,730
conference in Germany me on engagement I

55
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,290
might come into your office looking like

56
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,010
this maybe doing some serve out it or I

57
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,370
might look like this here I was

58
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,980
pretending to be management building

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,750
building management engineer trying to

60
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,140
fix their router that just was like

61
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,440
books trying to connect to a network and

62
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,620
this is me tailgating taking into office

63
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,080
I am also looking at like a different

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
stuff how to get into offices so I was

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,780
looking at UV felt UV powder so it's a

66
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,810
powder that's normally you can't see but

67
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,090
if you shine a light on it you can you

68
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,490
can see the powder so my idea was if I

69
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,120
will put it on like a PIN pad maybe then

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,830
leave it there and come back and to see

71
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,920
the pins that they were using well I

72
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,670
forgot the brush so I used my own makeup

73
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,560
brush and this is how I looked

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,110
afterwards so actually I just note it

75
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,810
didn't work I found out later that it's

76
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,540
better to use a marker so use a UV

77
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,150
marker and that's how I got into couple

78
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,850
of phases so I'm also involved in

79
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,370
community so I'm ambassador for besides

80
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,290
Cairo in Egypt as well as besides Athens

81
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,590
if anyone's as crazy as me I am leaving

82
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,590
early to actually go give a workshop

83
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,120
besides Sutton's this Saturday and I'm

84
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,450
also co-founder of a Parisian difficult

85
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,700
group if anyone is interested to speak

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,900
will be around just let me know this is

87
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,510
another group so InfoSec hoppers is a

88
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,080
group for women i co-created with Saskia

89
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,010
Copeland's we are trying to this these

90
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,250
are actually pictures from our first CTF

91
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,010
as you can see there are men involved so

92
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,720
it's not a one of those group that

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,740
doesn't let men to come we are also

94
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,960
doing buddy system so we are we are

95
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,930
pairing girls and women to go together

96
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:16,150
to conferences so what about us IND in

97
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,430
ideal world we would have all the Ostend

98
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,870
we need right we would know everything

99
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,979
about our targets and idle job would

100
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,840
look something like this you we would

101
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,690
get target defined perhaps a company or

102
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,310
even office we would do our awesome

103
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,260
gathering all the issues as I call them

104
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,289
so fishing fishing fishing all day Shinx

105
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,580
you want choose our pretext from the

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,289
gathered assent and social engineer all

107
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,050
the things but it's not always like this

108
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,020
so in a case that we don't have all the

109
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,360
øresund we don't have time we were not

110
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,760
given the time we need to acquire

111
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,770
different skills so in my case there was

112
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,720
quite a few times where I didn't have

113
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,539
all the information so I need to be more

114
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,600
reactive I need to be able to read

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,580
people so for that I have my holistic

116
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,580
approaches I call it and the first thing

117
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,740
that I think that is really important is

118
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,460
to stop thinking or at least like you to

119
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,979
stop your own behavioural scripts and

120
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,870
what I mean is you going on anise

121
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,840
and you should not think like you you

122
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,510
should not assume based on your own life

123
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,960
experience how to how the person that

124
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,910
you're trying to maybe manipulate things

125
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,580
you should be just using the knowledge

126
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,400
that you've gathered or research and I

127
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,740
see a little bit like a virtual machine

128
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,740
so this is your like a main hypervisor

129
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,800
so that's yourself that's just basic

130
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,340
stuff

131
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,690
breathing drinking then you have

132
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,590
different VMs so in my day to day life

133
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,660
this is what it would probably like so

134
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,950
my own shark a virtual machine grace the

135
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,750
social engineering part queen would be

136
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,990
switched off and I have always seemed to

137
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,470
serve analyzing all the input that I

138
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,800
have for my life but going on a job it

139
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,780
would look more something like that so I

140
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,330
would switch off charka and I would be

141
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,010
grace but still running the same tool so

142
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,130
first psychology reality is objective

143
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,170
but our perception of the reality is

144
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,320
subjective so what I mean right now

145
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,870
there is one reality in this room but

146
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,000
every one each of each of you has a

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,640
different perception of the reality how

148
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,620
does that serve me as a social engineer

149
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,330
well going on job I understand that they

150
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,920
don't know their perception of reality

151
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,250
is different to mine when I'm let's say

152
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,370
walking into a reception I know probably

153
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,470
what they are thinking because I trust

154
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,160
certain way I speak certain way and if I

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,500
am able to manipulate the perception of

156
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,310
reality

157
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,909
I am manipulating their reality sort of

158
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,190
micro-expressions is another part of the

159
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,549
holistic approach so first we have the

160
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,860
microexpression so these are the longer

161
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,060
ones these are the ones that are more

162
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,270
you can easier to spot them they are all

163
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,130
the way to four seconds easy to control

164
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,060
which means

165
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,490
easy to fake so that's not really what

166
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,760
I'm interested in I am interested in my

167
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,060
core expressions so these are it could

168
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,740
be all the way to 125th of a second and

169
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,930
in most cases they are impossible to

170
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,880
control so this is what I'm looking at

171
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
to see what the person is actually

172
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,029
thinking on how they are feeling so

173
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,360
there are seven of them

174
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,550
this gusts is one of them you can you

175
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,589
can see the nose is wrinkly a little bit

176
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:28,660
looks like if something smells bad so

177
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:34,720
that's being disgusted anger you should

178
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,760
be careful if someone has thinner lips

179
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,980
because when you're when you're angry

180
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,710
you pull your lips together so someone

181
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,520
who has a thin lips you can be leaning

182
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,040
towards them being angry but um there

183
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,650
are other things like the nostrils are

184
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,140
dilated because they are breathing in

185
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:59,110
more air fear you couldn't see more of

186
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,890
the white of the eyes and the eyebrows

187
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:09,339
go up sadness it's really important

188
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,890
because I'm not trying my customers or

189
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,820
my targets to feel bad so seeing someone

190
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,910
who said I will probably try to skip and

191
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,150
not money play the person because I am

192
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,400
even though it might seem like it I am

193
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,680
not evil so I'm trying to take care of

194
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,720
my customers as well and it's being a

195
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,380
good good lesson for them happiness is

196
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:39,330
pretty self-explanatory surprise and

197
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,110
contempt the serve

198
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,870
smirk they are universal what it means

199
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,480
anywhere you go they are the same and it

200
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,300
was proven by research from dr. Paul

201
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,260
Ekman I'm not sure did anyone see lie to

202
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,850
me okay one person if you want to learn

203
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,040
about facial micro-expressions this is a

204
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,920
TV series for you it's based on life of

205
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,120
Paul Ekman partially probably

206
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,980
but it's great because they are telling

207
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,819
you about all the facial

208
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:14,129
micro-expressions with like showing them

209
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:17,730
world leaders and superstars making that

210
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,490
facial expression and it's a good way to

211
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,529
learn so now we saw a little bit about

212
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,139
the psychology and the face micro

213
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,699
expressions so was the next part that

214
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:37,529
would be the better language to explain

215
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,040
that I will first dive into explaining a

216
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,809
little bit about our brain so we have

217
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,300
three brains the oldest one the

218
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,040
reptilian brain it was when we were

219
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,730
chased by mammals so that's us deciding

220
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,309
what we are supposed to do where do we

221
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:56,040
chase it do we kill it what do we do

222
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,639
the sorry the limbic brain is the one

223
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,769
that sort of does the action that makes

224
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,259
us then do whatever the the reptilian

225
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,649
brain decided neocortex is the latest

226
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:10,230
addition to our brains it's the thinking

227
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,309
one it's the also flying one so I'm sort

228
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,559
of trying to bypass that and look at the

229
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,050
the limbic brain so I'm looking at that

230
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,730
those reactions I really like this so

231
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,490
these reactions are fight or flight or

232
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,249
like the sharks but this one sort of

233
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,649
explains it a little bit better so we

234
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:34,379
have fight flight there is third one

235
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,649
that was added only 2002 do you know

236
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:42,629
what's the third one if you look at this

237
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,740
little man he's fries yes so fight

238
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,170
flight or freeze are the three reactions

239
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,939
of the limbic brain so what I am looking

240
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,459
for I'm looking for pacifying behaviors

241
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,939
these are when someone is so people

242
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:01,319
think that looking at the body language

243
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,870
it tells me if someone is lying that's

244
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,819
not really true I can either see if the

245
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:09,720
person is is calm and relaxed or not and

246
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,569
that if they are not Gamow relaxed that

247
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:14,910
means that maybe they are not trusting

248
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,819
my pretext so this is what I'm looking

249
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:18,410
at

250
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,120
usually a man would be touching their

251
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,920
their neck so it's to come

252
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,040
their blood flow women are usually

253
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,620
touching a pronoun sternal notch here or

254
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,260
maybe a jeweler that they have around

255
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,940
here and it's basically to release the

256
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,950
the endorphin into your body to come

257
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,250
here or so down I am also looking for

258
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,040
mirroring behaviors so that's the way

259
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,750
that's the being calm and and liking

260
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,089
sometimes what I do I would just talk to

261
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,290
them and and put my glasses up and them

262
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,660
even without glasses they do the same

263
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,490
thing which tells me I am on a good path

264
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,750
so where would you look if you're trying

265
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,100
to decide the honesty of someone else

266
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,480
where do you think that what's the most

267
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,589
honest part of our body

268
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:24,060
ice ice everyone agrees it's actually

269
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,510
feet and from feet up we are losing

270
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,120
honesty and if you think about it our

271
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,360
face so our face is the most lying part

272
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,320
of our body because we are since we were

273
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,510
little your mom tells you oh look like

274
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,250
you're having fun that you're out can

275
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,350
trigger to does 80th birthday or don't

276
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,000
look like this don't look like that so

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,550
we are very controlling over our face

278
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,480
not over our feet and I'll tell you what

279
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,990
are the what you should be looking at at

280
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,579
the feet but also a different part of

281
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:03,959
body so let's start with the feet and

282
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:11,970
knee so the direction of our feet could

283
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,019
tell us what's happening my one of my

284
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,690
games that I do in a restaurant I'm

285
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,660
looking at couples on dates and

286
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,740
sometimes you know how the date will go

287
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,860
if the girl is with feet towards the

288
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,709
exits you know that's not gonna go well

289
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,269
for the guy clasping feet clasping so

290
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,420
that's when you're like this

291
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,810
that means

292
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,880
that person is serve ready to leave so

293
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,790
all these things obviously it helps me

294
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,529
to manipulate people break into

295
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,029
buildings but it's also good for you to

296
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,220
people to understand people around you

297
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,820
or in business like Crossing so if I

298
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,460
would be standing next to you and I

299
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,490
would cross my legs like this what do

300
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,100
you think that what does it mean is it

301
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,040
being closed

302
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,710
not wanting to communicate being nervous

303
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:14,670
or is it the other way around I don't

304
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,160
want to I'm closed I don't want to talk

305
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,450
to actually it's the other way around

306
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,220
because remember the fight flight freeze

307
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,339
if you're in this position you can't

308
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,550
really fight or flight you're so relaxed

309
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,130
that you can cross your legs that you're

310
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,250
if you're just feeling good but if

311
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,550
you're crossing your ankles that means

312
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,680
that your serve like that that's the

313
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,970
that's the opposite way that's usually

314
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,850
when you're sitting like that lady there

315
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,190
so walking tells us a lot about so if

316
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,440
you have if you see someone who's who's

317
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,900
the gravity serve like goes up the

318
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,930
person is very positive and happy change

319
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:08,640
in intensity so you would maybe tell

320
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,459
that someone starts clapping their their

321
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,560
feet that they are nervous but you

322
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,959
should baseline it maybe that's a person

323
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,770
who their normal state is just clapping

324
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,800
very fast with a with their feet so it

325
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,720
depends on intensity that and you should

326
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,319
have a look at that so I don't have two

327
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:36,990
stories this guy knew everybody so I was

328
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,670
getting into

329
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,679
eighth floor building and there was a

330
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,040
security guy that later I learned he

331
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,310
knew every eight eight and a hundred

332
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,070
people in the building and I was getting

333
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,890
into a building in the morning I have my

334
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,680
fake vape so I was gonna go into the

335
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,530
vaping smoking area to talk to people

336
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,900
maybe tailgate but there was no one I

337
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,410
also had two types of badges that I did

338
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,750
a little bit of ascent and but I was not

339
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,850
sure which they are using so I had in

340
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,910
each pocket different badge I got got

341
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,300
into the lobby walking just by by this

342
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,880
guy and he turns to me and his eyebrows

343
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,550
go down like this means I don't like it

344
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,490
and then surprised so I knew that he

345
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,500
knew that like I don't belong there and

346
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,780
he turns to me and not asking Who I am

347
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,590
or he's just are you visiting so I know

348
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,010
that you don't belong here and so I was

349
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,330
like pretending to look for the batch

350
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,550
and I was looking at his feet and they

351
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,570
were like this means I don't want to be

352
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,420
here but I have to talk to you obviously

353
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,250
he's one of those really nice security

354
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,540
guys who's there usually to help so long

355
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,670
story short I bridges his personal space

356
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,220
so I stepped towards him made him more

357
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,970
nervous I sort of he was asking me I

358
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,670
told him that you don't remember me I

359
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,430
was here on Friday lie but I knew it

360
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,980
would make him more uncomfortable so by

361
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,870
the time that he wanted to see it the

362
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,300
batch he just wanted me gone so he

363
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,250
didn't really inspect it and they knew I

364
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,180
was coming so there was a lots of times

365
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,990
when I'm doing this like a social

366
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,840
engineering physical security and

367
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,690
intrusions people as well as pentest

368
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm not sure if you have the same

369
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,840
experience but sometimes they take it as

370
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,330
a game that they have to win so

371
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,280
sometimes what happens the person that

372
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,560
should be the only person in company

373
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,200
should know they inform someone else to

374
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,260
serve like win and be good at the pen

375
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,480
test so I came there and the guy first

376
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,610
thing I'm gonna be talking about hands

377
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,950
in a minute so he was he did like this

378
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,100
and then he's like yeah can you should

379
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,600
can you show me your document so like

380
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,190
pretty much just following the procedure

381
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,550
while like no error but he was like he

382
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,590
was talking to me and his feet were like

383
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,980
he was pretty much like this I'm like so

384
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,960
is he scared of me like look at me I'm

385
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,470
small blonde like there is nothing to be

386
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,400
worried about unless you know so and

387
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,260
then he was actually gonna go in in an

388
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,570
office and the door was wedged and he

389
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,100
took out the watch and closed the door

390
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,550
like yes that guy knew so torso and so

391
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,380
this part of body leaning towards or

392
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,520
away that's another way how to

393
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,140
understand if the person likes you or

394
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,970
not or trust you or not crossing the

395
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,540
arms so in case of arms you're actually

396
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,850
protecting your body or protecting your

397
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,090
vital organs so that is defensive it's

398
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,620
not like the the crossed legs I was

399
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,010
talking about when you're angry or your

400
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,480
nostrils are dilated so it's same with

401
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,910
chest when the chest is getting bigger

402
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,370
the person is in stress they are

403
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,040
oxygenating more to either fight or

404
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,730
flight against going back to this

405
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,830
personal space that's also cultural so

406
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,410
sometimes in different culture people

407
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,260
closer sometimes so that you have to

408
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,450
understand how the personal spaces in

409
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,570
your targets organization or how the

410
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:41,130
culture is like raising shoulders it's a

411
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,010
bit like sometimes they are not sure so

412
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,890
if someone is unknowingly talking to you

413
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,930
raising the shoulders a little bit it

414
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,820
could be a sign that they are not

415
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,330
trusting you so much

416
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,980
reception who was receptionist was

417
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,720
afraid so I got into this company that

418
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,670
had completely new building they wanted

419
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,600
to test it

420
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,990
did tailgate through seven RFID readers

421
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:16,240
I found a way through a parking lot that

422
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,570
I was waiting for doors what I do if

423
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,900
it's women I am pretending to be so like

424
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,060
crying on a phone little bit lots of

425
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,530
stuff in my hands and I'm like don't go

426
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,450
me I told you we broke up and like I

427
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,680
just can't take anymore

428
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,360
and she feels bad for me and she lets me

429
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,750
in when it's a guy I'm always like I

430
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,730
told you not to put the stuck there

431
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,890
who's who's supposed to clean it all the

432
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,750
time so he's like oh that's a like

433
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,980
like just let her go

434
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,510
so I then so I went all the way to the

435
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,460
reception and I found a vacant meeting

436
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,220
room I set up my stuff I connected to

437
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,680
the Indian ethos port starts getting the

438
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,960
the company and then the receptionist

439
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,810
came like who are you I'm like grace

440
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,570
O'Malley I'm and I would deter she's

441
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,970
like oh I'm I'm really sorry I'm just

442
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,150
replacement so she was served like

443
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,680
really scared and I will continue the

444
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:24,490
story with later so arms arms with roles

445
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,440
so that means that they're they feel in

446
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,330
danger you could see it when someone I

447
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,490
don't know if someone ever got punched

448
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,060
that's usually like someone is

449
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,890
withdrawing the arms to serve pint you

450
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:41,130
so that they are feeling in danger then

451
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,560
try to look as natural on the engagement

452
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,620
so someone who serve like afraid and

453
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,820
freezes I'll read that security guards

454
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,490
in in shopping malls that's how they

455
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,370
know most of the the the shoplifters

456
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,650
because they are usually very trying to

457
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,810
look like they don't belong there and

458
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,680
that's how they how they spot them arms

459
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,270
akimbo it's this this one so that serve

460
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,480
like a territorial they're actually I

461
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,980
think it was one of the tips for

462
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,180
speakers if you're feeling and

463
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,520
sure that before the speaking you're

464
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,270
meant to do the arm akimbo to like serve

465
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:28,490
feel a little bit better tattoos there's

466
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,440
a story with tattoos with Simpsons

467
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,400
so I was I got into office where I was

468
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
not supposed to be I was still trying to

469
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,990
connect to to the network and I couldn't

470
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,750
find any internet ports and there was

471
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,730
this guy who was sort of like just in

472
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,690
corner who would not talk to me and I'm

473
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,930
I need a way in I need to way somehow to

474
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:56,450
talk to him so my favorite pretext it's

475
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,560
to do asset ID outlet that makes me talk

476
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,140
to everyone and get to know them a

477
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,480
little bit and makes other thing that I

478
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,750
belong so I came to him and I said this

479
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,370
that's what I'm doing and he was he

480
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,680
still would not talk to me he was he was

481
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,340
just on his computer then I saw he had

482
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,730
on his ha arm at the Simpsons that do I

483
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,590
think it was Bart now Mike what's your

484
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,420
name he's like Simpson and I'm like oh

485
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,160
that's really funny and we like stuck a

486
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,280
conversation about Simpsons and then he

487
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,110
and I'm like I need to connect to

488
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,030
network he's like yeah I don't think

489
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,710
there is anything I'm like do you have

490
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,580
printer

491
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,700
yes so I got there through there printer

492
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:45,620
at work so hands and fingers keep your

493
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,470
hands visible it's if someone keeps

494
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,740
their hands inside it's it looks like

495
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,510
they don't know what you're doing with

496
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,130
your hands so if you keep your hands

497
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,950
outside you're more open and you're less

498
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,980
threatening nervous and so sense

499
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,940
important message again that means that

500
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,220
the person is all perhaps stressed and

501
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,810
that means that perhaps they're not

502
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,950
trusting what is it that you were

503
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,580
telling them steepling so that's what

504
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,430
Barnes is doing that's what I remember

505
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,660
the guy that I was telling you about

506
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,820
they didn't he knew that I was coming

507
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,180
that was the brief before asking me all

508
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,530
the questions he did

509
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,840
like what we have here so the guy

510
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,480
already knew that I was coming and that

511
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,110
that was a sign for me yeah I was

512
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:44,030
talking for touching neck so that's part

513
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:48,880
of the the pacifying behaviors and

514
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,220
thumbs thumbs in pockets could mean that

515
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,630
your have you have low self-esteem but

516
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,450
if it's we call it genital framing where

517
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,920
a guy stands and I think women do it to

518
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,450
where you like framing genitals that

519
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,960
serve like again someone who's very

520
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,100
self-confident yeah and then that was

521
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,200
the story so I remember I was saying

522
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,410
that I will finish the story about the

523
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,540
receptionist so one of the thing as well

524
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,080
with the torso sometimes they will try

525
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,140
put things in between if they don't

526
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,200
trust you and well she was so afraid she

527
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,300
was starting like grabbing stuff on a

528
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,430
table and just putting it between us

529
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,000
because she she she was just so scared

530
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,310
and I was like well I'm doing the audit

531
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,230
and I need the all-access pass like

532
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,580
otherwise I'm going to talk to my

533
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,470
manager and she's like who's your

534
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,640
manager and I knew from from lint game

535
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,380
that he's somewhere in London and this

536
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,180
was not in London and I'm like this guy

537
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,800
she's like oh yeah he's here did you

538
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,890
talk to him I'm like yes yes I did

539
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,380
and I'm like but I still need that pass

540
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,840
and she was so scared she didn't know

541
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,770
what to do well she gave me the pass um

542
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,970
so from what we were saying

543
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,080
can you guess a little bit what the same

544
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,360
guy is doing any different pictures so

545
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,000
we set hands in a pocket and the smirk

546
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,070
on his face this guy is more confident

547
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,200
and genuine although I would agree and

548
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,970
I'm not sure if I'm seeing it right the

549
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,620
smile looks a little bit fake that guy

550
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,940
seems little insecure then again

551
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,950
the genital framing arrogant yeah that

552
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,559
could be it but the open feed is just

553
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,559
someone who is not nervous who's who's

554
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,409
probably self-confident I would not say

555
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:02,299
necessarily ignorant this guy again I'm

556
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:06,230
not sure if I closed mind not sure the

557
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,940
fit looks the same so it's I took it

558
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,409
from internet and I don't completely

559
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:12,529
agree with everything wants to leave

560
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:18,860
yeah maybe the one foot away so

561
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,890
cognitive dissonance what does it mean

562
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:26,090
it's when your body is not in sync with

563
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:31,340
your mind so we can use this as a social

564
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,919
engineers too if you make the person

565
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,649
move in a certain way their internal

566
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,190
feeling is following their body so what

567
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,260
I am doing perhaps when it's

568
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,779
receptionist I come to talk to her and I

569
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:47,029
first looked down on her table so she

570
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:48,980
looks what's there and she looks up so

571
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,710
she already does this this surf movement

572
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,730
of yes of and then I'm using other

573
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,600
psychology where you are it's like a

574
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,610
Christmas tree so you're like lighting

575
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,190
up sort of certain schema in their brain

576
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,740
so I'm using certain words that will

577
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,840
sort of make her think in a certain way

578
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,600
that in the end she's gonna give me what

579
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,490
I need or what I want so let's get

580
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,260
defensive so do we have people that need

581
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,220
to get protected again social engineers

582
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,770
I'm hoping yeah no one no one needs to

583
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,429
be protected okay okay can you give me

584
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,380
your business cards afterwards I'm gonna

585
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,429
I'm gonna come give you a visit okay so

586
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:40,640
I think is really important to count

587
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,840
with people in your networks there there

588
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,600
we are saying they are the eighth layer

589
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,090
of OSI but alright don't completely

590
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,059
agree I think they are the - one to

591
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,650
eight and we are the ones are

592
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,870
we are the architects of Nonna's those

593
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,000
networks we are the ones putting in the

594
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,270
cables humans are the ones configuring

595
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,610
the the the networks we are the ones

596
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,340
building the the applications and we're

597
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,800
the ones using them so we need to count

598
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,460
with the humans in our network they just

599
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,550
need to be just another asset we are

600
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,670
often saying that humans are the weakest

601
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,270
link

602
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,490
but I don't agree what does it really

603
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,830
mean it's just the level of access

604
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,060
because a human asset and your server

605
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,190
probably the human asset has more more

606
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,770
access so that's why they being targeted

607
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,600
not because they are stupid this is the

608
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,120
IBM x-force threat intelligence report

609
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,580
that says the most relentless threat are

610
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,470
insider threats like inadvertent it's

611
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,630
insiders but what does it really mean

612
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,220
they are just the people that are making

613
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,430
sort of silly mistakes and that's

614
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,260
something that we can fight with we can

615
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,950
fight with awareness sessions we are the

616
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,260
ones who can our human assets so we

617
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,310
should note about these guys company

618
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,790
culture so as I said no more humans are

619
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,650
the weakest links and it's a it's a

620
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,810
culture that you need to build inside

621
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,780
your own company we should stop telling

622
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,820
them that they are stupid

623
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,680
we should start telling them that they

624
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,840
are actually really important so

625
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,900
awareness programs one of the things

626
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,460
that I've been studying is how to

627
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,170
implement fake memories and it's really

628
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,350
interesting it's almost stupid easy if

629
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,020
you have sometimes and and and some

630
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,450
other conditions but what did also made

631
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,900
me look at is how we create memories the

632
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,900
memories that lasts it's the neurons and

633
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,810
the information that we are firing and

634
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:02,490
then we are creating more more memories

635
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,010
that are that they are staying that way

636
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,430
so what it means awareness program that

637
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,390
works

638
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,370
so why we are keep telling them our

639
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,580
people more and more ways how they are

640
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,090
how it's possible to hug them why aren't

641
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,040
we telling them this is what you're

642
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,230
supposed to do this is your work this is

643
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,330
how it looks like and anything out of

644
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,270
ordinary there is a process how to deal

645
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,650
with it either contact ID or or contact

646
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,730
someone from security so my point is we

647
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,280
should maybe change the way that we are

648
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,540
teaching our people and that's it

649
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,960
[Applause]
