1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
all right hi welcome to the presentation

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,109
that is now going to be a 30 minute

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,900
presentation because airports my name is

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,639
Dave Lewis I'm a global advisory see so

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,679
for Cisco I'm part of the duo security

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,109
team and I'm here to talk about nothing

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,869
to do with duo security so I'm here to

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,320
talk about data breaches and probably

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,850
helps if I had actually turned on my

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,019
clicker let's see if this is gonna work

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,800
oh yay so I've been doing this for a

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,080
very long time and when I say this I

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,880
mean security in any shape or form I

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,340
have been at this for over 25 years

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,649
apart McCluster 26 at this point and

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,719
along those lines I have actually had

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,579
the ability to have all sorts of jobs

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,440
from being a firewall admin all the way

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,969
through to being a CSO for a power

20
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,829
company and along the ways I've also

21
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,420
suffered my share of data breaches and

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,129
it's really been an interesting

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,469
adventure so I identify myself as a

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,809
hacker and if you have a look around on

25
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,000
Google you'll find out that yeah people

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,070
don't generally like hackers but I get

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,190
away with it because I'm Canadian so the

28
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,930
easiest way to tell a Canadian though is

29
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,250
we're usually dressed like a homicidal

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,780
maniac going across a she device at a

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,119
very high rate of speed so as I

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,740
mentioned I do work for duo security

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,810
which is now part of Cisco but the

34
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,820
reason I'm here is more to talk about

35
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,159
data breaches now apparently I have a

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,590
very hard time sleeping so what I did

37
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,330
was that I went through and for

38
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,939
2016-2017 and I'm now going through 20

39
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,600
18 s list of publicly available data

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
breaches and I went through them looking

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,250
for commonalities looking for anything I

42
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,810
could do for trending analysis and

43
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,090
things to that effect the problem here

44
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,460
was is there was no common lingua franca

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,829
between any of these you would see all

46
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,680
manner of things along the lines of the

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,780
laptop was stolen from the car but it's

48
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,420
okay because the windows 98 laptop had a

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,500
password

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,930
yeah not gonna help you to be entirely

51
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,270
honest and this is one of those things

52
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,009
so as I'm going through there I realized

53
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,180
that there's not enough coffee in the

54
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,290
world when you're going through and

55
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,060
reading all of these data breach reports

56
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,670
and when you're trying to get a thread

57
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,500
out of all of this and you realize very

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,329
quickly that there is no commonality

59
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,280
there's no mutual understanding and

60
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,840
that's one of those things where we have

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,849
to have that conversation we have to go

62
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,920
forward and say how can we do this

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,300
data breach reporting in a better way

64
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,150
and it is absolutely not to cast

65
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,920
aspersions on anybody who gets breached

66
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,020
I've lived through it myself I know how

67
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,090
painful it is it's more of the lessons

68
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,950
learned because when something goes

69
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,620
wrong we can do a lot more value by

70
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,180
understanding that and sharing it with

71
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,090
other people now one of the best data

72
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,220
breaches I ever saw was from when I did

73
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,140
my degree in classical study as an

74
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,239
archaeology that's how I actually got

75
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,470
started before I ever hit into

76
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,390
cybersecurity there was one really

77
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,709
interesting story that I took away from

78
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,500
that was the sack of Rome in 410 AD now

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,930
in this case what happened was is the

80
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,180
Visigoths came they set up shop they

81
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,280
completely surrounded Rome and they said

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,220
nothing in or out within a you know a

83
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,350
few short weeks the Romans had no food

84
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,850
left there were no supplies left they

85
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,100
threw open their doors they demonstrated

86
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,860
in 410 AD that the idea of having a

87
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,720
perimeter based security model was

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,330
fractured and broken and I apologized to

89
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,069
the cameraman because I do move around a

90
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,140
lot and I can see that he's cursing me

91
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,610
already so data breaches nowadays are

92
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,859
almost commonplace we see these all the

93
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,989
time and we go back to 2005 there was

94
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,700
the big case where 40 million credit

95
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,220
cards were breached as part of a

96
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,739
MasterCard data breach and then again we

97
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,690
had the Heartland data breach in 2009

98
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,209
and I remember you know people talking

99
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,579
breathlessly about these events but

100
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,489
these were events that we had no idea

101
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,410
how bad it was going to get at the time

102
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,230
we really didn't appreciate the scope we

103
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,880
were going to get to as we jump forward

104
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,480
in future and a lot of this was because

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,579
of something like this XP command shell

106
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,620
excuse me peak command shell and I'm

107
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,850
gonna be really evil and come off the

108
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,209
stage

109
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,100
XP command shell is actually a script

110
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,660
that was built into a lot of databases

111
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,220
and this was something that was put

112
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,609
there for reasonable idea of managing

113
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,190
the database remotely unfortunately when

114
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,630
these databases were promoted into

115
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,090
production environments we had the

116
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,579
problem of this still being enabled and

117
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,989
attackers were able to breach these

118
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,790
databases and dump all of the

119
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,680
information is the law of unintended

120
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,399
consequences at its best and the data

121
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,370
breaches never seem to go away now a

122
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,440
quick show of hands with folks that were

123
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,940
good enough to show up here how many

124
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,880
people here are familiar

125
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,940
with s3 buckets on Amazon or AWS awesome

126
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,680
okay that's great for those that you're

127
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,810
not familiar these are data repositories

128
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,280
that you can spin up and you can put

129
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,900
image files you can put data files

130
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,110
whatever you happen to want the thing is

131
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,310
with these by default and I'll say that

132
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,530
again by default these are set to

133
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,050
private and unfortunately in a lot of

134
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,180
cases we're seeing data breaches where

135
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,360
their data was correct accessed by third

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,310
parties because they left the door open

137
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,740
and this is not to cast a person on this

138
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,420
is just a one example and another

139
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,820
example and there are so many examples

140
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,100
this is not an example of the s3 bucket

141
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,930
but this is a point that it can happen

142
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,210
to anyone

143
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,800
now it's really amazing that when you're

144
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,710
looking at data breaches and

145
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,850
understanding how these things happen

146
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,850
you really find that a lot of times you

147
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,740
don't really internalize it until it

148
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,230
happens to yourself and I'll be honest I

149
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,240
was very much of that same sort of ilk I

150
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,550
didn't really fully appreciate the you

151
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,380
know the gravity of a data breach until

152
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,670
I went through one myself

153
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,380
and we don't tend to really appreciate

154
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,750
the data itself and the real reality is

155
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,430
when you look at stuff like an economist

156
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,100
data is very much seen as the new oil it

157
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,350
is the new currency of the day I don't

158
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,120
think you entirely bully and agree with

159
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,310
me based on your reaction but this is

160
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,120
one of those things they where

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,660
information is gold and if we're not

162
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,760
taking the time to better protect it bad

163
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,100
things can happen and what slide

164
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,600
presentation would be complete without

165
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,400
the mandatory AI reference but this has

166
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,160
got a reason for this

167
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,840
just before Def Con a few years ago I

168
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,970
have the how do I put it I'm lucky

169
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,410
enough to work on the DEF CON crew in

170
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,660
Las Vegas and we were trying to get set

171
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,160
up and this was a series of super

172
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,570
computers that were set up across the

173
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,710
stage as part of the DARPA Grand

174
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,050
Challenge the whole idea here is each

175
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,460
one of these computer systems was trying

176
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,930
to breach each other in an automated

177
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,350
attack the really amazing thing here was

178
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,810
one of those systems that did win came

179
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,610
up with a vulnerability and exploit that

180
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,040
nobody had seen before so it was

181
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,050
actually able to create something on the

182
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,750
fly and then we think of the mandatory

183
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,710
oh yes

184
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,850
our games but I won't let that go too

185
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,140
long because somebody might have a

186
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,340
seizure but the attackers don't need to

187
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,170
go to that extent at this point because

188
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,570
unfortunately most of these data

189
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,010
breaches happen because of weak

190
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,260
credentials because of patches that are

191
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,380
missing lots of very simple things and

192
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,210
as I went through and I read all of

193
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,030
these data reach breach reports it was

194
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,890
really amazing to see how many times

195
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,430
zero day was not mentioned a lot of

196
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,960
these data breaches were because of

197
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,540
simple things that were missed

198
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,520
fundamentals that were overlooked why

199
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,990
can't we do the basics well as Quentin

200
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,310
said yesterday now Brian Krebs is not

201
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,260
your ITF system nor should he ever be

202
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,880
and these days much more that reason so

203
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,740
this is an example here from Equifax

204
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,760
when they had their data breach

205
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,100
everybody was going on and on about the

206
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,480
particular vulnerability that was

207
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,600
exploited in order to get the data but

208
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,100
Brian did notice something here that

209
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,110
there was a web interface that could

210
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,960
access the same data in 26 different

211
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,640
countries with a default username and

212
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,610
password so the attackers are not going

213
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,070
to burn a zero-day or something along

214
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,420
those lines in order to get the data

215
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,400
when they can just login with admin and

216
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,760
password why do we make it easier for

217
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,510
the attackers so when we're looking at

218
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,850
media we hear about on authorized access

219
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,620
we hear about in their site or threats

220
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,180
we all love to hammer with that

221
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,250
obviously the web breaches but the one

222
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,510
thing that you usually doesn't get

223
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,270
enough attention of the missing patches

224
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,820
now patching is not as simple as flip a

225
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,070
button and you're on your way if you're

226
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,320
working in a shop with ten users

227
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,240
obviously that's simple to do but if

228
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,860
you're working with a shop that is a

229
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,280
scale of 20,000 or more just patch it

230
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,230
simply isn't something as tenable so you

231
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,210
have to have better examples of how

232
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,500
you're going to do this and better

233
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,350
response plans because the breach is

234
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,630
obviously you're going to happen how

235
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,280
many people here are familiar with these

236
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,700
Star Wars movie rogue one okay for those

237
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,560
of you have not seen this movie I'm

238
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
sorry there's some spoilers here but

239
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,610
this is a great data breach movie so

240
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,080
first of all we have the firewall at

241
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,820
minutes they're protecting the planet

242
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
and he's saying look okay I'm not really

243
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,690
sure why you're

244
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,480
here you seem like a valid ship I think

245
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,120
I can let you in but that's when the

246
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,280
social engineering kicks in and they say

247
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,440
oh no no we're supposed to be here we

248
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,750
were rerouted and they're like okay well

249
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,540
send your code no away goes the sequel

250
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,700
injection and they're like oh yes that's

251
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,000
a good code okay that there's the breach

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,080
so the really funny thing is when the

253
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,700
attackers have then gained access into

254
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,040
your environment they very much want to

255
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,870
do is an escalation of privilege so

256
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,580
they're looking for more data and what

257
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,470
they can do to get away with and

258
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,670
basically get away with things but

259
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,350
usually we don't know that we've been

260
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,630
breached until much later and this is

261
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,370
one of those problems is that the

262
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,260
attackers know this and they do get away

263
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,000
with this sort of things because by this

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
point the data has already been accessed

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,910
or worse the egress filtering has failed

266
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,250
or is non-existent and the data has

267
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,030
already left your environment but the

268
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,930
best part of this movie was the lesson

269
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,550
encrypt your data

270
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,930
none of this particular data seemed to

271
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,130
be encrypted they didn't have to do

272
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,660
anything here but this is one of those

273
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,550
things you know yes humor there is there

274
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,130
humor there is there humor is there but

275
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,250
these data breaches are real for us on

276
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,560
planet Earth so back in 2012 I started

277
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,120
tracking data breaches because

278
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,490
apparently I needed a hobby and one of

279
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,750
the really interesting ones here was

280
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,520
LinkedIn it was at six and a half

281
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,930
million records and at that time that

282
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,240
was a huge huge data breach

283
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,550
we flash-forward today we're looking at

284
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,530
orders of magnitude of billions of

285
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,200
records and I'm worried that we're

286
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,630
getting numb to it

287
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,890
now I've list from my own data breach

288
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,050
and this is an example here one company

289
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,670
I was working at where root beer SEC was

290
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,860
good enough to pop a box that I thought

291
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,260
was offline so this was a system that

292
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,330
was put out by our marketing team and

293
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,770
they had promised me they were gonna

294
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,140
take it offline they did not it got

295
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,210
compromised and next thing I know the

296
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,500
phone is ringing off the wall with

297
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,570
various news organizations trying to buy

298
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,220
you know some five minutes with me to

299
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,640
talk about it this was not fun this was

300
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,760
very much a unfortunate feeling to have

301
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,620
to go through but it really hit home for

302
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,839
me how much I should be you know taking

303
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,280
these things seriously now this wasn't

304
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,560
the marketing team's fault for not

305
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,490
taking it offline it was

306
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,320
my fault for not following up with it it

307
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,270
was our team's fault for not making sure

308
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,220
that we followed up with them to ensure

309
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,570
that this box was going to be taken

310
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,459
offline and not just being taking their

311
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,380
names at it they are taking them at face

312
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,709
value and it's amazing where this is

313
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,930
just a WordPress attack but in my last

314
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,240
job we used to look at the different

315
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,200
types of web attacks that we're

316
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,820
happening on a quarter by quarter basis

317
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,740
and this is an example from the data

318
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,690
sets and the reason I'm using this one

319
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,330
without any date attached to it because

320
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,850
every single quarter these were the

321
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,580
prime attacks and the numbers would vary

322
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,250
by a percentage point here and there

323
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,380
number one sequel injection local file

324
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,820
inclusion and cross-site scripting were

325
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,130
always the top three sequel injection

326
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,600
why because it works now we as defenders

327
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,890
have to do a far better job of

328
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,050
sanitizing inputs and sanitizing outputs

329
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,080
and this will help for this go away so

330
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,029
here's a pop quiz how many people here

331
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,570
are familiar with the OS top 10 okay who

332
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,040
can tell me the first time the sequel

333
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,410
injection was on the OS hub or sorry how

334
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,270
long sequel injection has been on the OS

335
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,829
10 ding right from the very beginning

336
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,870
and here we are years later I think it's

337
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,940
about 14 years later we're still having

338
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,220
these conversations and we're still

339
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,899
suffering through these sort of things

340
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,880
this is from a site called information

341
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,529
as beautiful net it does data

342
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,450
visualization and they do it for data

343
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,839
breaches so this was a couple years ago

344
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,290
it's more recently so much so that they

345
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,209
actually had to change the way they did

346
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,709
their data representation for this

347
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,050
particular data set because it was just

348
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,260
a absolute smudge it's amazing because

349
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,260
it always feels like we are trying to

350
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,360
get the data breach it's almost like

351
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,100
every organization out there wants to be

352
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,220
breached I know that's not genuine but

353
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,190
it's really how it feels because a lot

354
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,320
of times we're looking at security

355
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,290
controls in all the wrong ways and then

356
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,880
Joe sneaks out of the room later right

357
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,180
but we're having conversations about

358
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,079
vulnerabilities that we've known about

359
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,880
for 10 plus years that are suddenly

360
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,110
popping everything in sight why are we

361
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,880
having these conversations about things

362
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,320
that we've known about for a

363
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,510
K+ that have suddenly caused us all

364
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,100
sorts of trouble why were these things

365
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,680
not solved this is a question we need to

366
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,510
look and and have an introspective

367
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,020
discussion with ourselves anytime

368
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,550
there's a data breach there are costs

369
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,680
involved there is the cost of

370
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,660
investigating incident you may want to

371
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,100
bring in one of the shops out there that

372
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,050
are going to go and say it was this

373
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,120
particular evil empire over here or

374
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,250
whoever we're mad at this week you want

375
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,870
to look at the cost of remediating those

376
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,970
findings and one organization that I was

377
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,290
at where is showing you that one

378
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,150
particular data breach we've had this

379
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,040
whole list of remediation findings that

380
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,410
had to be dealt with and the person that

381
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,210
was in charge of IT said oh we accept

382
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,050
the risk that did nothing to solve the

383
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,000
problem all of the issues that had been

384
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,640
identified remained long after I left

385
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,010
that company what's the cost to recover

386
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,320
so if we look at for example Sony

387
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,270
Pictures when they had their data breach

388
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,620
and they had their systems scrubbed

389
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,810
right to bare metal think about that if

390
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,130
it happened to your organization today

391
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,410
how much money would it cost to rebuild

392
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,990
to a point where you're now functional

393
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,600
again this is a real painful prospect

394
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,600
you look at the cost of communication

395
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,070
how are you going to handle that data

396
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,300
breach if you are a publicly traded

397
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,940
company for example you have you have a

398
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,190
fiduciary responsibility to you you can

399
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,260
come in I won't bite fiduciary

400
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,390
responsibility your shareholders as well

401
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,340
as your customers to make sure that you

402
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,140
are doing the best job as securing these

403
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,310
things and you need to communicate that

404
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,350
message to the external stakeholders

405
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,240
internal stakeholders and there's a cost

406
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,410
involved there if you're doing a

407
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,620
emergency PR group or your internal PR

408
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,940
or whatever it happens to be there is a

409
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,610
cost involved and then you have to look

410
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,520
at the legal fees as well there could be

411
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,020
lawsuits in a lot of cases there are and

412
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,950
compliance penalties that could be

413
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,190
leveraged these are always fun for

414
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,690
anybody who has to deal with Europe gdpr

415
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,570
I'm sure has got you sleeping less at

416
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,180
night so another one too is loss of

417
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,920
revenue there are organizations out

418
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,360
there like one company that I worked at

419
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,190
in particular where the CEO sent out an

420
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,190
email and this email was not supposed to

421
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,850
leave the company itself this email said

422
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,040
some negative financial information and

423
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,400
then within two

424
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,740
it was roughly seven seconds of that

425
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,690
email going out it had left the building

426
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,780
27 times one of those times went to a

427
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,770
reporter the stock basically crashed 20%

428
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,670
that day these are things that are real

429
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,170
these are things that can happen I know

430
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,170
live them and also you want to worry

431
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,940
about customer attrition and your stock

432
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,160
valuation really interesting sidenote

433
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
here is one of the side gigs that I have

434
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,660
is I work with a boutique analyst firm

435
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,430
called secure OSes and we did an

436
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,860
analysis looking at how stocks performed

437
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,680
after a data breach the crazy thing was

438
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,220
almost uniformly their stocks went up

439
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,890
that is troubling maybe there is an

440
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,730
incentive for people to get breached now

441
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,070
the costs are also ones you may not have

442
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,380
thought of so for example when Verizon

443
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,480
was looking at buying Yahoo Yahoo had

444
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,460
not been forthright in disclosing a data

445
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,540
breach that they had suffered two years

446
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,150
earlier once Verizon got wind of this

447
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,220
that cut three hundred and fifty million

448
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,550
dollars us off the price so there is a

449
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,850
real financial point to be made there

450
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,290
further to that we look at the talk talk

451
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,670
a data breach where this led to a four

452
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,560
hundred thousand pound fine that was

453
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,660
leveraged against the company the person

454
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,490
in charge of security at that it was the

455
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,820
CIO or the C C it was a CIO said why do

456
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,500
we have to do it we are not legally

457
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,140
mandated to encrypt the data and I

458
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,480
thought that was a bit of a misguided

459
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,099
ideal so when we look at Equifax is a

460
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,000
great lesson learned with Equifax that

461
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,040
was very much in the public eye when

462
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,829
they had their data breach so who got

463
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,900
fired

464
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,849
well the C so after four years with the

465
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,089
company and made 11 million dollars

466
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,160
retired actually if you're a CEO and you

467
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,450
can make eleven million dollars in four

468
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,100
years I'd like to know where they work

469
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,970
because I want that job the CIO retired

470
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,120
and I'm sure the CEO is fine oh wait no

471
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,760
CEO retired with a 90 million dollar

472
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,670
u.s. pay parachute and in this whole

473
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,180
thing

474
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,810
who did they blame one guy NIT this was

475
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,380
indicative of a far deeper problem you

476
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,990
want to make sure that you are not

477
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,370
looking for the one scapegoat this was

478
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,960
all a symptomatic of a much larger

479
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,220
problem afoot with this particular

480
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,500
organization and hopefully this will

481
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,150
sand out there as a lesson learned

482
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,010
because look at it from your perspective

483
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,710
your organization what if your entire

484
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,790
c-suite was shown the door or retired

485
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,680
suddenly how would your company respond

486
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,370
and it was not just Equifax their

487
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,290
competitor had a similar problem a few

488
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,350
days later where suddenly their

489
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,630
TransUnion website was doing this due to

490
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,060
installing malicious flash packages so

491
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,920
attackers were good enough to mess with

492
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,760
them as well now when you're looking at

493
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,070
doing security in your own organization

494
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,270
one of the things you want to do is you

495
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,670
want to look for allies there are teams

496
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,620
out there that can help you get your job

497
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,070
done compliance is a great example the

498
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,810
compliance team which is one that I'll

499
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,180
have to be purely honest I used to

500
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,730
derive myself are a group of people that

501
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,950
can very much help you build bridges

502
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,450
within other parts of the organization

503
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,940
mmm they can help you go go through

504
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,460
mm-hmm excuse me they can help validate

505
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,160
your own plans they can help you look at

506
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,600
things from a different perspective that

507
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,300
you mean not of Lois looked at before

508
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,250
because mistakes are gonna happen in the

509
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,020
strangest places so when these mistakes

510
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,520
happen you want to make sure you have

511
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,680
these allies so this is a story we're

512
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,210
back in the 90s I was working for a

513
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,740
defense contractor in the United States

514
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,330
and it was odd and odd that they let a

515
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,030
Canadian and but I was okay with it I

516
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,180
got really mad because the client site

517
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,590
that I was working on was constantly

518
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,360
being attacked by this one particular IP

519
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,330
address so one day after no sleep

520
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,010
because that's the way I did things back

521
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:50,350
then I went after them I hacked back

522
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,580
so this is an example of why you should

523
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,590
never hack back especially when you're

524
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,840
sleep-deprived when I went after this

525
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,400
site I got into their systems

526
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,260
I left a note for them because I wasn't

527
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,240
gonna tear everything down and I said

528
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,830
look these are the issues that I found

529
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,510
with your particular site and also I'd

530
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,860
appreciate if you would stop attacking

531
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,299
our site and they left a burn or email

532
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,020
address and then I left feeling very

533
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,179
proud of myself I thought okay I've done

534
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,730
a wonderful thing here yeah a couple

535
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,460
days later I got an email they said wow

536
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,929
thank you very much for the list of

537
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:24,309
things that you found we've been able to

538
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:25,570
remediate that and we really do

539
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,320
appreciate it

540
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,330
but we just wanted to point out that you

541
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,230
missed one octet in your IP address what

542
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,730
I had in fact transposed a couple of

543
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,260
numbers and I had gone after somebody

544
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,280
totally different but they were

545
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,049
appreciative and that could have gone

546
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:44,320
very much of a different way so here I

547
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,820
am thinking that I'm hitting back

548
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,740
against the attacker when inadvertently

549
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,450
I've gone after some totally innocent

550
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,450
third party this is just a great example

551
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,720
of why hack back never works because

552
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,030
mistakes are gonna happen and it's not

553
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,730
just me this was a great example here

554
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,770
where I had a vulnerability scanning

555
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,750
vendor who will remain nameless said

556
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,940
look we're gonna scan your entire IP a

557
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,340
block will give you a sample report so

558
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,510
you can see how it is so you can buy our

559
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,179
product and I went okay full block great

560
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:14,770
I was working for a power company at the

561
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,530
time and we dealt in class bees so I

562
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,880
said yeah here's our class bee and they

563
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,159
went oh we were kind of hoping for a

564
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,750
Class C and like we don't do that

565
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,409
so I got this report a few days later

566
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,020
and they printed it it was about this

567
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,150
thick and they said here you go and they

568
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,380
were all very proud of themselves and

569
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,150
I'm flipping through it and I'm looking

570
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,770
at these things I'm like there's a lot

571
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,440
of printers in here there's a lot of

572
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,370
printers in Shanghai in Beijing and I'm

573
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,440
like we don't have operations

574
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,440
oh no they had done the same thing that

575
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,960
I did years earlier they had transposed

576
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,730
part one octet and the IP address space

577
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,280
and they had gone after an entire block

578
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,830
in China so I'm like congratulations

579
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,530
you've just committed an act of digital

580
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,380
warfare so they were really really

581
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,620
feeling bad about it super apologetic

582
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,779
I did learn very quickly that printers

583
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:09,450
are a serious issue in China but these

584
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,090
mistakes are gonna happen and we have to

585
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,130
learn how to take these as lessons and

586
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,779
share them with others to make sure they

587
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:18,120
don't do the same mistakes and these

588
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,610
lessons are many this is a great example

589
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,679
I was working for a Power Company where

590
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:23,970
they had this application that was

591
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,980
promoted into production and when they

592
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,519
did this they had bypassed security they

593
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,230
we were the gate part of the gating

594
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,909
process to make sure that it was vetted

595
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:34,799
before applications promoted into

596
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,809
production so this is not the actual

597
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:38,700
website this is just an example where I

598
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,720
did view source right there right there

599
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,760
just so we make sure were perfectly

600
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,620
clear this was how I looked at their web

601
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,789
application because this is the first

602
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:49,409
thing I did when I finally got to look

603
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,600
at it this was the reaction of the

604
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,250
application manager when I showed them

605
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,139
what I found in the source code and when

606
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:01,260
I say source code I mean HTML commented

607
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,159
out in the HTML was admin and password

608
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,370
and I tried it and it worked from their

609
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,049
administrative page I was able to gain

610
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:11,880
full access so we took that offline very

611
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,820
quickly now my first reaction was one of

612
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,909
absolute disdain but I made sure that I

613
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,519
didn't blow my foot off because this was

614
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:23,340
an example where I had not taken the

615
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,820
time to impart to them the security

616
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,960
requirements that we had to make sure

617
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,669
that an application was safe and secure

618
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,950
before it went online so this was a

619
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,289
lesson learned for ourselves where in

620
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,059
order to avoid a data breach we have to

621
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,380
make sure that we're communicating this

622
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,240
information forward because I really

623
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,470
couldn't get mad at them because we

624
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,360
never had that conversation they did

625
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,710
what they were good at was writing an

626
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,600
application but at no point that anybody

627
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,269
communicate that to him safely fix that

628
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,519
one after the fact but sometimes you'll

629
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,990
fix things and you'll find out much

630
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,269
later that yeah they didn't stay fixed

631
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,909
one company that I left well this

632
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:01,710
happened a co-worker sent me an email

633
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,179
said you're not going to believe this

634
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,649
remember that server that you picked

635
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:06,779
fixed before you left I said yeah the

636
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,399
one where we had you know 72 meetings in

637
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,649
order to get done yeah well they renamed

638
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,379
it so this particular URL if you put the

639
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:14,760
right at the end

640
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,490
slash at C password

641
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,350
that was publicly available to anybody

642
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,070
who wanted to look this is a frustration

643
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,810
that you have to be aware of that even

644
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,220
when you fix things sometimes they'll

645
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,070
get undone because people very often use

646
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,350
tools and use things in a way that you

647
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,960
just don't expect or sometimes they'll

648
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
ask for things that just don't work

649
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,150
because these data breaches can happen

650
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,520
literally to anyone the first time I

651
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,080
ever gave this talk this particular

652
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,610
company here and this is not to

653
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,590
disparage them but this literally was an

654
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,240
hour before I gave this talk the very

655
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,370
first time their entire database was

656
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,050
dumped on to the site my friend Bob Lord

657
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,550
put it very well in that he described a

658
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,870
data breach as going through a state of

659
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,880
verdict oh and I agree with him

660
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,140
completely when I went through my own

661
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,940
data breach I didn't know if I was

662
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,110
coming or going I didn't sleep for

663
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,840
several days now the thing was there was

664
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,790
only 192 accounts on there none of them

665
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,380
are actually existing anywhere in our

666
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,230
enterprise it was only reputational risk

667
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,260
a reputational damage in that case but

668
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,530
still it really really stung and

669
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,330
mistakes will happen the Morris worm is

670
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,080
a great example

671
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,500
it was code that was released apparently

672
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,150
accidentally it was never supposed to do

673
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,280
what they the author had intended yet it

674
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,310
caused all sorts of damage

675
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,110
now as a security professional we tend

676
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,320
to look at everything as a tactical

677
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,070
response we are never really paying and

678
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,230
paying enough to tension to the strategy

679
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,750
we tend to be very tactical and we also

680
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,300
tend to align against ourselves and in

681
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,460
many cases we eat our own so somebody in

682
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,660
the security profession does something

683
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,520
wrong we tend to gang up on them and

684
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,050
this is something we need to stop doing

685
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,340
collectively because we need allies

686
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,050
another ally is the audit team within

687
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,390
your own company now I worked at one

688
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,910
bank and it was fantastic and I say that

689
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,980
very tongue-in-cheek the audit team

690
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,610
literally were trying to have how they

691
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,190
put it my Pelt on a wall they wanted to

692
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,020
tear me down because I was leading a

693
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,780
security team and they bail built out

694
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,260
their metrics based on how many times

695
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,660
they found something we did wrong

696
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,700
I've made it I made it my purpose to sit

697
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,710
down with them and say look how do we

698
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,040
make this so it's a mutually beneficial

699
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,750
conversation he was so caught off-guard

700
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,670
by this that he actually sat back in his

701
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,110
chair and stared at me for a moment and

702
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,030
then said I had never thought of it that

703
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,280
way he had literally always thought of

704
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,230
it as taking out my team and I was like

705
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,610
this is not going to further the

706
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,560
conversation so we were able to sit down

707
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,870
have these sort of conversations and he

708
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,640
was able to help by testing our reach

709
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,110
and incident response plan which I'm

710
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,810
sure everybody in this room has look at

711
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,250
the risks and benefits of information

712
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,900
sharing within our own organization as

713
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,090
well as other organizations that were in

714
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,360
a similar market space and well that

715
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,740
compliance is off in the adult in the

716
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,990
room but so is audit which is a typo

717
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,970
because when you're having these

718
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,530
conversations and you have these allies

719
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,510
within your own organization you are

720
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,120
better suited to give the bad news when

721
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
it happens because the bad news is gonna

722
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,850
come eventually and you have to really

723
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,700
focus on not so much the zero day but

724
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,100
the hundred day my favorite example our

725
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,820
sequel quarterly patch releases or sorry

726
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,070
sequel sorry Oracle patch releases that

727
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,190
come out every quarter and invariably

728
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,200
when I would speak to a DBA I said well

729
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
when's the last time you applied these

730
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,160
on these level two years ago and it's

731
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,950
like but what about the other ones it's

732
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,910
like oh it's okay we have a firewall I

733
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,470
wish I could was joking but that's just

734
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,020
it it happens over and over again it'll

735
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,360
happen in your own organization and I

736
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,850
see some nodding heads so what do you do

737
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,460
you've got to start where you are you

738
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,110
have to look at building out a risk

739
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,240
register in order to understand what

740
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,590
those risks are within your own

741
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,900
organization you have to be able to go

742
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,820
through and say these are the things

743
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,830
that we need to address and build out a

744
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,890
mitigation plan for all of these because

745
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,810
patching is not as simple as just

746
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,910
flipping a switch and saying okay we're

747
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,160
done it really isn't if you're in a

748
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,050
10-person shop sure that's manageable

749
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,690
but very much like Quentin mentioned

750
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,430
yesterday during the cxo panel if you're

751
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,170
dealing with a shop of twenty thousand

752
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,290
or scaling above it's not that easy and

753
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,500
we need to start looking at how we stop

754
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,250
threats

755
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,100
earlier how do we protect using you know

756
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,350
making sure that we're looking at DNS as

757
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,600
a great example we're looking at how

758
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,130
we're doing our patch cycle how we're

759
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,900
doing that work zone segmentation within

760
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,240
our own organization one company I

761
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,370
worked at years ago I was able to sit at

762
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,310
my desk in Toronto and I could query

763
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,500
directly systems in our offices in

764
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,530
Malaysia but there was nothing in

765
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,090
between and there was also no logging to

766
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,450
show where I was coming from we need to

767
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,300
build out better security paradigms in

768
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,100
order to make sure did I just say

769
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,900
paradigms I'm gonna go sit in my shame

770
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,180
closet we need to build out better

771
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,190
structures because we're constantly

772
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,620
being asked to innovate and it's very

773
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,330
difficult to innovate when the plane has

774
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,730
already taken off when you are trying to

775
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,270
build that plane in flight and things

776
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,370
are going to happen but these war

777
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,050
stories are the ones you need to learn

778
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,780
from and one organization that I worked

779
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,900
for it was amazing we had organizations

780
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,970
in North America RIA and MPAA that

781
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,350
showed up and they were very angry with

782
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,910
us because we were downloading all sorts

783
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,370
of movies and files and they said you

784
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,540
know we're gonna find you if you don't

785
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,470
fix this

786
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,420
what on earth are you talking about and

787
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,700
they showed us where they were allegedly

788
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,290
being done and we thought this is very

789
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,290
odd because the information they had did

790
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,840
not mention or did not measure up with

791
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,970
our office in Southeast Asia and the

792
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,910
logs simply didn't measure up we had

793
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,410
somebody local in the region who flew

794
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,120
over to that particular country and had

795
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,160
a look and it found out that the folks

796
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,200
in that office had built a stub Network

797
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,560
off the perimeter router so lesson

798
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,850
learned on our part we were looking at

799
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,410
the firewall logs but the router logs

800
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,390
apparently we weren't collecting at that

801
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,550
particular location so they had actually

802
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,020
put a tap in between and created their

803
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,250
own network and they were downloading

804
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,300
movies and files so sometimes something

805
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,390
that looks very bad can also be a great

806
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,890
lesson because you're able to take that

807
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,980
and move on in a better way because

808
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,510
these gotchas are gonna happen in places

809
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,000
you don't expect and one power company I

810
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,650
was working at it was usually usually

811
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,810
used to be part of one large company but

812
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,130
even split into five separate

813
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,740
organizations we had this weird routing

814
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,270
error nobody could understand it so we

815
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,190
went out to did what you know techies do

816
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,690
we went out onto the race

817
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,030
Flor and we got the tile lifter and tile

818
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,590
number one no nothing there

819
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,800
tile number two no nothing there Terrell

820
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,640
number three Hey hi there was a Cisco

821
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,710
1750 blinking back at us from under the

822
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,210
floor that nobody knew what it was doing

823
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,370
there nobody understood what it was

824
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,120
after several hours of phone calls and

825
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,760
doing all sorts of analysis it turned

826
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,800
out that that was actually a connection

827
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,810
back to one of the other companies of

828
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,180
the original five from back in the day

829
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,280
when it was one symbol one whole company

830
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,620
now with that connection that was

831
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,330
something that was legitimate at one

832
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,400
point in time but now it was connected

833
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,750
to what was ostensibly our competitor

834
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,310
thankfully they didn't know it was there

835
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,140
either so they were just as embarrassed

836
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,670
as we were and we were able to take that

837
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,830
out before it was a real problem but

838
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,690
that's just it these things are gonna

839
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,580
happen so you have to make sure that you

840
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,650
have a clear mitigation plan in place in

841
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,380
order to address these things and if you

842
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,200
ever ever have trouble sleeping go read

843
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,930
