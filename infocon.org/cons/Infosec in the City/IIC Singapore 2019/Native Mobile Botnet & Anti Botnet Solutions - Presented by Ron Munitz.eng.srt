1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
good afternoon everyone and thank you

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,120
for coming here my name is Ron rowitz I

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,450
am leading the PSC G and PSEG holding is

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,130
a cup of company to do all kinds of

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,540
things

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,560
basically the PSEG Holdings is

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,810
developing a couple of ventures and one

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,910
of them is related in this way or

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,220
another to what I'm going to present

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,130
that is let's say mobile botnets

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,650
techniques and anti techniques let's put

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,140
it this way and the other thing that

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,850
I've been running for the last couple of

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,000
years is actually a services company

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,320
that does embedded consulting and

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,250
training for basically everything that

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,800
is Android iOS IOT embedded and related

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,600
so we do a lot of things security

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,340
apparently is our main business and

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,520
about honestly it's just a side product

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,159
at least from my perspective and for

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,170
more or less understanding operating

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,270
system hopefully much more than less

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,600
okay and so this is what we do we do

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,520
training with all kind of stuff we have

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,320
nice customers hopefully we'll have

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,860
someone it's nice customer and basically

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,009
our services company funds and the

29
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,700
ventures we are doing so it's pretty

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,670
nice to work with us all right so this

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,610
stock is quiet informal so please feel

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,939
free to interrupt it every every second

33
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,180
that you might want and a lot of the

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,680
topics as opposed to my regular talks

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
are less technical and less in details I

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,320
mean here is a proof I'm away from the

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,450
computer this doesn't happen talk of

38
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,009
mine as you can know like from yesterday

39
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,460
look something like this sometimes in

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,909
their very relaxed face sometimes people

41
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,740
are dead like during the talk because

42
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,899
there's so much information not enough

43
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,490
time when we need like to run like crazy

44
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,949
okay so please feel free and

45
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,400
let's begin with our topics so

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,930
essentially I'm going to talk about two

47
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,180
kinds of things and I'm going to talk

48
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,640
about enterprise and the so-called old

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,489
world and when I talk about it I don't

50
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,410
mean necessarily that things that don't

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,459
happen today but I talk about computers

52
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,500
desktop computers servers laptops

53
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,269
everything that is not mobile because it

54
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:37,180
is one ecosystem that is interesting and

55
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,760
the reason why I'm going to focus on it

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,769
because speaking of like time that

57
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,480
products both offensive and defensive

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,349
had to actually you know make it back to

59
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,410
the market and have not necessarily good

60
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,170
solutions but solutions that sell there

61
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,819
has been a lot of time for that and for

62
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,319
everything that has to do with botnets

63
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,780
in the desktop world or in the server

64
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,940
world then there are gazillion of

65
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,739
companies that have products and they

66
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,190
sell and some of them do very good job

67
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,389
in many things so I separate it and

68
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:16,120
because in the mobile landscape some of

69
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,060
the things are like very new I can tell

70
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,350
you from experience that up until 2007

71
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,840
16 or 17 like nobody even addressed what

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,359
is called the native mobile landscape

73
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,459
and later on when they did address it

74
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,430
people do very very very bad work and

75
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,930
believe me that I know because I help

76
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,030
companies to evaluate some of their

77
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,850
providers and so we start with the

78
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,170
enterprise world and essentially later

79
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,230
we're going to talk about a de Mobile or

80
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,400
so first of all speaking about frauds in

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,380
the enterprise world then the motivation

82
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,049
for anti fraud solutions is quite

83
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,569
obvious we want to avoid all kind of

84
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,139
like money stealing all kind of like

85
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,310
reputation problems and all kind of

86
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,230
other things like that and we are

87
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,049
talking about reputation problem then we

88
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,510
mean that let's say that if somebody

89
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,329
steals a credit card let's say or uses a

90
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,130
service that is authorized to someone

91
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,170
and it does it like in a non legit way

92
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,770
then even if there are no money problems

93
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,270
even if there is insurance and then it's

94
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,560
problem of the insurance company and

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,290
even if everything seems like okay then

96
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,840
there can be like very very bad

97
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,640
implications to this kind of thing

98
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,440
so actually one needs to be able to

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,170
moderate and protect against all kind of

100
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,420
fraud in this thing which is quite quite

101
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,080
quite obvious and the question now

102
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,730
becomes what is like the threat modeling

103
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,600
so if there is like this a hacker kid or

104
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
script kiddie or whoever I already

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,010
wanted to call it I'll try to be more

106
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,590
formal because we're videoed now usually

107
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,020
I would go and in some places that are

108
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,570
like with brackets and are supposed to

109
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,820
be sensor eyes I would go and like say

110
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,560
things that I'm super not supposed to be

111
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,510
saying but I would try to avoid it

112
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,160
although it makes talks a lot more

113
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,370
interesting and so basically when we

114
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,440
talk about this script Kitty or about

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,380
this single person then the question is

116
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,750
if organization should even care about

117
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,910
it sometimes yes in like 99.9% of the

118
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,610
cases if it's not like a very well

119
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,890
scaled attack nobody cares

120
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,570
it's not even worse than money of an

121
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,310
organization to protect against okay

122
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,610
like this is life so with the questions

123
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,440
always like in threat modeling is like

124
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,440
okay what are the risks how much it

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,070
costs to if like I get great let's say

126
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,920
how much it costs if to actually have a

127
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,780
solution that prevents against it and

128
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,210
then we see like we do the trade-offs

129
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,960
and see if it's interesting or not now

130
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,380
basically 99% of the cases not we don't

131
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,810
care there is a problem no worries let's

132
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,220
pay end of story

133
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,750
what do we need all kind of security

134
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,550
companies let them go and play with the

135
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,240
murder so bottom line is that if attack

136
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,300
is like not on a high scale it's not

137
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,840
interesting period okay so speaking of

138
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,930
the enterprise world required of

139
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,430
solution that exists in all kind of like

140
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,620
terminologies and solutions will be

141
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,129
highlighted in green

142
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,899
slides are not so beautiful but the

143
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,839
colors are like very clear so you can

144
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,059
see for example all kinds of like okay

145
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,769
let's see if there is even something

146
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,289
that's going on right like ideas and

147
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:42,749
then like preventing them they're going

148
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,519
to be all kind of okay let's go and try

149
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,099
to trick them and like identify if there

150
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,169
is a problem and not have like the real

151
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,439
servers breached so honey pots there are

152
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,599
all kind of systemic behavioral and

153
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:55,919
statistical analysis

154
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,869
aka cyber ml aai cyber all this kind of

155
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,269
stuff cyber cyber cyber cyber cyber you

156
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,339
know billion percent of the companies

157
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,909
would say we do AI cyber security III

158
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:11,039
machine learning secure so this is

159
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,099
systemic of behavioral and statistical

160
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,009
analysis okay like this is the truth and

161
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,129
then all kind of like solutions that are

162
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,349
going to actually you know be preventive

163
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,099
let's even see if there are problems or

164
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,829
after it like incident response and they

165
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:31,739
are also actually you know actually

166
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,599
especially like in Singapore for example

167
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,389
there are many many many things that can

168
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,929
be prevented by our governance by

169
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:42,719
regulation by simply controlling let's

170
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:47,099
say the traffic medium let's put it this

171
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,949
way and for example preventing things

172
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,139
I'll give you an example I saw some

173
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,269
people from grab the other day anybody

174
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:58,949
here's works for grab maybe no so an

175
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,229
example for this like okay we are afraid

176
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,689
in grab that people would register to

177
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,789
our app with all kinds of fake credit

178
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,089
cards before arriving Singapore so you

179
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,149
can see is an extern ow sorry that you

180
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,429
can't even like pay with credit card or

181
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:15,839
register if you're not physically in

182
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,909
Singapore like the application behaves

183
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:19,469
completely differently like if you're

184
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:22,050
inside or not inside now I'm not here to

185
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,079
analyze anyone's security like Motors or

186
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,659
solution but it is a fact and it is a

187
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:29,519
fact can that can help you mitigate at

188
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,328
least some kinds of like attacks like we

189
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:35,309
don't care about people that are not in

190
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,599
Singapore

191
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,909
and once you're in Singapore yes you can

192
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,099
pretty much reliably identify if

193
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,259
communication is coming from inside or

194
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,630
from outside technically speaking you

195
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,670
know if you have controlling all their

196
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,149
routers in the country which there is

197
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,579
but presumably I don't know but I

198
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,380
believe so there you have no reason to

199
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,300
believe otherwise then you are all

200
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,860
covered everything is good and you can

201
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,750
cut a lot of like outside your attacks

202
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,970
and like concentrate on whatever is in

203
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,759
your country so this probably applies to

204
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,889
a lot of other techniques that I'm going

205
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,170
to talk about also but the world is not

206
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,730
just Singapore okay unfortunately and so

207
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,839
another interesting vector is actually

208
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,509
all kind of things of like okay so we

209
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,339
are like a bank at least in my country

210
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,459
it surprisingly works like this like all

211
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,160
the parks are using terminal services

212
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,029
like Citrix and solutions like that and

213
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,279
which is actually what I offered my

214
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,079
previous startup and the data

215
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,149
virtualization of Android and what we

216
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,029
offer now as a platform be happy to talk

217
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,800
about it like offline where did it does

218
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,000
the same thing because we're recording

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,110
now and so basically just going ahead

220
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,529
and say ok like if our problem is remote

221
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:55,740
it also moves the the attack surface

222
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,350
like somewhere else so this there are so

223
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,959
many solutions for the enterprise world

224
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,269
so many and surprisingly enough and like

225
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,410
nothing is amazing which is ok but our

226
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,810
solutions server security company sells

227
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,480
and life is good but surprisingly enough

228
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,899
in the mobile landscape then there are

229
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,329
no good solutions for almost anything

230
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,540
now I hope I have enough time to talk

231
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,699
about all kind of things that I know and

232
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,860
analyze them and say why there aren't

233
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,019
when I talk about at least a little bit

234
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,860
okay so in the mobile world let's like

235
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,569
let's take a look like ok what is

236
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,269
different in the mobile world except

237
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,939
that it's like relatively new like we've

238
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:44,550
been having mobile devices for the last

239
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,390
15 years or so

240
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,430
you know we've been having enterprise

241
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,040
software since forever and we've been

242
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,090
having internet for 30 years or so 30

243
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,770
much less 20-something years or so so we

244
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,970
do have time for that

245
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,970
but basically I wanted to talk about

246
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,010
three points and that have to do with

247
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,880
the mobile landscape so one of them is

248
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,050
essentially that in the enterprise world

249
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,870
we can just decide that everything is

250
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,470
going to be internal and that if we have

251
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,780
any mobile apps that are related to the

252
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,030
enterprise only allow them what you are

253
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,430
in the enterprise network maybe even

254
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,470
only when you are in particular an

255
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,140
access point and then the problem

256
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,990
reduces to classical enterprise things

257
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,720
in terms of having your clients on

258
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,660
mobile devices so it's less interesting

259
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,960
in this perspective the second one is

260
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,000
that the second observation is that in

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,620
the consumer world let's say you

262
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,180
download grub and no I don't work for

263
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,400
grub or download Angry Birds or you

264
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,490
download a hello world application for a

265
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,890
iOS or 400 whatever it may be then

266
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,560
basically there is a lot of things that

267
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,160
are accessible on a device that anybody

268
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,360
could have even if all the logic of the

269
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,700
important logic is done on the company

270
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,860
servers so why is this important because

271
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,190
you can actually use some confused

272
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,250
deputy like take advantage of a device

273
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,350
that communicates with the servers and

274
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,460
in this way or another other sabotage

275
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,170
behavior of others for example you know

276
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,720
kind of scenarios or just you know do

277
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,430
you think that you are not supposed to

278
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,070
be doing so this is a problem the

279
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,510
problem is like what you have on a

280
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,870
client and if a client gets you know

281
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,760
their server like a lousy to connect to

282
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,620
it whether it is legit or it's been

283
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,340
breached and it is always another type

284
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,350
of applications that is or threads that

285
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,010
are important is that for a lot of

286
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,530
applications then you just have a lot a

287
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,090
lot of things on application themselves

288
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,180
so it can be like particular IP

289
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,610
even if the developer that says like

290
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,399
alright like I'm going to now do machine

291
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,070
learning solution not on the cloud I'm

292
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,839
going to take advantage of like Google

293
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,810
or Apple's framework and I'm going to do

294
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,339
a lot of things on the device itself so

295
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:13,870
even if it's not connected and doing all

296
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,170
kind of stuff so one can go and like say

297
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,250
all right let's see what a developer

298
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,980
does and we are the other and the other

299
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,260
thing is that when I want to be

300
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,540
efficient you're always caches and

301
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,029
they're always all kind of ways and like

302
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:32,470
yesterday's servers are today's apps so

303
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,330
a lot of times you have application tips

304
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,660
so much data that is in the device

305
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,670
itself that it becomes another type of

306
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,550
threat and is it's important because

307
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,770
it's very likely that even though there

308
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,800
are all kind of like scanner is even by

309
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,529
like Google or iOS like Google today

310
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:56,140
protect if you know it's safety net or

311
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,550
some ApS like this if you are more

312
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,940
Android guys and girls then it is very

313
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,100
very very likely that they will never

314
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,890
find out that all kind of data like

315
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,279
being breached or taken mostly because

316
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,589
like Google Play services cared more

317
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,330
about like the device integrity and

318
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,709
whatever is like in the read-only

319
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,050
partition and so on

320
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,260
so the mobile world is different in

321
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,959
several ways especially that whatever

322
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,670
you have in the device itself is not

323
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,100
controlled what it means in towards or

324
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,290
in two sentences is that you can go

325
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,029
ahead completely replace the operating

326
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:35,709
system that is like everything that is

327
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,140
below what the application runs and

328
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,390
there are billions of ways to identify

329
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,940
but for every way to identify there is a

330
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,579
way to pass the identification in one

331
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:47,140
word I can go ahead and instead of

332
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,720
Android OS I can I can create

333
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,990
run OS where I modify every system call

334
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,680
to be to do something that is like

335
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,079
unnoticed by the application developer

336
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,490
unnoticed by anyone and I can do

337
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,649
essentially whatever I want okay now

338
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,170
basically

339
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,210
here comes something that is interesting

340
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,370
and important yes of course we care

341
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,170
about it for like banking up for

342
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,820
insurance up for everything it has like

343
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,510
a transaction and I'm very very very

344
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,720
well aware of like the players in the

345
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,630
industry and what happens when like

346
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,460
money is stolen

347
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,140
like you know cybersecurity and

348
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,080
insurance they go together always at

349
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,540
least almost always but I'm not going to

350
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,940
talk about these things okay so for the

351
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,650
sake of just being honest and for the

352
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,110
sake of completion I'm not going to talk

353
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,060
about the entire ecosystem let's assume

354
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,070
that like insurance and what happens if

355
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,600
something happens to someone is not

356
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,270
interesting for this talk what is

357
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,420
interesting is that like there are many

358
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,670
many many markets except for like

359
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,210
banking that actually drive what is

360
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,470
known as mobile phones and what drives

361
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,460
it is not the financial apps but just a

362
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,270
application that are like more childish

363
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,400
or more damp or like less interesting

364
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,720
mostly games okay life is the playground

365
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,240
but mostly games drive this another kind

366
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,390
of other applications so surprisingly

367
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,350
there is a lot a lot a lot of fraud and

368
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,120
a lot of like illegal or non legit

369
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,860
transactions on things that are supposed

370
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,520
to not interest anyone that is life okay

371
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,200
so this is something that is very very

372
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,290
very important a lot of companies gaming

373
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,000
companies advertisement companies and

374
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,290
I'm going to talk a little bit about the

375
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,620
ecosystem of it very soon they started

376
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,570
caring about it only recently because

377
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,370
it's actually frauds are part of the

378
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,890
ecosystem and it's an intended part of

379
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,060
the ecosystem that I'm going to talk

380
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,660
about but basically there are a lot of

381
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,589
issues here so essentially like whether

382
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,510
you like it or not in your company they

383
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,420
develop an application or like

384
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,579
application and services and servers or

385
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,800
whatever then the user of control of

386
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,190
several things so first of all you can

387
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,869
go ahead and like

388
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,339
information of the application user and

389
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,980
then people would go and say hey what's

390
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,680
going on you violate my privacy what is

391
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,380
this why is this and so on so forth

392
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,930
which by the way there has been a lot of

393
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,570
changes in the android framework in the

394
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,200
last three or four years that would like

395
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,570
they would scan your applications if you

396
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,390
do if you send the information about

397
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,000
like the user in an obvious way so in

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,180
the past you could like ask for contacts

399
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,040
permission to access contacts and you

400
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,350
could go ahead and like put all the

401
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,630
contacts send them immediately and this

402
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,490
application would later go because of

403
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,070
change in terms of services and removed

404
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,270
from where there would be removed from

405
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,890
the Play Store because Google changed

406
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,080
like the terms of services so all kind

407
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,430
of monetization companies or

408
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,020
advertisement companies or analytics

409
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,300
companies would go like bananas they

410
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,870
grow like hey what the hell is going on

411
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,990
and then and then like they would need

412
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,370
to find in the other way is not

413
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,080
necessarily so basically clever but

414
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,720
other clever ways to do things in a less

415
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,680
obvious way okay so this is one thing

416
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,840
another thing is of course that like

417
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,190
each application can expose the back end

418
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,500
like the server-side to all kind of

419
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,310
risks because you have an entry point to

420
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,540
the corporate and usually now there's of

421
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,340
course more awareness of security but

422
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,820
usually the security mechanisms for such

423
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,250
game is let's put it this way would not

424
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,910
be so amazing okay and what is the

425
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,280
problem with this how people actually

426
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,170
make money that I'm going to like of

427
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,120
course discuss it a little bit more so

428
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,650
when there are a lot of money that is

429
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,320
involved then there is more motivation

430
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,540
to do all kind of fraud and I'm talking

431
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,740
we're talking about like the gaming

432
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,290
industry like the advertising industry

433
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,450
or monetization industry I'm talking

434
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,850
about more than ten billion dollars

435
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,070
there according to some researches that

436
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,520
I can provide sources for okay so the

437
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,080
problem is that there are a lot of

438
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,750
frauds things are vulnerable the

439
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,210
development model is literally based

440
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,480
on either open-source or third-party or

441
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,820
both and components and it is a problem

442
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,919
it brings much more risk that are either

443
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,510
apparent and clear or not

444
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,610
this is problem number one problem

445
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,950
number two already mentioned that even

446
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,230
if all the application and frameworks

447
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,110
are perfect you can go ahead jailbreak

448
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,140
your iOS device root your lymph device

449
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,390
and do whatever you want with the

450
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,640
operating system and it's so easy and

451
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,520
it's so like it's a ridiculously easy

452
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,220
sometimes that some people make made

453
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,929
very good business to fit like for the

454
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:13,049
last couple of years even for just you

455
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,600
know helping people to analyze such

456
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,409
things or to do such thing so in the

457
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,840
mobile ecosystem who who are the players

458
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,570
who's playing what's going on so we have

459
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,710
of course there are two manufacturers

460
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,470
right then we have all kind of software

461
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,390
vendors that also help the hardware

462
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,880
manufacturers and when you have like

463
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,470
when you hear about company that I would

464
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,500
like not mention that they sell devices

465
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,240
that have back door is inherent in the

466
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,539
devices this is part of this okay device

467
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,870
manufacturers like they integrate these

468
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,049
two things carriers retailers likes

469
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,590
Intel and StarHub and people sell

470
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,659
devices and they always put their own

471
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,690
things even if a lot of devices are just

472
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,480
bought directly then the phone companies

473
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,559
still play a part

474
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,230
ok and then there is the application

475
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,100
developers and presumably all of these

476
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,730
fellows their goal in life is to provide

477
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,679
for users because if there weren't users

478
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,480
Google and Apple would not be making

479
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,450
money and then there would be nothing so

480
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,950
this is what application developers are

481
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,370
also important and so on now in losers

482
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,140
are the users that are important that

483
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,440
are letit and are non legit users that

484
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,080
are humans what do I mean that you pay

485
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,320
people did anybody watch for example the

486
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,399
South Park who watch the South Park good

487
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,899
so you know you're laughing you know

488
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,549
what episode I'm talking about right

489
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:44,190
like where butters or professor chaos

490
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,210
hired people to do shaming

491
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,660
on Facebook did you see that so people

492
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,050
hire like all kind of like human s farms

493
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,180
let's put it this way to don't kind of

494
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,370
things like to click to answer is

495
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,790
opposed to to install applications to do

496
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,870
all kind of things like that

497
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,600
and this is how things work like just

498
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,780
like people works talk like in in

499
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,690
politics like to they pay people to do

500
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,640
to post things on Facebook on Twitter

501
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,460
they pay people to to reply to do all

502
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,010
kind of like a talk box like it's a paid

503
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,770
industry each and a lot of people

504
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,050
unfortunately do that okay so there are

505
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,450
non legit but there are human what is

506
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,310
the problem here that you need to figure

507
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,360
out that they are not legit I mean other

508
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,720
things that our users are like if you

509
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,460
make an application that you want to

510
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,980
test it so you would do all kind of

511
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,660
automation scripts maybe you will record

512
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,340
yourself and replay and stuff like that

513
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,490
and the last one which is a combination

514
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,210
of the last two one crossing out the

515
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,440
human word is all kind of non legit and

516
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,920
automated stuff or BOTS so when we talk

517
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,320
about the victims the victims can be the

518
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,670
device itself what's on the device

519
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,680
itself and it could be what the device

520
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,190
communicates with to reach the back end

521
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,560
so let's talk now about some types of

522
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,920
bots like what we have so one type of

523
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,370
bat is of device scripts and off defy

524
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,640
scripts have no device so the only thing

525
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,260
that can attack is the back end

526
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,470
themselves and if we add a way to

527
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,620
identify that there is no device then

528
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,780
we're done we just block all traffic

529
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,780
from non device we send a big guy or big

530
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,730
girl to beat we recorded out of whoever

531
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,090
with automatically identify didn't

532
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,730
problem is done right the other one our

533
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,820
own device scripts then there is a

534
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,740
problem okay

535
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,350
because we can target things on the

536
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,910
device itself like the applications

537
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,340
themselves maybe other application

538
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,140
depends if we have like sandbox escape

539
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,510
or if the device is compromised or

540
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,309
something like that maybe the device

541
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:03,130
itself is not in start a script but like

542
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,620
does the automated work and like sends

543
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,080
everyone everything that I do or have or

544
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,780
something to other companies maybe as

545
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,210
maybe no actually we actually get like

546
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,570
for developing such things we get help

547
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,330
from Google and from Apple why do we get

548
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,600
help because we're developers we get all

549
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,280
kind of things to test our application

550
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,220
to do optimation so we can use it to

551
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,630
actually do things that are not legit

552
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,850
the next category is the category that

553
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,490
is like it's malware okay

554
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,710
Merida is able to achieve sandbox escape

555
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,960
or malware integrated in the platform

556
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,850
itself that targets specific things and

557
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,300
the last one is basically also on the

558
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
device itself but results basically

559
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,630
usually from having like some sdk it is

560
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,160
integrated and does all kind of things

561
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,650
against us now of device scripts I

562
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,700
already mentioned like pretty much all

563
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,400
of this but there the nice thing about

564
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,890
them is that they can aid us to do

565
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,920
penetration testing to the servers and

566
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,679
it is really protected against okay now

567
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:22,780
there are well-known protections are

568
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,990
written here that is mostly

569
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,450
authentication of some ways but the

570
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,130
authentication needs to be good enough

571
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,780
to prevent all kind of replay attacks

572
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,270
it's not a real problem this problem is

573
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,350
solved okay on device script as I said

574
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,360
the main problem is that you cannot

575
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,770
trust the operating system it is a

576
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,760
problem another problem is that even if

577
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,809
you have things that are super legit

578
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:51,790
application can be repackaged and then

579
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,390
this could be very problematic now I'm

580
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,250
not going to talk too much about all the

581
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,200
attack vectors also depending somebody

582
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,030
yes

583
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,320
to the device if somebody doesn't have

584
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,510
access to the device if you try it if

585
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,960
you don't trust be happy to give you

586
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,090
such a list of like exceptions and cases

587
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,840
like after the talk happily but this is

588
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,280
the target of like if we talk about

589
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,730
solutions of what kind of solution to do

590
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,350
behavior analysis like they want to see

591
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,720
hey it's on the device but is it really

592
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,610
is or not crosstab vulnerability sandbox

593
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,970
escapes and it can do all kinds of

594
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,100
things that are not very very very nice

595
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,050
it can be the target of like antivirus

596
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,020
or anti-malware tool but here is the

597
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,590
problem both in iOS and in Android

598
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,030
these tools are essentially not

599
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,700
effective because unless you sit in the

600
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,620
platform itself and you have access

601
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,040
privileges you cannot you cannot obtain

602
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,960
a lot of things like you cannot really

603
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,550
get that you're not who you cannot

604
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,700
interpose and they cannot do things like

605
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,770
anti viruses do like on the PC world

606
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,530
okay you need cooperation from the

607
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,450
platform level you just have to do it

608
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,200
how does an antivirus work like in

609
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,390
Windows you inject some kernel modules

610
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,010
and does what kind of things you have to

611
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,600
that's how it works

612
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:18,120
okay okay now for on device in up

613
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,790
vulnerabilities of course there can be

614
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,450
all kind of bugs for the developer okay

615
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,790
but mostly there are all kind of

616
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,690
malicious SDKs and there is a

617
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,310
combination of all kind of these

618
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,160
problems okay so there are some

619
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,380
solutions for each one of the problems

620
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,000
that I mentioned but nothing is perfect

621
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,730
now in the past as I mean like in the

622
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,030
mobile in the non mobile case okay then

623
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,370
how do people develop things they would

624
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,370
have their own software they would have

625
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,680
it's like big companies they would have

626
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,820
companies working on this library

627
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,950
companies working sorry teams working on

628
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,050
this library teams working on that

629
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,700
library they would integration between

630
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,050
the teams they would purchase libraries

631
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,320
from other providers maybe and so on

632
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,280
then if someone got into the way for

633
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,230
example yesterday if somebody attended

634
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,970
Alex talked here like he mentioned about

635
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,460
compromised Visual Studio linker that

636
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,280
would just inject like the same malware

637
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,620
to everything it compiled with so this

638
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,120
is like a kind of tool and if somebody

639
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,730
like got in the way then game over it's

640
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,870
done okay

641
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,930
but otherwise like everything was built

642
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,940
on trust

643
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,040
what about making money on this kind of

644
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,780
development well then it's pretty

645
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,910
obvious either paid licenses in-app

646
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,510
purchases ads if like nobody charges

647
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,220
something for none and when we talk

648
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,380
about ads then there are all kind of

649
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,930
affiliate networks aching aid in a

650
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,990
curious tool bar industry the notorious

651
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,170
installer industry which all of them

652
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,360
will sooner or later be related to

653
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,020
notorious malware industry okay I don't

654
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,920
commit for everyone but there are enough

655
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,160
cases that are related so that we can be

656
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,680
convinced about it now what happens in

657
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,050
the present day that is in the mobile so

658
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,180
basically most of the application we

659
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,570
download our free right why would we pay

660
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,400
why would we want to do that so

661
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
basically there are free applications

662
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,120
that need to be monetized somehow and

663
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,380
for monetizing it application developers

664
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,710
are usually going to be using third

665
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,050
party and the third parties will be

666
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,620
having all kind of analytic tools

667
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,540
trackers installed trackers and so on so

668
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,910
forth and no developer is really going

669
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,280
to check out is something fishy about it

670
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,970
never okay so there are two categories

671
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,920
two main categories of fit that are

672
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,440
either free and not open source tools

673
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,330
SDK that we integrate

674
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,790
maybe it's an SDK and maybe it's like

675
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,640
just you know a called this script and

676
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,290
we'll do it on the server is this API

677
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,940
calls we'll do it on the servers it's

678
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,750
also perfectly OD and basically another

679
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,250
thing that we'll have

680
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,300
is that like sorry what did I miss here

681
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,450
okay and basically basically what we're

682
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,190
going to have is like a lot a lot of

683
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,560
disaster case both for like checking

684
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,750
ourselves and like for profiling herself

685
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,250
and seeing what's going on with the user

686
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,130
but also for monetizing which is popping

687
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,080
up hey would you like to install these

688
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,090
apps so that when clicking this

689
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,820
application or in looking at this what's

690
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,280
known as a compression then or for

691
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,800
watching some video then the develop

692
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,740
location developer will get some money

693
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,730
so in the mobile ecosystem as you lead

694
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,740
her many things that have to do not

695
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,240
necessarily with the application

696
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,910
themselves but also with other things so

697
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,440
when we talk about providers of apps

698
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,120
they don't necessarily care about

699
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,250
security what happening there and we

700
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,520
talked about device security they also

701
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,290
don't care too much about what happens

702
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,030
other devices themselves we want to sell

703
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,190
hardware that's the way it is if you

704
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,640
talk to any IOT company embedded company

705
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,500
that manufactures product I can

706
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,160
guarantee you that in most cases they

707
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,990
will say hey okay I just want to sell my

708
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,940
chip I don't care about security because

709
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,190
that's what they do if it's like more

710
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,350
like bigger company and not just a

711
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,660
manufacturer then maybe they will care

712
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,790
but like the first one to say ok let

713
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,620
integrator take care of three problems I

714
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,690
don't care about it so basically the

715
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,840
main problem main main main problem with

716
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,620
mobile is that you can replace the

717
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,090
operating system and do whatever you

718
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,610
want and then your power is like

719
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,070
unlimited you can do whatever whatever

720
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,230
whatever you want so just a quick recap

721
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,200
like who are the consumers of possible

722
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,540
solutions enterprises in all kind of

723
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,080
ways the original equipment

724
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,780
manufacturers so for that they might

725
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,820
want to have like any anti analytics

726
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,190
anti hooking techniques of stuff like

727
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,820
that selling to OEMs it's very very very

728
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,980
tough by the way

729
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,260
it's a bad business model in many many

730
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,510
many cases other thing is application

731
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,980
developers that would not care about

732
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,930
security at all unless it affects their

733
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:37,210
money okay and essentially if we look at

734
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,360
how money can be affected then it's

735
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,060
pretty much the same as with the PC or

736
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,410
desktop case but affiliate networks pay

737
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,500
em much much more important role because

738
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,440
there is like much less paid for

739
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,950
software okay another thing in-app

740
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,690
purchases with the exception of like

741
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,970
games when you would like buy expansion

742
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,210
packs and in the PC then in-app

743
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,650
purchases are super super super

744
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,830
important and then come something that

745
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,840
does have to do with like stealing

746
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,140
credit cards and stuff like that I'm not

747
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,760
going to get into too much details I

748
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,820
wanted to show like a showcase of a

749
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,520
really big company that is let's say our

750
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,710
consulting clients like we have product

751
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,620
deploys then that's one of the things

752
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,080
that like really really really bother

753
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,920
them is that people use credit stolen

754
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,620
credit cards when they register like for

755
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,250
an app they do a legit payment one time

756
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,720
or two times I couldn't convince

757
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,390
existing solutions that like okay it's a

758
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:47,620
lady tutor we paid and later on they're

759
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,810
abusing their system to do all kinds of

760
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,170
other things so uniquely it's called

761
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,180
like the seven-day problem or the

762
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,970
one-week problem whoa

763
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,340
practically is critically low I can

764
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,780
swear I connected it alone

765
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,820
are we good yeah okay sorry

766
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,060
take it off at editing Singapore like

767
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,980
you have the you always have to turn on

768
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,449
like being caught in the electrical

769
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,480
socket why some people are not from here

770
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,270
there are of these things okay but I

771
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,520
said that they 4% and I said the day huh

772
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,840
alright so basically there is the

773
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,460
seven-day problem were like the one-week

774
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,379
problem that's like people register

775
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:35,750
and at the beginning Darla cheat and

776
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,259
after seven days for like hell freezes

777
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:40,849
over and there are prophecies everywhere

778
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:41,809
and everybody can do whatever they want

779
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:46,159
so these things are very very very

780
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,869
problematic and when you talk about like

781
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:50,899
the echo system in mobile basically

782
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:53,509
we're going to have like the users at

783
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,909
the right hand side there's going to be

784
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,730
somebody like publisher that the

785
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,700
application developer somehow works in

786
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,440
some SDK to make money from me the

787
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,940
publisher will have another publisher

788
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,619
and the publisher now if another

789
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:08,900
publisher and a campaign provider that

790
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,950
aggregates things for like the service

791
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,839
requester which will be like a company

792
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,049
that wants to sell their apps and will

793
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,559
have a budget and budget can be huge

794
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:24,980
like per game it can be let's say two

795
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,279
digits like with millions easily like

796
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:31,099
over ten millions easily for like a new

797
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,500
campaign of game there's a lot of money

798
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,470
in the industry a lot and every one in

799
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,390
this chain could have like incentive to

800
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,279
to steal money like to have fraud all

801
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:48,589
transaction so basically there's a lot

802
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:50,450
of things like that okay so there are

803
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,700
reasons to do things and we don't have

804
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,319
too much time left so I'm going to talk

805
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,990
about some of the attacking patterns and

806
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,460
some of the trending patterns and after

807
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,319
the talk I'd be happy to talk about it

808
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,970
more because I don't like to wave hands

809
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,410
I don't like to talk about real things

810
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,180
okay so essentially some of the

811
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,819
potential problems for like preventing

812
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:14,000
like all kind of automated alleged

813
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,589
behavior would be all kind of like SDK

814
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:20,839
testers or like open source testers I'm

815
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:22,490
not going to name companies but I could

816
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:26,660
and preventing repackaging and verifying

817
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,000
anti tempering the repackaging which for

818
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,089
like application stores for some

819
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,890
countries are not relevant because

820
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,529
they're based on repackaging okay and

821
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:38,210
you're huge countries with a lot of

822
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,610
users

823
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,190
insurance of course testing penetration

824
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,410
testing as a service and analytics and

825
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:48,740
stuff like that and to be honest there

826
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,210
is a problem with deployment of

827
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,280
solutions because everybody wants to not

828
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,210
be intrusive

829
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,280
they're afraid attack solution would

830
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,560
cause the crashes or like bad

831
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,450
performance and then users will

832
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,710
uninstall the app and then they don't

833
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,610
make money so speaking about like some

834
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,160
attacking pattern I can tell you that

835
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,630
when I started working on these things

836
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:13,160
like in 2014 I had an idea to deal

837
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,870
virtualization I company the data

838
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,880
virtualization of Android and I was

839
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,320
testing a lot of things so I developed a

840
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,230
lot of automatic tools in particular I

841
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,350
had like emulators or Android device

842
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,710
farms that were able to I were able to

843
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,020
run a lot of Android devices virtualized

844
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,930
and I would argue to do all kinds of

845
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,180
things and I told myself like hey I

846
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,190
could productize that and I could

847
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,020
techniques that I used like to do

848
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,760
penetration testing for mobile ecosystem

849
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,950
I could go ahead like make a business of

850
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,010
it but all my colleagues that said that

851
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,530
ah it's not a good idea nobody will buy

852
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,810
it and all like the investment firms for

853
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,060
that it's not a good idea so now we're

854
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,410
recorded so I'm not going to say what I

855
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:59,500
want to say but I will say it anyway

856
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,880
I'll say it later ok so basically this

857
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,560
was like making a product out of it

858
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,030
although today there's several such

859
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,560
automated penetration testing bla bla

860
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,110
bla bla company was considered to not be

861
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,840
a good idea and it's not surprising

862
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,780
because like a lot of investment firms

863
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,680
are made a lot of idiots work were a lot

864
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,410
of money exists ok it's a well-known

865
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,480
fact everybody knows that half of the

866
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,620
people are smiling it is there it is ok

867
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,860
so basically this leads to some

868
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,260
ecosystem and infrastructure that

869
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,960
somehow along the way I ended up like

870
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,810
doing some things for companies and used

871
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:46,010
this infrastructure ok now one of the

872
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,930
nice things that you could do it like if

873
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,060
you are able to like scale things would

874
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,740
be to actually go ahead

875
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,830
and do like this automated farms and you

876
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,360
know the client is legit the current is

877
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,619
mobile and everything is okay and you

878
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,010
can like check the packet so essentially

879
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,910
the idea was going to do massive scale

880
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,520
do fasting do penetration testing and do

881
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,930
all other things that are very very very

882
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,380
common for both the scale testing and

883
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,840
the penetration testing industries in

884
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,170
the Old Market okay now in the mobile

885
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,550
system and we identified a couple of

886
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,110
years ago problem that again didn't

887
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,920
interest anyone so let's say that we

888
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,100
made a little bit of money in the g28 if

889
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,750
anybody wants to hear interesting story

890
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,750
talk to me after ok but there are all

891
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,980
kind of things that are used to track

892
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,920
users and trackers are you to do each

893
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,450
business there are at least two huge

894
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,490
trackers that almost any mobile

895
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,590
application would have one of them to

896
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,450
verify that applications been installed

897
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,340
or stuff like that and they always have

898
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,550
a kind of like parameters data like

899
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,410
always used in Android for example it

900
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,630
would be like advertising ID goggle

901
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,750
advertising ID and like location your

902
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,450
location IP stuff like that if it's a

903
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,460
browser user agent all kind of things

904
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,119
that you can like fake either on your

905
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:10,369
application level like user agent

906
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:11,810
everybody configure user agent on an

907
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,780
HTTP request or you can go ahead on on

908
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,060
and on your platform itself fake

909
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,550
whatever the application like things and

910
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,720
if you're able to manufacture and if

911
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,950
you're in a polymer factor talk to

912
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,420
manufacture such devices then you're

913
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,530
good so essentially the problem becomes

914
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,600
what if one is able to go ahead and

915
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,690
attack those mobile networks in a way

916
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,600
that is like interesting so the answer

917
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,380
the virtualized answer means this all

918
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,560
right we can do it let's do it instead

919
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,780
of having just one user trying to do all

920
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,900
kind of things we're going to use

921
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,490
virtualization techniques in order to

922
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,780
superscalar self okay so this is really

923
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,670
really really nice for penetration

924
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,130
testing and it happened to be very very

925
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,360
very nice for like real-life attack

926
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,000
especially because let's say that a lot

927
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,140
of the monetization industry and I don't

928
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,250
want to offend anyone because I'm

929
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,300
recorded is unbelievably stupid and like

930
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,530
attacking them like is unbelievably easy

931
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,060
simply because nobody cared for years

932
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,330
okay so really nobody cares until 2017

933
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,280
nobody cared completely you could do

934
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,220
whatever you want like if you'd go and

935
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,440
like start a session from the same IP

936
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,780
all the time you would be identified by

937
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,880
wow what a smart offense there is always

938
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,790
something smarter to do okay so the idea

939
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:47,440
for scaling is one right so power is

940
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,120
routing okay or jailbreaking we're out

941
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,210
of time so if you do that application

942
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,370
will not know will not care end of story

943
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,190
no matter how much somebody checks for

944
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,260
protection they will never outsmart us

945
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,110
you're done so one will devices you can

946
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,210
do it and it means like you root the

947
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,010
device but how many devices you can do

948
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,950
so you have scale problems okay so on

949
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,260
fake devices you can do whatever you

950
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,330
want but it's not so easy like you need

951
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,250
guys like me that have a lot of

952
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,110
experience in OS internals and ported

953
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,110
things like that and in particular did a

954
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,680
lot of Android work or beginning two

955
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,320
years ago or one year ago take advantage

956
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,630
of Apple open sourcing snow which is the

957
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,080
cookie X no kernel to bring something

958
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,960
like if anybody ever knew open Darwin or

959
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,670
like ran Mac OS on a virtual machine

960
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,220
then there are all kind of projects like

961
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,840
this that you can run Mac like on your

962
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,590
PC so now you can run also iOS on your

963
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,390
PC on some extents so there are actually

964
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,090
very very nice tricks about it it has to

965
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:52,300
do if you have an x86 machine with the

966
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,490
iOS simulator that you can like extract

967
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,410
the binaries from there if you want to

968
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,050
like simulate the x86 stuff the problem

969
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,140
would x86 is that iOS binaries would not

970
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,180
work at this and now that Apple

971
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,300
open-source know you can also purchase

972
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,460
this and it is pretty pretty pretty nice

973
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,410
this is why I said it it's like hard to

974
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,450
achieve so this is one thing the

975
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,060
unlimited power okay of the device the

976
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:16,910
other thing would

977
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,840
okay how do you manage that so like a

978
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,340
suggestion for like scaling once you

979
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,680
manage like to create one device is to

980
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,390
go ahead and spread it like over all

981
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,250
kinds of geographies over all kind of

982
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,750
cloud providers over all kind of

983
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,120
anything and yes also combine real

984
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,470
devices with that okay and I'm going to

985
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,600
have like to recap very very very soon

986
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:44,529
so let's talk about some solutions to

987
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,570
potential solution to the problems which

988
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,130
is something that I really don't like

989
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,650
saying so I put two images that I put

990
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,420
from before okay

991
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,970
the idea is basic idea deny the thing

992
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,400
that I'd like saying is that one can use

993
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,610
the exact mechanisms of attacking to

994
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,720
actually create a classifier that

995
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,490
defends against some of the attacking

996
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,950
now those who understand things we say

997
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,170
yeah but you would do overfitting like

998
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,850
you defense only again you'll defend

999
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,070
only against your attacks but it's not

1000
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,200
necessarily true okay because there are

1001
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,380
all kinds of things that you can do and

1002
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,050
taking it to advantage that data that is

1003
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,190
like real and like from your users so

1004
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,830
yeah like supposed solution is like

1005
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,050
building classifiers so it's these

1006
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,740
things again and now you also have like

1007
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,140
fire because not just really pissed off

1008
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,560
to this new gun and the idea is like

1009
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,690
this the idea is to do something that

1010
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:48,320
like actually learns things from real

1011
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,900
device experience combines like data set

1012
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,430
I'm not going to say exactly how we do

1013
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,700
it that happens also both for like

1014
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,440
automatic tool and from real-life

1015
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,080
experiences with the permission of the

1016
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,340
developers so we get data posting bots

1017
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,020
that like we build both fangs like a

1018
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:14,810
device let's say sdk feature that is

1019
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:17,240
done when the application are actually

1020
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,710
the application developers are testing

1021
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,960
themselves and the last thing that like

1022
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,300
we do is that we actually also go ahead

1023
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,850
and with the consent of the application

1024
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,810
developers and

1025
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,520
better analytics like on the field like

1026
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,340
from real users so we take this into

1027
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,250
advantage will build classifiers and our

1028
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,940
solutions and like I don't lie I said it

1029
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,280
we offer some things as a service there

1030
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,140
is no I was talking to a friend earlier

1031
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,700
today and I was saying that there's

1032
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,070
absolutely no company in the universe

1033
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,170
that can say hey we have one day of

1034
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,660
deployment wants to have huge data to

1035
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,390
process so we don't even have fir this

1036
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,130
is a product only to customers who

1037
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,860
already work with and because we need

1038
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,230
months to get things going because this

1039
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:05,430
is life okay so essentially we go ahead

1040
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,650
and we achieve several things together

1041
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,040
just like we leveraged our we leveraged

1042
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,990
our skill set let's put it this way of

1043
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,180
like wanting to do this penetration

1044
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,590
testing nobody cared

1045
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,540
we found some way to do other things now

1046
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,090
people do care but we do this and other

1047
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,760
things as well and like this is what we

1048
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,120
do like we check how kind of things if

1049
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,160
something is off the device I'm just

1050
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,840
going to I'm going to give you our

1051
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,060
solution for free it's not even a

1052
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,550
problem like for identifying what is

1053
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:37,290
legit and what is it on device and what

1054
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,750
is not device I mean you have three

1055
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,790
accesses right and like the Earth

1056
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,870
rotates and red like physics like you

1057
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,500
can go ahead and figure out that physics

1058
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,080
law exists and now I could go and say uh

1059
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,840
but I can go ahead and like fake the

1060
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,340
measurement sensor or stuff like that

1061
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,960
the world is continuous the word is not

1062
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,430
discrete there are ways to identify it

1063
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,880
hundred percent no false I mean shoot me

1064
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,710
now if I'm lying okay you need to be

1065
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,440
unbelievably smart and dedicated and

1066
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,320
nobody is that dedicated maybe that's

1067
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,320
smart but that dedicated no okay and for

1068
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,000
things that are off devices we learn and

1069
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,480
we do all kind of things I mean it's

1070
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,580
really really really achievable so it's

1071
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,500
pretty nice so given like the power and

1072
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,530
limited power and construct that we did

1073
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,350
earlier we are actually able to go ahead

1074
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,170
and

1075
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,140
you know do this on the one case and

1076
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,670
scale like with the virtual machines and

1077
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,770
stuff like that and this is the time for

1078
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:42,040
something you notes all right so I'd be

1079
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,660
super happy to take some questions if

1080
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,190
somebody have although we are after time

1081
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,240
anybody I'd like to ask something in

1082
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,910
private is perfect as well okay so thank

1083
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,250
you so much for attending and I'd be

1084
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,710
super happy if I'm going to see some of

1085
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,619
you again next week in the armed

1086
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:04,299
exploitation training that we're doing

1087
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,190
as part of intersecting the city this

1088
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,170
would be fantastic if you need anything

1089
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,089
this is my email I'm going to be in

1090
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:14,910
Singapore until the 3rd 8th of June and

1091
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,829
or until the 1st of July it's pretty

1092
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:20,440
much the same and I'd be happy to have

1093
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,210
you there like there is a chance it's

1094
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,619
like the next courses that are planned

1095
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:27,599
in Singapore and there is a chance that

1096
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,650
that I was 10 till the 4th of July

1097
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,869
because some people asked to some kernel

1098
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:34,540
development course and if we secure

1099
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,369
tours for more people then I can

1100
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:38,829
guarantee that it will happen so be

1101
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:42,400
happy to stay more and please let me

1102
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,049
know like if you like what you heard and

1103
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:45,849
if you interested in something would be

1104
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:49,030
very very very happy too if you have

1105
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,430
interesting doing such things such as

1106
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,430
erosion yourself to give you tips from

1107
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,710
the only one reason that we're probably

1108
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,270
never going to be like a product company

1109
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,940
like we do consulting for some gaming

1110
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,530
companies those kind of stuff like this

1111
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,970
they say oh we're going to do our own

1112
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,760
solution and we have them like why not

1113
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,549
we don't care all right so thank you

1114
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:11,880
friends
