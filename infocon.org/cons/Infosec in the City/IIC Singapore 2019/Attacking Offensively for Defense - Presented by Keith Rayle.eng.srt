1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
I usually don't use the microphone so I

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,980
apologize for that right now today we're

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,930
going to talk about being a little bit

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,719
on the offense as part of our defense

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,630
my name is Keith rail my background is

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,440
military twenty-one years I played with

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,420
nuclear weapons I was a helicopter test

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,000
pilot threat officer various roles in

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,730
1997 I joined IBM became a security

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,460
consultant I've been around World Bank

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,690
Chicago Mercantile Exchange NASA JPL the

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,640
name of the commercial National

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,399
Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia I've

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,460
been in health care manufacturing power

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,620
just about every industry that you can

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,030
imagine so I've got a little bit of a

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,860
depth of background but I don't know a

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,610
lot about any of it so when we look and

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,219
think about and this is not a sales

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,920
pitch and it's not about artificial

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,170
intelligence but I've got to start there

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,350
so we can talk about how we can build an

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,110
offensive system against cyber criminals

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,290
one that's pertinent for today so when

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,909
we talk about artificial intelligence

26
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,080
it's really pretty simple at the small

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,810
level the atomic structure what we have

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,170
our layers input and output that we can

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,000
see what happens and then in here we

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,350
have hidden layers and the layers

31
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,860
consists of little nodes and a node is

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,310
pretty much a little dumb application

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,009
that goes out and grabs a piece of

34
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,590
information and goes back to the to what

35
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,970
it was fed and looks for that

36
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,570
information and says how much it found

37
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,450
the complexity comes in with AI systems

38
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,880
in the fact that you have billions of

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,770
these nodes connected to each other and

40
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,770
the operation is performed in a massive

41
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,960
parallel system so the reason they're

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,880
called neural networks is because of

43
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,409
like the brain we have all these

44
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,689
connections that go through every node

45
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,530
is connected to every node going forward

46
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,899
some AI systems do a single pass of

47
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,660
information I'll put the file in it'll

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,750
chew it and

49
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,170
done facial-recognition uses recursive

50
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,930
pathing that means that information is

51
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,900
fed back through the same layer until it

52
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,000
resolves what it was set out to find

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,540
with those little individual nodes let's

54
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,530
say for a photograph a facial photograph

55
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,910
the photograph may come in the first

56
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,400
time as the standard photo then it may

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,959
go to black and white then it may go to

58
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,760
a different color it may go large it may

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,620
go small and it keeps getting passed

60
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,540
through until we those specific points

61
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,610
are found now the thing that those

62
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,110
little nodes are going out and trying to

63
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,140
find are called features and features

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,720
are the core piece of any artificial

65
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,140
intelligence system this is the gold

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,209
features are the things that point

67
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,150
observable characteristics that the

68
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,520
system picks up and tries to find the

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,800
individual nodes pick up a feature and

70
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,420
go look for it now the quality of these

71
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,360
features is what's so critical to an AI

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
system and this is where we're learning

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,690
and behavior gets imparted to the

74
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,120
artificial intelligence system because

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
these these features are stacked and

76
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,100
weighted according to their importance

77
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,810
and their relevance within that

78
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,160
artificial intelligence system this is

79
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,250
basically how it works so these can

80
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,470
change over time as far as their value

81
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,220
and get moved up and down in the stack

82
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,329
now when we talk about the node and the

83
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,670
feature what happens down there at that

84
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,489
very very small level let's say that we

85
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,750
have a feature that's a bottle of

86
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,269
coca-cola and it has a $2.00 value that

87
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,570
value can change over time and we have a

88
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,180
node the little piece in there that goes

89
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,250
out and grabs that and looks for it in a

90
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,840
file and it sees 50% of that congruent

91
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,230
ones and zeros within that file it

92
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,820
outputs a value of $1 so at a very small

93
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,858
level artificial intelligence is very

94
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,360
simple

95
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,879
the complexity arises when we connect

96
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,340
all of these nodes together billions and

97
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,919
billions of connections and things now

98
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,680
this value changes according to how

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,120
often this is seen and how important it

100
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,819
is to what's being looked for and I'll

101
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,849
give you an example if we were going to

102
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:47,409
think about static analysis one of the

103
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,139
best systems is probably an antivirus

104
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,300
and we're going to get into the offense

105
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,310
of good defense in a second but a static

106
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,650
analysis system that would be very very

107
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,759
powerful used with artificial

108
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,659
intelligence isn't antivirus this this

109
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:06,879
way of looking for malware within

110
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,460
systems so there was an evolution of how

111
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,949
we've dealt with malware in the past the

112
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,830
first thing we did was we took malware

113
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,430
when it came to us or to our semantics

114
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,620
whoever was providing our signature base

115
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,379
they would get a malware sample and they

116
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,389
would create a hash of it they would put

117
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:28,990
the hash in a pile another email comes

118
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,330
in with something in it you run a hash

119
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,389
if it matched anything you knew that you

120
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,520
had malware the problem was is that if

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,819
one it in that file if a one was changed

122
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,069
to a zero the hash was completely

123
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:43,960
different it's non-relational not even

124
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,259
close so that was a real issue there it

125
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,889
wasn't very good for seeking out

126
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,740
variances within malware groupings or

127
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,919
families if you will so then we went to

128
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,440
something called the content pattern

129
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,500
recognition approach and what we do here

130
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,460
is we statically unpack unwrap unzip

131
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,949
files until we get down to the point of

132
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,110
detonation without detonating the

133
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,440
malware and it ends up that we can find

134
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,259
indicators of malware without detonating

135
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:20,319
we can see macros we can see certain

136
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,440
things even the URL sourcing comes into

137
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,020
play so all of these little bits of

138
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,110
information can be used to determine if

139
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,449
something's malware without even

140
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,209
detonating it will get into detonation

141
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,220
in a second and how this ties in

142
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,550
to the offense of defense so this is

143
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,640
kind of what we do now we tear things

144
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,280
down prior to detonation and we look for

145
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,140
those code blocks those little chunks

146
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,410
and those are the features and those

147
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,830
features can change over time based off

148
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,110
of how often we see them and how many

149
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,180
times it indicates if something's

150
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,970
malware or clean now we take those code

151
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,470
blocks when we build what you might call

152
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,870
super signatures and these super

153
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,440
signatures now have these code blocks to

154
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,500
where if the cybercriminal reuses that

155
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,460
code we catch it so we have behavior and

156
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,700
code blocks now in a static analysis

157
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,200
that we can use I'm not saying they're

158
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,230
lazy cyber criminals have a hard time

159
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,340
generating true zero day attacks what we

160
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,010
see are zero day vulnerabilities but

161
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,810
zero day attacks with the entire

162
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,780
delivery package are somewhat rare

163
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,370
because if they don't use the same code

164
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,640
they're using the same behaviors and

165
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,260
behaviors get into the next aspect of

166
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,550
this which is the sandbox analysis so

167
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,360
this is kind of where we are now the

168
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,700
model that we built at our company and

169
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,290
again this is not a sales pitch it's

170
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,680
just explaining how we built this we

171
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,450
started off with a two hidden layer

172
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,640
system we had one layer that looked for

173
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,050
clean one layer that looked for

174
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,550
malicious it was inefficient the clean

175
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,410
layer had 2.3 billion nodes and what

176
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,720
that that means is it just went out and

177
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,030
it looked for those indicators only and

178
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,729
it was connected to the next layer which

179
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,820
had 3.2 billion nodes so every time we

180
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,710
added a node in one we had to create 3.2

181
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,930
billion connections imagine adding

182
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,090
50,000 new nodes

183
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,429
it was very inefficient so we took that

184
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,820
that stack of features and we marked

185
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,830
them as malicious or clean indicators

186
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,450
and built a single layer so now what

187
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,920
happens is one operation a node goes out

188
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,140
and it'll grab a feature

189
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,420
this is clean and it goes in that file

190
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,180
it looks for those ones and zeros and if

191
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,580
it finds it it passes forward a value

192
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,410
malicious clean picks up picks these up

193
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,160
currently this is around 15 billion

194
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,120
nodes in our system we have 15 billion

195
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,190
code blocks that we use to analyze now

196
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,890
this is the static side of being able to

197
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,170
go offensive on cyber criminals so it's

198
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,750
extremely scalable fast etc and by the

199
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,570
way it took us five and a half years

200
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,760
just to build out the feature set for

201
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,770
this to train this artificial

202
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,390
intelligence system so what happened as

203
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,750
a result of us doing this we also add an

204
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,450
AI that automatically generates those

205
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,050
super signatures for us and we tested it

206
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,420
to see how efficient it was and this is

207
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,980
a 74 day run recent run to see how much

208
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,360
we picked up off that our competitors

209
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,650
did not on st 3 so the highest occurred

210
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,200
around 2 days prior to the rest of them

211
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
getting it but all the way out to 74

212
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,240
days we were picking up zero day attacks

213
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,400
that our competitors hadn't and it's

214
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,900
because those code blocks they get

215
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,840
reused by cyber criminals that's where

216
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,100
we want to hit him at and be able to

217
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,470
recognize it immediately so that's one

218
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,010
part of our offense and by the way this

219
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,560
is relatively new this was only given to

220
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,510
me a couple of days ago the analysis

221
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,550
most of it that we caught by the way

222
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,030
were Trojans banking Trojans there were

223
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,580
some different things like add loaders

224
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,140
different types of malware families etc

225
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,960
this big blue ball bought a box here

226
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,610
we're still investigating trying to

227
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,370
figure out what that consisted of so

228
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,930
like I said this is relatively new

229
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,630
information so now here's part one of

230
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,390
this offense against cyber criminals

231
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,320
that static attempt to determine what

232
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,040
they're doing within your systems so the

233
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,140
next thing we can look at that we daisy

234
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,620
chain within our operator

235
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,040
view of being on the offense is a

236
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,710
dynamic analysis of cyber criminal

237
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,580
activity and what we do here is we use

238
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,830
the standard attack my methodologies to

239
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,280
analyze what they're trying to get to

240
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,020
there are different foundational

241
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,630
approaches to describing the chain of

242
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,360
events that lead to malware being

243
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,130
inserted within systems it's the kill

244
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,800
chain if you will one of the more

245
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,980
popular kill chains is mitre

246
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,710
it's very descriptive how many people

247
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,080
here under know about mitre there's a

248
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,480
few ok anyways it's very very

249
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,730
descriptive very detailed and a very

250
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,640
powerful framework to analyze malware

251
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,410
against to see what it's really trying

252
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,220
to do we have these within the the

253
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,000
attack size of it side of it we have

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,330
different steps that malware takes to be

255
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,980
able to be successfully implemented

256
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,470
within your your environment the initial

257
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,290
X access execution persistence of it etc

258
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,240
these are all the steps that malware

259
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,840
takes now if we were to look at the

260
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,990
mitre framework in relation to those

261
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,520
steps we have very very prescriptive

262
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,660
very detailed information about how that

263
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,310
attack is unfolding or what's being used

264
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,400
within this attack framework to allow

265
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,740
this malware to exploit your systems for

266
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,300
instance under credential access we have

267
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,160
account manipulation fashion history

268
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,340
brute force within each one of these

269
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,710
there will be hundreds of thousands

270
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,140
potentially different hashes that are

271
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,090
associated with the specific activities

272
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,670
that are taken by that malware to

273
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,070
accomplish a brute-force attack against

274
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,380
your systems and these are all little

275
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,200
code blocks again that do this right

276
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,420
little jumps within that program within

277
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,180
that malware program so what does this

278
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,090
really mean it means that if we get a

279
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,010
piece of malware and the most recent one

280
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,770
that we applied this to in our labs up

281
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,800
in Vancouver British Columbia in Canada

282
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,500
was the orange worm attack and we went

283
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,830
ahead and toured apart manual

284
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,450
and we ran it against the miter

285
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,020
framework and we had these different

286
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,900
chunks of code that we found that fit

287
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,410
underneath the miter attack framework

288
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,210
generally speaking now this is good this

289
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,320
is fine but to manually do this every

290
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,880
time you're attacked by something that

291
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,110
may be of interest is horribly intense

292
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,740
from a labor perspective it takes a lot

293
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,350
you typically have to rely on research

294
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,120
labs to provide this level of

295
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,520
information to you or at least you used

296
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:01,410
to so let's talk about sandbox analysis

297
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,300
using artificial intelligence and how

298
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,730
that's used on the offense against cyber

299
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,050
criminals our sandbox solution uses two

300
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,040
analyses when a file comes in there's

301
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,140
another static look that's taken and

302
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,050
again we look at at what type of a file

303
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,540
it is is the PDF is a simple macro is in

304
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,840
a Word document Excel whatever it is and

305
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,630
according to the unpack unwrap analysis

306
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,810
of what we can see we give it an initial

307
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,380
rating within our engine then we go

308
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,840
ahead and detonate it we extract all the

309
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,780
behaviors in the sandbox log the

310
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,790
behaviors are sent to an AI rating

311
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,010
engine and the behaviors themselves

312
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,370
provide us with a 3d cube if you will of

313
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,910
a data point that associates to clusters

314
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,300
of associated malware or clean files

315
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,550
within the system so it's unique to this

316
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,980
sandbox then it adds up all these to

317
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,260
score these scores determines its

318
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,090
placement within this this

319
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,990
three-dimensional model to give not only

320
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,640
if it's now where or not but the

321
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,250
Associated families The Associated code

322
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,140
blocks that were discovered within it

323
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,140
and we use a Bayesian algorithm to do to

324
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,530
create a Radian data point within this

325
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,400
structure this is what provides us with

326
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,500
insight as to

327
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,750
where this malware possibly came from

328
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:40,060
what it was meant to do so this

329
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,340
additional allison analysis that was

330
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,340
provided by the AI engine within this

331
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,290
sandbox is now sent out to determine

332
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,430
what particular pieces of execution

333
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,400
within that mitre framework were used in

334
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,050
this attack and also the severity of it

335
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,200
which means that now we can look at the

336
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,960
critical versus non-critical type of

337
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,840
attack pieces within mitre automatically

338
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,590
and back trail backtrack out to

339
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,260
determine what exactly the cyber

340
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,930
criminals were trying to get at they

341
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,700
probably didn't succeed because we

342
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,560
spotted the code blocks up front on the

343
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,200
AV engine but this additional analysis

344
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,420
gives your engineers now the ability to

345
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,520
actually backtrack and back trace to the

346
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,650
cyber criminal organization itself if

347
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,720
you're provided with the correct data as

348
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,760
far as their campaigns and their

349
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,910
movements etc but you can certainly use

350
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,690
this to determine what's being attacked

351
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,430
and where to apply your security

352
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,770
spending your controls where do we want

353
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,360
to focus our attention what were they

354
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
trying to do what was their intent how

355
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,430
far did they get a lot of times we know

356
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,900
we can't patch and update everything

357
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,420
it's it's it's just impossible it's a

358
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,300
it's a it's a fool's errand to think

359
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,470
that we can keep everything up to date

360
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,359
but if we can see them trying to attack

361
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,770
and how they're attacking it we can

362
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,439
apply appropriate controls so this is

363
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,050
another insight into the cyber criminal

364
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,290
activity the really cool part comes in

365
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,720
from when we start taking this this

366
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,480
machine learning and linking it within

367
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,160
our environment for instance what we've

368
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,530
done is we've created a system where as

369
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,570
we're connected out to the internet with

370
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,160
a couple of different systems let's say

371
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,430
on our perimeter we may have the

372
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,550
firewall or we may have a male employee

373
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,880
male production implementation out there

374
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,780
and it has they have that

375
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,380
Vai protection the CPR all signatures we

376
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,030
talked about built into it

377
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,110
so we have that as a service almost

378
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,310
running in the background of these

379
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,440
products and it doesn't matter it could

380
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,840
be one it could be a dozen but we have

381
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,230
this av baked into a lot of products so

382
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,400
let's say that we get a suspicious

383
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,460
result out of here it blocks it because

384
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,680
you told it anything over 50% surety

385
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,570
kill it we'll take a look at it maybe

386
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,370
well take a look at it happens

387
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,790
automatically now through our sandbox

388
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,350
implementation it fires it in the

389
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,840
sandbox and the miter attack framework

390
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,180
that I showed you earlier is

391
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,520
automatically produced for engineers so

392
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,280
we have AI systems that are feeding

393
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,400
results into an AI powered system to

394
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,380
give you further granularity and clarity

395
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,360
into what's going on within your

396
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,850
environment again that's kind of cool

397
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,180
but not really what you'd call much of

398
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,780
an offensive analysis really I mean you

399
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,340
can dig through and see what they're

400
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,620
trying to get through so we took it to

401
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,830
another level we've started using a Iong

402
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:01,190
campaign analyses of cyber criminals the

403
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,460
silence group was one that we recently

404
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,650
completed and the silence group is a

405
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,210
criminal organization that was

406
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,550
responsible for five major campaigns

407
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,000
they had 436 indicators to compromise

408
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,160
that were we could associate back to

409
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,230
their specific software none of the

410
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,430
things that they'd engineered and

411
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,650
produced they went after 15

412
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,850
vulnerabilities and their attack

413
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,310
patterns we came up with 86 general

414
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,290
attack patterns that we could associate

415
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:37,670
directly back to them so what we did

416
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,310
with this knowledge is we applied it to

417
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,370
that mitre attack framework again we

418
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,690
looked at the criteria to determine if a

419
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,090
specific group meets our candidate

420
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,930
requirements or not and that means that

421
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,670
they had to have so many campaigns so

422
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,350
much activity that we had enough

423
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,530
knowledge on them to

424
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,180
able to build this out into a data

425
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,610
structure the next thing we did was

426
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,490
collected all the information we can

427
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:11,310
went out the st3 Osen yarr rules we have

428
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,270
around half a million sensors around the

429
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,400
planet we collect things from we were

430
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,730
tied out into 140 public of you know

431
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,190
sticks etc that we collect information

432
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,730
from we also have a cyber threat

433
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,940
alliance it's just there's a here's a

434
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,710
weird little science experiment for you

435
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,110
guys so we went out to our competitors

436
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,130
Palo Alto and and Cisco and checkpoint

437
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,110
and all these guys and we created a

438
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,480
consortium to where we all share threat

439
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,210
intelligence amongst ourselves and every

440
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,100
week the group votes on what any one

441
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,150
organization provided and if it's if

442
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,250
it's like they were putting in 50 cents

443
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,710
and pulling out five dollars you get

444
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,630
voted off the island so it's actually

445
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,340
kind of fun to watch everybody

446
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,780
scrambling make sure they're they're

447
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,610
keeping their workload up but anyway so

448
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,310
we collect all this information up then

449
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,320
we do the analysis and we do the

450
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,440
baseline Discovery's multigo analysis

451
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,540
different different types of looks at it

452
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,470
to see if we can figure out hashes and

453
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,960
clusters and relationships between this

454
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,810
malware and its sourcing now right now

455
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,300
this is all manual labor we're training

456
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,700
an AI to be able to pull in all of this

457
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,010
information and actually associate

458
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,410
malware outbreaks with specific groups

459
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,630
based off of these you remember the

460
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,230
pattern of malware versus clean that I

461
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,010
showed you earlier

462
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,870
we're actually using that to associate

463
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,940
cyber criminal group and organization

464
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,430
behaviors and activities so anyways then

465
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,880
we look at the

466
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,250
we research it and plug it into the

467
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,100
mitre attack framework and disseminate

468
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,740
it out to our early partners we do

469
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,720
public releases da da da da da and

470
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,520
that's all fine and interesting and

471
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,430
that's something any good citizen of the

472
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,960
security industry would do for their

473
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,350
customers however in the background what

474
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,830
we're doing is a little bit more further

475
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,990
analysis within this group I talked

476
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,720
about silence earlier there are criminal

477
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,570
organization they're basically looking

478
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,110
for financial exploitation of ATMs they

479
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,750
do a lot of jack potting jack potting is

480
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,500
where you'll you know spear fish or

481
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,890
break into that that ATM and then you'll

482
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,500
have mules come by and pull money out of

483
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:39,800
it

484
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,570
the entire operation is was was

485
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,310
weaponized in these delivery vehicles

486
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,280
Bank officials were finished the even

487
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,800
organizations that provides servicing to

488
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,750
the ATMs they run around putting in cash

489
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,060
et cetera were targeted in these

490
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,510
phishing campaigns so anyways

491
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,180
other a variety of different methods and

492
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,940
ways that were used but basically that

493
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,860
was their main operation the silence

494
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,990
group was big on jack potty you heard

495
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,900
about the one where there was 15 500

496
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,150
million or something pulled in a matter

497
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,190
of 24 hours it was like a year and a

498
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,960
half ago this was the group that was

499
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,890
behind that globally so anyways we came

500
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,670
up with the the the specific attack

501
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,820
parameters that they used within these

502
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,160
jack potting schemes and then started

503
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,870
watching general migrations of

504
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,230
codeblocks as they associated with

505
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,390
changes in the group's attack patterns

506
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,820
and methods of attacking these ATMs we

507
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,920
observed activity in Australia Canada in

508
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,650
France Ireland Latvia Netherlands Poland

509
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,380
Spain Sweden in the USA and we actually

510
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,590
were able to build cluster maps based

511
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,230
off of the locations of the attacks from

512
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,570
a local and global perspective and come

513
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,180
up with probable location within the

514
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,290
dark web of there

515
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,300
CNC servers and things like that so we

516
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,030
built quite a background database on as

517
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,480
far as the intelligence gathering so

518
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,100
then what we did was we took the

519
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,900
individual campaigns and we started

520
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,470
plugging them into the mitre attack

521
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:28,010
again this framework which means that at

522
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,220
this point we have the ability to now

523
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,210
dig deeply in for specific patterns md5

524
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,050
hashes of code blocks as well as those

525
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,520
general patterns of attack and

526
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,260
associated back to the cyber criminal

527
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,410
groups we're plugging this into an

528
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,270
artificial intelligence engine for the

529
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,450
purpose of being able to predict their

530
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,250
next moves and come up with

531
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,740
probabilities a fairly where they'll

532
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,890
attack and how they're going to do it

533
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,710
and it's actually proving to work we're

534
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,840
seeing results with this now this isn't

535
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,960
commercially available yet it's in

536
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,390
developed development stages it will

537
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,160
probably be another year of training

538
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,590
before this is released out so right now

539
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,990
we're turning manually training and

540
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,130
returning these these attack methods

541
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,990
manually teaching in the AI to tear it

542
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,850
apart and extract this specific

543
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,860
information then we have another AI

544
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,500
machine that's doing the Association of

545
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,560
that extraction back to specific cyber

546
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,560
groups cyber criminal groups so that we

547
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,960
can track them and their behavior in a

548
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,900
proactive manner this intelligence is

549
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,000
going to be disseminated out to security

550
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,070
professionals as part of an early

551
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,420
warning system if you will

552
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,180
of expected probabilities of where and

553
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,520
how the next attacks will come from

554
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,470
these types of groups we're doing it

555
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,450
across multiple groups certain size

556
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,000
certain parameters that get met we

557
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,030
select them and we analyze them so

558
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,500
artificial intelligence is in the

559
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,060
background proactively grabbing code

560
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,690
blocks for a static analysis then we're

561
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,400
grabbing in a sandbox malware breakdowns

562
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,380
and patterns of attacks to be able to

563
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,420
associate it back to your systems then

564
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,410
we're extracting that information

565
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,580
further

566
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,920
back into looking at patterns of attacks

567
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,250
that relate to specific cyber crime

568
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,390
cyber criminal groups around the globe

569
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,890
so where are we

570
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,570
AI capabilities currently that we've

571
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,380
built out this AV system I told you

572
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,230
about this static and by the way AI is

573
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,170
the most blah-blah-blah thing in the

574
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,170
universe right now just uh anybody ever

575
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,420
play BS bingo do you know what that game

576
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,110
is it was really funny when I first got

577
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,610
into IT twenty years ago

578
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,650
security 20 years ago we'd go to

579
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,110
conferences and some clown like me would

580
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,550
be up on the stage going you know I have

581
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,320
to synergize and think out of the box to

582
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,760
be able to you know I miss all this blah

583
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,100
that doesn't mean anything

584
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,230
well we built these little cards that

585
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,510
had you know think outside the box and

586
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,480
strategize and all these keywords and we

587
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,640
put him on a bingo card and as he went

588
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,050
through and said these key BS terms we'd

589
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,880
mark it off and whoever got five in a

590
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,890
row wins they'd stand up in the Oh bingo

591
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,230
in the middle of the speech twenty-three

592
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,970
people would laugh a hundred people

593
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,920
would wonder what's going on you know

594
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,180
and AI right now is pretty much like

595
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,510
that

596
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,130
everybody comes in and they start

597
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,360
talking about artificial intelligence

598
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,510
and what they have there's a couple of

599
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,820
points to be made about that deep data

600
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,470
discoveries and things like that

601
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,390
that's not AI that's just simple

602
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,430
algorithms and the other thing is is

603
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,140
that these systems cost a lot and take a

604
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,720
long time to to implement IBM is the

605
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,180
master of AI they came out with deep

606
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,700
blue and Watson and things like that

607
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,950
when I was a little kid which was many

608
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,840
centuries ago before dinosaurs were oil

609
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,840
I used to watch crazy Bobby Fischer a

610
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,690
world champion chess player go up

611
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,110
against Kasparov the Russian chess giant

612
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,990
and I saw deep blue beat Kasparov and

613
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,110
IBM took deep blue and they kept working

614
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,720
on AI and they went up to Watson this

615
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,640
what we understand now we see on TV a

616
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,179
lot they recently tried to

617
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,929
a train an implementation of Watson to

618
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,499
recognize cancer types the stage and

619
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:42,470
provide medical recommendations on how

620
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,809
to treat it

621
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,519
the problem is is they use compressed

622
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:49,639
data sets and accelerated the training

623
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:52,039
of it into a very very short span

624
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,499
thinking that it would be okay and they

625
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,480
showcased it at a big Hospital in Boston

626
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,509
back in the US and it was a miserable

627
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:03,230
failure because of the acceleration etc

628
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,840
so these AI systems are not trivial to

629
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,309
build yeah anyway so we within this AV

630
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:12,110
structure I talked about where we just

631
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,899
pull out those code blocks static code

632
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:15,320
blocks

633
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,389
there's actually three AI engines in

634
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,210
there the first one tears now we're

635
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,299
apart and plays with the golf-ball stack

636
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,039
of features moving them up and down

637
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,740
based off of how often they it sees

638
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,720
these specific pieces and how relevant

639
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,970
they are to them to the problem we have

640
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,980
another one that builds those super

641
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,210
signatures that sorts out new

642
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,649
interesting features from everything

643
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:45,139
coming in and builds out these these

644
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:47,090
super signatures then we have a third

645
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,580
one down there Clyde and what he does is

646
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,619
he provides quality assurance to what

647
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:56,659
this guy produces the second one that we

648
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,909
talked about a little the sandbox

649
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:01,730
artificial intelligence does a static

650
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,549
and dynamic to a ice built into that we

651
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:06,379
have another one in the background that

652
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:08,809
goes out every night and looks at URLs

653
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:13,100
any new URLs within the internet it

654
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,179
takes NAT new and it runs through a huge

655
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:20,570
analysis using letter replacement for

656
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,570
the entire string one letter for a

657
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,879
letter a letter for a number a letter

658
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,970
for a special character and it runs the

659
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,460
entire string against known patterns and

660
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,539
then it goes back through and it looks

661
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,700
for sourcing ownership Whois information

662
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,580
etc everything that it can pull and it

663
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,350
takes all this and puts it back into

664
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,889
that data cube and relates it out to

665
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:44,690
whether a site is malicious or not but

666
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,600
it also relates its

667
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,440
back to the organizations in

668
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,840
cybercriminals that owned that

669
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,450
particular URL or suspected of owning it

670
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,460
and so it's another relational piece

671
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,510
that we plug into this we have work

672
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,820
we're actually building up AI system

673
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,530
that'll be a standalone box that sits on

674
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,059
networks this is kind of cool

675
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:09,100
it takes you remember that that

676
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,559
golf-ball stack of features the most

677
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,390
important ones up at the top it takes a

678
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,630
slice of that off and uses it for an

679
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,890
on-site static analysis that it also

680
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,960
takes all of your traffic all the files

681
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,919
in a training mode and learns what type

682
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,289
of traffic and files are normal for your

683
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:32,580
environment and starts to build out the

684
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,289
malicious and clean feature sets locally

685
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,909
then we have adaptive endpoint learning

686
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:41,590
we have another one sits on your phone

687
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,049
or server or whatever and it does a

688
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:47,669
two-week learning of normal behavior and

689
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:51,580
then starts picking up potential

690
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,710
anomalies and it works on network

691
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,200
traffic open ports activity time zones

692
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,090
even websites that are looked at by mean

693
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,400
by the individual you take up

694
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,789
fly-fishing or what's the latest one

695
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:08,770
aqua gardening does anybody do aqua

696
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,559
gardening in here

697
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,600
no you yeah so everywhere I've gone I

698
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,220
met people that do I didn't know what it

699
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,169
was until two days ago but anyway so you

700
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:22,030
start surfing new sites what it does is

701
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,970
it creates bubbles of normalcy that you

702
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,799
can play within now are the big there

703
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,900
are big no knows that alerts on like

704
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,760
you're trying to gain unauthorized

705
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,490
access or all sudden you're downloading

706
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,350
a ton of files you shouldn't that's

707
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,970
that's the dumb stuff what we're looking

708
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,880
for is is very subtle anomalous behavior

709
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,090
within that user base or the server

710
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,179
platform but anyway so these are systems

711
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:49,030
we have up and running now what about

712
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,669
cyber criminals and where are they and

713
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,690
by the way these are all linked together

714
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,400
to provide that kind of offensive

715
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,010
outlook and it's also feeding

716
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,170
that larger AI system in the background

717
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,090
that we're building for cyber criminal

718
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,010
organization identification and

719
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,990
hopefully eradication we're looking to

720
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,030
get rid of them the whole point of all

721
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,490
of this is to make it too expensive for

722
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,320
cyber criminals to be able to attack

723
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,770
your organization anyways I've got ten

724
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,270
minutes so I often get asked what about

725
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:26,040
the cyber criminals what are they doing

726
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,300
most places I go to somebody will

727
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,130
invariably say well when do you think

728
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,930
the cyber criminals are going to start

729
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:40,020
using AI and it's already happened a

730
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,340
friend and I were kind of snooping

731
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,650
around the dark level a little bit into

732
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:50,230
a chat room on layer six or so and sure

733
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,520
enough they're shopping for four skills

734
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,010
you know and darknet you can get humans

735
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,080
and guns and drugs and they're you know

736
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,080
everything well this was a skills kind

737
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,140
of a sharing where people could get

738
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,469
hired for providing services and a

739
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,570
question popped up on the board saying I

740
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,659
need somebody was strong Python and AI

741
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,719
background who's got it and within a

742
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,639
couple of minutes there

743
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,560
were four or five answers right away yes

744
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,719
I built AI systems I've done this and

745
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,699
all that uh here's what it char what I

746
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,639
charge per hour in Bitcoin or you know

747
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,790
whatever they were using for the base

748
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,280
give me a give me a ring back and so

749
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,080
cyber criminals are already building AI

750
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,879
systems what are they mainly doing with

751
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,210
it

752
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,879
the first one is AI fuzzing and zero-day

753
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:42,580
mining fuzzing is low-level attacks

754
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,710
typically against a system to try to

755
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,710
determine if a series of these low-level

756
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,020
attacks will provide access break the

757
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,719
system to where you can penetrate

758
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:55,480
establish your foothold so AIS are being

759
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,000
used to fuzz systems already and it's

760
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,710
fairly easy to do if you think about it

761
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,290
because the vulnerabilities the CVEs are

762
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:05,200
all published out there you train a

763
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,520
system to

764
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,170
to to do the basic attacks with with all

765
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,140
types of open-source software or things

766
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,869
on available for purchase and basically

767
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:19,270
you can train a system fairly quickly to

768
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,860
fuzz an Apache implementation or

769
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,200
whatever you have sequel server the

770
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,840
other thing that they're interested in

771
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,400
is machine poisoning and this is kind of

772
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,119
interesting from my perspective because

773
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,680
you remember that golf-ball stack of

774
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,560
features that I talked about that's the

775
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,869
real gold of an AI system they're

776
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:46,300
stacked in their order of importance

777
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,720
within the system if you can insert

778
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,210
false information into that stack you've

779
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,080
subvert the ability for the AI system to

780
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,050
provide the correct solution for

781
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,570
instance there was a system that was

782
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,540
recently built that recognized dogs and

783
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,150
it would recognize cross breeds of dogs

784
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,869
and they were demonstrating it and they

785
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,600
put up a picture of a husky and let the

786
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,150
thing and it said wolf a little

787
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,770
embarrassed they got another picture of

788
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,380
a husky and fed it in came back as wolf

789
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,540
and they found out that they were

790
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,300
training it what was new all the things

791
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,700
that weren't dogs cats and ferrets and

792
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,640
rats and mice and giraffes and wolves

793
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,550
were in there as well but when they fed

794
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,350
it pictures of wolves there was always

795
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,720
snow in the background the Husky

796
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,550
pictures all had snow in the background

797
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,640
and it's averted that data stack to give

798
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,760
wrong information or so the AI was led

799
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,560
down the path of providing wrong

800
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,010
information that's a form of AI

801
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,080
poisoning stack poisoning and cyber

802
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,609
criminals are trying to figure out how

803
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:05,290
to send files into systems like I

804
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:09,280
described before that have inserted

805
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,820
pieces within it to throw the AiAi off

806
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,090
and put in things in importance in

807
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,020
orders that aren't necessarily relevant

808
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,600
- the problem being addressed the last

809
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,970
one is swarm technology we're starting

810
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,750
see a is implementing low level a is

811
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,240
being implemented implemented within

812
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,670
swarms and what they're able to do is

813
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,680
autonomously change targets change

814
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,660
attack methods and techniques based off

815
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,190
of the intelligence they collect and

816
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:45,670
share amongst that small swarm so I hope

817
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,290
I gave you some insight on where this is

818
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,840
going with with this whole cyber

819
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,530
security AI picture on the offense what

820
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,510
we want to do again is make it too

821
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,000
expensive to be a cyber criminal or make

822
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,740
them get so creative it takes them

823
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,660
longer to get to the table for their

824
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,900
attacks currently just with those code

825
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,760
blocks that we're extracting the URLs

826
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,890
that we extract the information that we

827
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,020
link everything to we're getting into

828
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,370
the point of being able to predict their

829
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,140
behavior and this is where we want to go

830
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,990
to with with this whole artificial

831
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,050
intelligence movement and being able to

832
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,200
offensively track down these rings and

833
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,740
deal with them stuff to remember like I

834
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,950
said earlier it's it's just it's not

835
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,570
trivial if somebody comes in and pitches

836
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,910
AI and they're like yeah last year we

837
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,560
made one and it's really cool and it

838
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,090
does everything you know bakes bread and

839
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,520
it'll wash your car and feed your dog no

840
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,510
that's not how it works this particular

841
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,000
system that we built took us 10 years to

842
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,340
get it to a maturity state today to

843
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,650
where that accuracy is extremely high it

844
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,660
was five and a half years just to train

845
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,910
this system and that took a lot of

846
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,000
people money technology a huge

847
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,720
investment so it's not trivial the other

848
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,790
thing is it should ease technical

849
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,150
resource demands and build trust within

850
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,370
your organization if you're implementing

851
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,100
an AI and you have to watch it and tell

852
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,510
what's right and what's wrong it's

853
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,820
probably one of those five minute you

854
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,600
know put baked solutions again ai isn't

855
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,830
something that you just throw in the air

856
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,870
and it pops out into something pretty

857
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,420
unless on the floor takes a lot of

858
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,660
effort

859
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,990
as a point specific solution AI is

860
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,180
extremely limited when you start

861
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,130
connecting them and sharing that

862
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,630
information across different platforms

863
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,279
and building more and more of these

864
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,009
layers that have responsibility to find

865
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,289
something and you join those layers into

866
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:48,900
a result this is where AI gets to be

867
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,740
powerful the single point solutions of

868
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,549
being able to do being able to find

869
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:58,529
malware through that AV system that I

870
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,869
described I mean it's nice it's cool it

871
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:04,799
works but the real power of AI is in the

872
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:06,990
connection of it feeding the output data

873
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,240
into another AI system into another AI

874
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,160
system this is where you start getting

875
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,630
the surety of results that you need with

876
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:12,930
it

877
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,029
anybody that pitches it without some

878
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,700
knowledge is probably just doing that BS

879
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,099
bingo kind of thing on you so be careful

880
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:24,900
of it now I always get asked this at the

881
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,849
end as well whereas AI at and where is

882
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:33,690
it going right now we're in the dumb pet

883
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:38,160
trick stage of AI it does complex things

884
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,769
it flies drones around the globe at

885
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:43,109
hypersonic speeds a dozen times and and

886
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,230
lands it on a carrier in the middle of

887
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,549
the Pacific drives cars and all kind of

888
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,859
thing but it but we're still at this

889
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,599
very very brick dumb kind of level of

890
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,990
artificial intelligence the second level

891
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,720
is going to be where it's healing its

892
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,509
own code writing its own code to improve

893
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:06,750
itself the third stage of AI comes in

894
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,460
when the AI wakes up in the morning and

895
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,559
gets lazy and decides it doesn't want to

896
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,150
go to work so it creates another AI to

897
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,269
do its job for it this is going to

898
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:17,609
require vast amounts of computing power

899
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,980
I think there's going to be a

900
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,890
convergence of technologies in this

901
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,539
field and it's going to be around

902
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:27,230
quantum computing and AI coming together

903
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,880
I saw an article the other day that

904
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,000
there was a solution found to quantum

905
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,519
fuzziness if you will schrödinger's cat

906
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,680
experiment where you don't know until

907
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,240
you look it could be either state

908
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,650
plagues

909
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,869
the implementation of quantum computers

910
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:47,880
today that in room temperature

911
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,410
commercially available super

912
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,380
conductivity for the systems once we

913
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,700
solve those two issues

914
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,950
we'll see quantum computing kick off and

915
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,930
that means billions of times of compute

916
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,960
power within the same or smaller space

917
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,359
now will be available to us I think at

918
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,519
that point we will be able to build the

919
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,529
AIS that take the ability to do tasks

920
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,210
such as getting up out of my

921
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,059
presentation thinking eyes he's a little

922
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:16,529
guy that was kind of fun I guess and

923
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:18,150
going accounting and getting a cup of

924
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,099
coffee all the balance the

925
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,460
proprioceptive input jostling in line

926
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,259
seeing who's moving where billions of

927
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:27,299
little computations are going on as you

928
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:28,950
go get that cup of coffee

929
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,589
for us to be able to build intelligent

930
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:33,089
systems that can do things like that

931
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,559
make those kind of decisions and

932
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,900
implement them will require billions of

933
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,319
layers that consists of billions or

934
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,309
possibly trillions of nodes so anyways

935
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:46,410
there's the background my knowledge of

936
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,450
AI and how it's going to be applied for

937
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,609
the offense in the security industry I

938
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,529
hope you enjoyed the talk and I really

939
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,509
do appreciate your time and you being

940
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:57,469
here thank you so much
