1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,030
so good afternoon everybody it's a sleep

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,700
show my arse assume it works I am

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,309
Quentin Taylor I'm actually head of

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,920
information security at at Canon Europe

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,019
and I'm not here to do a sales

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,299
presentation nothing of what I'm going

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,160
to talk about today is to do with sales

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,740
I don't get mandated on sales what I

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,710
want to talk today about it's about

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,140
printing and IOT and print security and

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,939
a lot of the things I'm going to talk

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,150
about today exist across all of the

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,800
manufacturers so I'm kind of here as a

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,380
as an ambassador for the print industry

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,719
if I if you will rather than actually

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,489
anything for any particular company I'm

17
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,790
so I want to talk today about IOT

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,190
imprinting and really I like to call it

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,809
the unloved elephant in the room because

20
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,879
it's the one thing that all of you have

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,340
got is the one bit of office IOT that

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,350
every single one of you has in your

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,969
office somewhere I know we've all talked

24
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,250
about paperless many many times people

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,750
have talked about paperless and yet we

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,370
all still have printers sitting in our

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,559
office and yet they're all sitting there

28
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,739
and for very good reasons or very bad

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,710
reasons sometimes they're unsecured and

30
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,090
they're not looked after and they're

31
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,799
unloved but why and we'll come on to

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,810
that in a minute if you any questions

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,250
just stick your hand up we can talk

34
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,040
about questions at any time but before

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,250
we get on to office IOT if you ask

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,990
somebody on the street what do they mean

37
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,900
by IOT everyone seems to think that it's

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,670
a brand new term because we like to

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,890
that's humans we like to sell IOT is new

40
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,049
and we've got things from the smart cars

41
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,310
to smart assistants to smart heating and

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,740
smart TVs and these all come with

43
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,270
security concerns security issues the

44
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,890
smart assistance at the moment are

45
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,750
having some issues at the moment we're

46
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,280
actually Amazon for example and Google

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,960
having some issues where people are

48
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,790
talking about that it starts to record

49
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,070
so if I say ok Google not a single

50
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,390
person's phone bleep that's really

51
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,740
annoying you should have started

52
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,719
recording my thing in testing in the

53
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,890
office in the Callen office

54
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,350
I must get five people's phones suddenly

55
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,619
bleeping smart assistants really really

56
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,150
good if you're ever on a conference call

57
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,670
top tip if you're born on a conference

58
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,190
call and someone goes to the toilet and

59
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,530
everyone's working from home start just

60
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,610
going echo Amazon okay computer these

61
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,620
are all the wait words for for Amazon

62
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,260
and see if you can make an order before

63
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,760
they get back and if you can't make an

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,989
order because they've been sensible and

65
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,550
turned off' ordering just set an alarm

66
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,989
for like two three o'clock in the

67
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,420
morning because I'm childish yes I did

68
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,980
that in a conference call it was very

69
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,030
very very funny although really

70
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,800
annoyingly one of my colleagues on the

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,750
conference call told the operations

72
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,129
manager that that's what I done to his

73
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,019
thing via direct message about ten

74
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,580
minutes afterwards and he complained it

75
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,230
to me and so that's just being very pure

76
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,819
I'll but anyway so this is what people

77
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,550
start to think about people think about

78
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,959
the Smart TVs and they think about the

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,580
security issues and we even had it the

80
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,200
other day where Samsung actually

81
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,760
announced them that you should probably

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,489
virusscan your Smart TVs I'm not

83
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,680
entirely sure that that tweet or that

84
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,409
bit of advice was was met with well a

85
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:08,940
lot of people actually said maybe you

86
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,140
should just build them so they don't

87
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,290
need virus scanning but what we're

88
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,790
getting here is these things are just

89
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,819
becoming data-gathering devices and

90
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,470
what's very interesting about these and

91
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,230
I contrast these with office IOT is with

92
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,349
all of the devices here you don't

93
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,409
actually own these devices really yeah

94
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,110
sure you owned the piece of plastic and

95
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,319
the piece of glass you own the piece of

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,599
plastic and the power cable but you

97
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,760
don't actually own the data and that's

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,340
the reason why they're so cheap I mean I

99
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,909
bought a

100
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:44,220
Amazon one and now they're giving them

101
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,099
away for free the Smart TV prices are

102
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,830
going down so they're offsetting the

103
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,590
costs of these devices alongside the

104
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,970
data they can get that's the reason why

105
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,950
Smart TVs are so cheap these days is

106
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,540
because they can sell the data

107
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,159
legitimately you signed up to all those

108
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,750
you LA's which you did read before you

109
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,760
clicked I accept to make your Smart TV

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,180
work and so basically they're offsetting

111
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,540
the costs of all of these devices but

112
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,769
it's different when you move into the

113
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,410
corporate environment

114
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,339
because IOT in really is nothing new

115
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,200
it's been in the office for absolutely

116
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,269
years and years and years and years but

117
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,390
we just didn't call it IOT and some dumb

118
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,250
devices and inverted commas are becoming

119
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,670
smart so let's look a bit of IOT in the

120
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,340
office so projectors or beamers or

121
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,600
whatever what you call them here in

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
Singapore projectors projectors okay

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,730
sorry I often call them Bemis cuz I

124
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,800
lived in Holland for like 10 years and

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,960
those couldn't bhima's over there in in

126
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,820
England a beamer is a BMW but anyway

127
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,650
they call them Bemis so projectors or

128
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,790
beams or wherever you come from the

129
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,350
world whatever you call them they're all

130
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,510
now majority nor wireless and actually

131
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,890
that's really good because whenever I

132
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,360
get my laptop I need to plug into

133
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,070
something I'm often sitting there going

134
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,080
now I've had this laptop for four years

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,360
and I still don't know which side the

136
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,980
connectors are on anybody else have that

137
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,540
problem where you just sit there

138
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,030
randomly just going where is it you

139
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,590
suddenly start to remember laptop so you

140
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,000
go around the back and go no that was a

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,880
laptop like 10 years ago anywho so these

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,160
things are actually quite useful so

143
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,120
network connections on them so you can

144
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,710
just project straight to them very very

145
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:21,240
useful its CCTV cameras no one installs

146
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,780
non IOT CCTV cameras these days and in

147
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,360
actual fact security issues abound with

148
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,400
CCTV cameras the Mirai botnet Mirai 2

149
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,260
and everything else depended upon the

150
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,510
CCTV cameras cuz with these you've got

151
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,260
the perfect combination of IOT that's

152
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,430
sitting high up on the side of a

153
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,810
building that no one even cares it

154
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,940
exists up there with large amounts of

155
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,710
bandwidth because if you're streaming 4k

156
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,720
or even on some other modern or the real

157
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,670
absolute bleeding a ccd cameras

158
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,550
sometimes even maybe even 8k you could

159
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,470
have insane amounts of bandwidth going

160
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,720
to these things you have

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,940
videoconferencing systems that are

162
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,820
sitting out there and these are often

163
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,830
just totally ignored I'm old enough to

164
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,720
remember when they were only really IIST

165
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,730
yen and now obviously they're not and of

166
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,050
course you've got printers and I'm gonna

167
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,720
come on to those in a minute but what's

168
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,800
interesting about all of these things

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,370
here is everyone here in presuming has

170
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,550
heard of shadow brokers the group of

171
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,190
people who allegedly try to sell a large

172
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,120
number of NSA exploits now what's

173
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,710
interesting

174
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,300
what link shadow broker sir this is

175
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,130
Sochi shadow brokers are the people who

176
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,110
release the eternal blue exploit the NSA

177
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,910
exploit that was behind one a cry and

178
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,740
not Pecha they did a lot of the heavy

179
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,270
lifting and both of those two malware

180
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,120
outbreaks and bad rabbit as well but if

181
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,070
you remember there's something else that

182
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:45,440
that the the what they called shadow

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,270
brokers pill released in their first

184
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,640
ever release they released a manifest a

185
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,470
shipping manifest because their initial

186
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,210
thing was that you could actually buy a

187
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,000
subscription to their service and if you

188
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,410
did they apparently would give you all

189
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,090
these NSA exploits and bleed them out to

190
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,280
you a few a month now I read that

191
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,720
shipping manifest this was just a list

192
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,430
of all the wares that they claimed to

193
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,860
have like they're like a catalog if you

194
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,610
will and what was very interesting is

195
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,520
projectors CCTV and video conferencing

196
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,300
were all in their manifest and why why

197
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,940
does the NSA care about hacking these

198
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,800
devices printers weren't at she I was

199
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,150
really really surprised I thought they'd

200
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,170
been in there that was a bit annoying

201
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,430
they weren't in there they must have a

202
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,380
list of printers must been on another

203
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,360
page but why do they do it well they had

204
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,970
a whole section a whole directory and

205
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,990
all the different video conferencing

206
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,270
equipment and and why do they care at BC

207
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,610
equipment well because vc equipment

208
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,970
tends to be not run by IT tends to sit

209
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,140
there in in a meeting room by its very

210
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,180
definition it has a high-definition

211
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,310
camera or some kind of camera it also

212
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,920
has some kind of audio

213
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,600
and its connectable to the outside world

214
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,440
because of course your video

215
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,210
conferencing system you don't be running

216
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,980
on an intranet no no you have to be to

217
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,870
reach out over the net so what better

218
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,910
way of bugging systems than the video

219
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,850
conferencing systems but i'd i jarrett

220
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,710
digress because i want to talk to you

221
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,630
about printers because you might not

222
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,820
have well you probably have CCTV but you

223
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,370
may not have some of these things but i

224
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,900
guarantee you've got printers in your

225
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,060
office and there's a problem with

226
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,080
printers and one of the problems with

227
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,400
prentices a lot of people just don't

228
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
know of the threats all the

229
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,640
opportunities that these things can

230
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,010
bring because they're not perceived as

231
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,290
being cool print vendors on occasion

232
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,790
don't take see eyes out to lunch and

233
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,039
they tend to a lot of times printers sit

234
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,409
not under IT but they sit under

235
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,880
facilities I mean quick shower hands

236
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,328
here

237
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:40,249
who's got whose corporate printers sit

238
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:43,759
under facilities and not IT nobody

239
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,379
brilliant I love this audience you're

240
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:50,389
all good people you can all stay we like

241
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:52,639
this and coz they've been in there for

242
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,739
such a long time and the feature sets

243
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:56,749
have been changing over the time people

244
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,100
just don't understand the kind of things

245
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,249
that they can now do I mean let's just

246
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,749
look at this and talk about our printers

247
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,999
really IT equipment well with a printer

248
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:07,549
you can scan to email so great if you

249
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:09,679
want exfiltrate data out of a building

250
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,420
I'm fairly sure from when we saw your

251
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,920
presentation about reading whose body

252
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,809
language I'm fairly sure you probably

253
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:17,059
have used a printer to email documents

254
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,649
out is a very quick way so you don't get

255
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,899
caught by physical security you can scan

256
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,939
out to file shares you can scan out to

257
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,529
cloud you couldn't get from documents

258
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:26,809
from various cloud services of course

259
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:28,850
then also they are keeping all the

260
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,160
credentials if they're configured to do

261
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,379
so to these cloud services so that you

262
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,749
can log on to them obviously integrate

263
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,489
with Active Directory so they're fully

264
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:39,199
logged on to Active Directory so that

265
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,149
you can compromise a printer potentially

266
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,319
you can get an endpoint that's got a

267
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:45,379
full list of all the ad objects and you

268
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,879
can also connect mobile phones and

269
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,350
dedicated mobile apps in and they'll

270
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,410
have Bluetooth and they'll have Wi-Fi

271
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,850
and they'll have network connections and

272
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,860
they'll probably have a modem in there

273
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,079
if they're actually doing faxes and I'm

274
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,910
sure and this didn't affect ours but I'm

275
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,919
sure you all saw at Def Con last year

276
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,519
with HP and fax Floyd fax plate was

277
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,290
really really interesting and it hats

278
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,730
off to the checkpoint people for doing

279
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,860
some superb research where they worked

280
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,249
out some of the newer more newer X

281
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,619
extensions to the fax protocol for color

282
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:18,470
fax machines would allow you to actually

283
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,899
compromise the printer itself and

284
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,199
actually jump from the phone line

285
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,179
straight through onto the Ethernet

286
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:29,480
network now that's a scary scary scary

287
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,699
proposition that if you've got some of

288
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:32,989
these things sitting on your network and

289
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,660
you don't have a guarantee that you've

290
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,639
got a modem sitting directly connected

291
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,749
to your Ethernet network

292
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,610
well that would concern me if I wasn't

293
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,079
actually monitoring the security of it

294
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,259
oh they can also print as well um and a

295
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,879
lot of people start to think about if

296
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,710
you print something out

297
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,960
and therefore it becomes a physical data

298
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,090
breach is that actually the

299
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,940
responsibility of the seaso I mean for

300
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,890
example in your organization's if there

301
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,680
was a printed material data breach would

302
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,570
you consider that to be under your

303
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,100
responsibility or do you say no that's

304
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,240
facilities or that's physical security

305
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,450
where would you say that would sit

306
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,840
you're very talkative crowd I like this

307
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,460
it's information and there's important

308
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,820
here which is like it or lump it the CSO

309
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,710
is chief information security officer

310
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,840
not chief information technology

311
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,300
security officer or anything else but so

312
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,470
we have to kind of take these things

313
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,060
seriously and have to start looking at

314
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,240
this and a long long time ago we used to

315
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,820
have servers on the desks and it's funny

316
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,210
actually because there's but there's a

317
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,950
yes there's a van anecdote that I have I

318
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,360
don't it was anybody else in the room

319
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,580
with Dave Lewis from Cisco from

320
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,940
jerusaiem at data breaches where they

321
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,060
found a Reuter under a desk and I was

322
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,670
under a floorboard and I was talking him

323
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,020
after's about that I had a similar one

324
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,030
where we found a server under a desk and

325
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,710
I powered it off because it was having

326
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,270
some problems and then discovered that

327
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,250
you it was a printing server and managed

328
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,520
to jam up about 200 trucks in southern

329
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Holland but a printer is just that it's

330
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,280
a server that isn't stored in the server

331
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,080
room it's got all of these things it may

332
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,030
even have multiple amounts of file

333
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,610
storage it may even have raid sitting in

334
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,990
there it's got all of these things it's

335
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,060
got an operating system the operating

336
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,070
systems on most printers or in fact

337
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,690
almost every single printer sitting out

338
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,640
there today is an operating system out

339
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,490
there that you will know it'll be one of

340
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,920
two on the newer stuff and I guarantee

341
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,750
you'll know both operating systems you

342
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,680
can guess which two they are and around

343
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,690
2017 there's a really good website he

344
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,890
would hacking printers don't know it's

345
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,030
nothing to do with us nothing to do with

346
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,890
me but I do like that the website and

347
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,930
they revealed that you can hack printers

348
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,760
with postscript commands now a lot of

349
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
people think of PostScript and think of

350
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,780
it as a print format and it kind of is

351
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,090
but it's so much more than that

352
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,360
PostScript is a total a scripting

353
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,130
language so you can actually write a

354
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,030
document

355
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,280
that has complete scripting language

356
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,800
commands in there so you can say load

357
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,230
this into memory and if the next

358
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,940
document that comes along to the printer

359
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,580
contains the word Quentin tailor and

360
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,910
demotion change the D to promotion and

361
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,640
that's a completely valid thing I mean

362
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,370
could you imagine having users emailing

363
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,400
Perl scripts or emailing some scripting

364
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,070
languages around and then executing them

365
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,780
on hardware devices that you maybe you

366
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,590
don't run well

367
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,630
PostScript is is very very similar to

368
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,970
that and if you're not aware of what's

369
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,860
going on if you're not aware of are you

370
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,150
actually controlling this are you

371
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,860
actually aware are you verifying that

372
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,690
the veracity of the documents floating

373
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,020
around this kind of stuff can happen and

374
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,300
this research there was 2017 and we're

375
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,040
in 2019 but with all of those things

376
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,770
going on it's really really really easy

377
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,060
really easy to focus on the negative

378
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,400
aspects and what I want to talk to you

379
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,740
today about is and again this is this is

380
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,120
probably common across most of the

381
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,010
different manufacturers that there are

382
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,890
huge areas where printers can actually

383
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:18,140
add to your security arsenal and if

384
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,750
you've got to have them you may as well

385
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,190
sort out the the security issues but

386
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,840
then actually turn them into a security

387
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,390
bonus so let's think about security

388
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,560
bonuses so this actually was a company I

389
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,230
worked with and they had a large number

390
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,000
of people who would come in every couple

391
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,150
of months to visit them and they were

392
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,310
flying in on airlines that didn't do

393
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,130
online check-in so they all had to print

394
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,630
out boarding documents and they had to

395
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,820
print out different details and so they

396
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,830
needed to print out a lot of data when

397
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,230
they came in and they were actually

398
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,930
creating Active Directory accounts just

399
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,940
for printing and so therefore what was

400
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,620
happening was not enough idear accounts

401
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,820
being created and to be honest you don't

402
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,590
be creating large numbers of ad accounts

403
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,540
for guest users so what people were

404
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,470
doing was they were emailing

405
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,990
confidential data around eventually the

406
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,820
company seaso got involved and said

407
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,040
actually I'm gonna hire two people who

408
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,080
are gonna sit there with a computer each

409
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,060
and they're gonna handle every single

410
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,190
person's printing to get rid of the

411
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,270
security issue because that was

412
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,870
considered by that C so

413
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,330
to be easier than actually generating

414
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,000
all these Active Directory accounts well

415
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,670
you actually can turn on guest print

416
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,920
where you can just email documents in

417
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,300
and songs you trust your email system

418
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,980
the printer picks them up from the email

419
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,960
system and then sends a guest code

420
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,430
through and the user just literally

421
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,490
walks up to the printer types the guest

422
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,740
code in and gets their documents out and

423
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,570
they can't leave anything on the paper

424
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,930
tray because things being found on the

425
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,520
paper tray I mean who here for example

426
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
has walked around a building and has

427
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,540
found large amounts of data lurking on

428
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,690
it yeah I know because that's and would

429
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,860
you say that's one of the first places

430
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,180
that use that sorry it just if you

431
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,530
weren't shockers presentation yes they

432
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,700
was talking about red teaming and

433
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,680
talking about you know so talk to about

434
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,210
red teaming but I imagine it's probably

435
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,530
one of your greatest source of

436
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,910
information is go grab stuff off the

437
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,720
paper tray exactamundo see if you can

438
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,490
stop stuff being left on the paper tray

439
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,570
and you can stop something left on the

440
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,400
paper tray for guess isn't that a great

441
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,100
thing and if you can stop you having to

442
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,410
create Active Directory account just for

443
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,560
guests isn't that a great thing well yep

444
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,850
and it's right possible to do that there

445
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,840
follow me printing it's what we were

446
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,760
talking about before website or if it's

447
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,190
two seconds ago if you've got printers

448
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,440
and you're not logging on to the printer

449
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,020
before you allow the users to print you

450
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,330
have a problem I mean if you just have

451
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,010
it where you just have a print queue set

452
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,420
up and you just press print and stuff

453
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,680
just comes out the printer over there

454
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,360
you have a problem because people are

455
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,100
going to print stuff and just not pick

456
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,930
it up people are going to print stuff

457
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,480
printers do jam printers do run out of

458
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,160
paper people printers do run out of town

459
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,930
or whatever else they're going to pick

460
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,480
up half of their job and then someone's

461
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,680
going to come along fix the printer

462
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,030
because no one ever bothers fixing a

463
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,110
printer but again someone's gonna fix

464
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,640
the printer and sewing the rest of that

465
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,280
print jobs gonna come out or worse than

466
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,780
that actually what happened in several

467
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,959
UK councils is where two people send

468
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,700
some very confidential print jobs and

469
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,470
someone picks up half the print job and

470
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,640
the other person picks up the other half

471
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,440
of the print job and they accidentally

472
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,030
mix the print jobs up and send them to

473
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,849
two different customers and under

474
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,709
European legislation and GDP are

475
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,900
depending what data was sent that there

476
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,329
is actually a sink an be a significant

477
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,660
data breach so logging onto printers is

478
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,640
a really really just a it's

479
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,040
your security 101 there's another one in

480
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,480
content hardening in a minute but if you

481
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,250
don't you're hardening you want to be

482
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,020
logging on to printers you want to be

483
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,190
logging on those with Active Directory

484
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,130
with some kind of RFID card or something

485
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,440
else and before I get onto the RFID

486
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,650
carpet just be aware of how your RFID

487
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,200
cards are working anybody here familiar

488
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,850
to everyone played with the proxmark or

489
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,400
anyone played around with it's the usual

490
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
suspects

491
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,860
okay so proxmark said you can grab on

492
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,330
eBay they just allow you to play around

493
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,980
with RFID commands and play around with

494
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,250
RFID cards and often what we see with

495
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,440
with printers is when companies go in

496
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,510
and they implement follow me printing

497
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,280
with the badge enable printing for the

498
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,780
first time and they don't do it properly

499
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,870
they base the RFID or they base the

500
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,380
security on the ID number of the card

501
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,910
now if all you're doing is basing the

502
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,100
security on the ID number of the card I

503
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,140
can read and write

504
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,390
Mifare classic cards with my phone if

505
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,310
I've got the right kind of writable

506
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,490
magic card so suddenly it means that I

507
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,930
could pretend to be other people and I

508
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,580
can break your security so if you're

509
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,780
going to do follow me printing and

510
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,400
please do follow me printing and there's

511
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,230
many many ways you can do it just make

512
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,970
sure that if you're doing it with RFID

513
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,250
in any way shape or form that you do

514
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,260
make sure you test it and make sure it's

515
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,330
being implemented in the correct way oh

516
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,360
I should say by the way as well sorry

517
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,370
last bit on follow me printing is it's

518
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,780
one of these security controls that

519
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,730
users love and there aren't many

520
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,890
security controls that users actually

521
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,960
genuinely really really love and there's

522
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,550
reason why they love it is because if

523
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,560
you move around a building have you ever

524
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,460
had it when you've moved around a

525
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,810
building you need to print something and

526
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,670
you're going oh as anyone didn't know

527
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,020
what the print queue is for the printer

528
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,070
over there what's the number of that

529
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,840
printer over there and what what service

530
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,520
sitting on well with with follow-me

531
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,680
printing with any of the manufacturers

532
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,390
you just literally just press print and

533
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,160
then you just log on and when you log on

534
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,050
your printers print jobs come to that

535
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,880
particular printer so users love it in

536
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,930
your service that's love it because they

537
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,270
don't have to reconfigure print queues

538
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,950
when users decide to move around the

539
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:41,400
building hardening printers so

540
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,390
everyone here or you may be familiar

541
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,600
with a website could showdown HQ

542
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,860
basically yeah okay I'm not gonna go

543
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,809
into much detail so show none if you

544
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,850
have a quick look on showdown for port

545
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,070
in ninety one hundred ninety one hundred

546
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,470
is the IP p internet printing protocol

547
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,419
it's got internet and printing protocol

548
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:00,490
so you should have your internet

549
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,720
printing protocol should be on the

550
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,410
internet if you want your printers to be

551
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,970
on the internet and you want people to

552
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,070
be in a print to your printers yes you

553
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,990
can put them on the internet I did a

554
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,360
search a couple of weeks ago and I found

555
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,580
over two hundred and fifty thousand

556
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,750
printers sitting on the internet now

557
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,380
remember what I said about this bit

558
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,120
about being a hack printers by

559
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,169
postscript commands

560
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:29,409
well if you're putting your printers on

561
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:30,970
the internet you've got a magic and

562
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,110
you've got a pro Script interpreter

563
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,190
because a lot of those printers I'll be

564
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,630
really honest with you on the twenty

565
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,530
fifty thousand are gonna be home

566
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,909
printers and they won't have a

567
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,380
full-blown proscriptive interpreter so

568
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,880
let's be really clear here I'm not

569
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,350
saying this 250 thousand honorable

570
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,390
machines but if you are pad your prints

571
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,770
on the internet you would understand

572
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,130
that the very best that can happen to

573
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,830
putting princes on the internet is that

574
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,690
someone's going to print to it and I'll

575
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,520
come into that in a second but the very

576
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,679
worst that can happen is that someone

577
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:58,179
can actually send a malicious print job

578
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:00,190
potentially and cause you serious

579
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,990
problems I'm not just talking about some

580
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,640
what is printing pages and pages and

581
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,230
pages are black like people used to do

582
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,059
on the fax machines of old

583
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,530
I mean people could actually potentially

584
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,809
on some other manufactures model the

585
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,250
printer they can actually overwrite

586
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,630
chips they can cause prints gonna

587
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,130
permanent reboot loops they can

588
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,570
overwrite the firmware there's a whole

589
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,289
load of little things that can be done

590
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,840
but things like following a hardening

591
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,850
guide is a really really great example

592
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,490
it's getting in there just saying why do

593
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,350
I have that turned on why do I have that

594
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,610
because a printer is meant to be all

595
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,679
things to all men to all companies and

596
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:34,030
all manufacturers prints are like this

597
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,950
in default configuration they will come

598
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,360
up with an author reports a lot of

599
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,070
protocols a lot of stuff and if you

600
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,200
don't need it to be there why on earth

601
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,419
would you leave it to be there and the

602
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:44,830
problem is a lot of times its facilities

603
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,240
is configured it or facilities has

604
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,429
brought somebody else in and then you as

605
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:49,990
a security professional maybe didn't get

606
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,790
involved so go grab a hardening guy

607
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,149
because if you don't so this was from

608
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:58,479
mm and is there a date on here there's

609
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,879
not I'm gonna say 2007 teams I can't

610
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:03,249
think of when it was so this was 2017

611
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,559
where someone sent print jobs theta

612
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,839
basically just scan show Dan or whatever

613
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,099
they wanted to use to May you've used

614
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:11,169
math scan and literally it's connected

615
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:12,279
to everything that was sitting on port

616
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,739
9100 and sent this lovely picture

617
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:15,249
through

618
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:18,249
so from Stack Overflow on line two to

619
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,769
the i/o I hacked your printer basically

620
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:21,909
this person was just trying to tell

621
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:22,330
people

622
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,639
please don't connect printers to the

623
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,779
internet and you might notice something

624
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,059
unusual that this you look at the bit of

625
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,639
paper here that isn't a four no that's a

626
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:32,379
receipt printer that was connected to

627
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,099
the Internet

628
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,899
a receipt printer connected the internet

629
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:36,729
so you'd have thought the artist person

630
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:39,669
sent this lovely warning nice friendly

631
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,409
warning even with a MechWarrior

632
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:43,749
reference which I I just I disliked the

633
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:45,700
Macquarie references a part of my

634
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,499
childhood you know thought people

635
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,759
wouldn't have done it any more people

636
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,070
would have turned it off well actually

637
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,960
this fast-forward through to the end of

638
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,599
2018 where someone by the name of

639
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,330
hackage araf who I suspect his English

640
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,379
based upon his his language actually put

641
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:03,429
a thing up to there was something about

642
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:06,279
t-series and PewDiePie - - what they

643
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,169
called - youtubers who were having some

644
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,210
kind of battle to see who could get to

645
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,219
number one in terms of wherever it was

646
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,589
and he was this or he or she to be

647
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,509
honest was sending around huge amounts

648
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:19,359
of prints saying please subscribe to

649
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,849
pure pie that was it and unsubscribe

650
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:25,299
from T series um and this person did it

651
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:28,059
three or four times and literally people

652
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:29,289
were saying all these printers have been

653
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:31,149
hacked and it's like no they haven't

654
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:32,889
these are just printers that are sitting

655
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:35,109
there on the internet or the person did

656
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,639
was connect to port 9100 and just

657
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:38,320
sending a print job and the printer

658
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,479
accepted the print job and printed it

659
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,279
and you'll be surprised at how many

660
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,950
corporates suddenly went my god my

661
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,259
printers are on the internet I remember

662
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,759
these are the printers that convert

663
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,409
handle everything from people printing

664
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,749
their pay slips to printing salary

665
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:54,999
letters to printing sensitive data and

666
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,619
there's that PostScript thing I talked

667
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:59,489
about and yet people are still still in

668
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:02,349
2019 sitting printers on the internet

669
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,940
and maybe you're not aware of it of

670
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,070
those two hundred or thousand people who

671
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,269
have got off the printers that are

672
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:08,429
sitting on the Internet

673
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:11,190
I don't think our large percentage of

674
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,019
them meant to be on the internet so

675
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,559
what's my call to action here if you

676
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,690
recognize there's a risk here you need

677
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,820
to take action and what you need to do

678
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,499
when you're taking action well the first

679
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:27,450
thing is actually say how am i

680
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,220
configured I mean

681
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,419
disable ready here do you do like a

682
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,100
regular scan through your corporate

683
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,539
network just to see what an earth has

684
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,929
suddenly appeared on the inside yeah

685
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:39,210
does everyone do that I do because it's

686
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,190
fun ah some of the back does we like

687
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,240
people at the back do these things

688
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,179
because one day actually about two years

689
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,330
ago I even found the the system that

690
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,039
this gentleman down here is using to

691
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,049
control all of this lot and then much to

692
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,519
my amusement I discover that I could

693
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,690
actually make the screens and the

694
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,070
boardroom go up and down and the

695
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,840
curtains and the boardroom clothes and I

696
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,950
could do it from a different building

697
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,570
and I was playing with it and then

698
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,159
someone said could you stop doing this

699
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,700
please because people don't ask your

700
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,080
internal facility people won't ask

701
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,210
people will go and plug their IOT coffee

702
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,190
machine in they will plug things in and

703
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,720
they have been plugging printers and

704
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,980
various other things into your corporate

705
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,809
networks for years and you need to be

706
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:17,879
aware of them because they can be a risk

707
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,529
and as I've said as well they can also

708
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:21,119
be an advantage but you've got to

709
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,210
recognize that you've got this issue and

710
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,309
so what can you actually do well the

711
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:28,440
first thing is actually assess them I

712
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,570
mean I'm sure all of you have got test

713
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,509
networks or test labs or you can just

714
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:35,429
plug one in into the corporate land next

715
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,710
to your PC and just port scan it and

716
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,509
just have a look I mean if you're gonna

717
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,249
run printers just ask the manufacturer

718
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:42,629
or whoever's installing your print

719
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:45,059
network to say I'm just gonna scan it

720
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,279
when it comes in and if your print

721
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,019
manufacturer or company installed in the

722
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:50,970
network says all I don't want to do that

723
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,499
well maybe you want a different one

724
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:54,059
because they should turn around and say

725
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,759
please go ahead we followed this

726
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,049
hardening guide this is how we've

727
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:00,119
actually set this up and look at the

728
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,499
actual of the applications that are

729
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:03,929
running on the whole print network and

730
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,090
start working out what is it what do

731
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,039
they do how are they actually sending

732
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,440
data around and what's the security

733
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,419
model how do they fail does this fail

734
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,159
open or does this fail close does it

735
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,019
fail in the way that I want it to fail

736
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:20,399
and and don't actually I come on to it

737
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:21,340
here

738
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,590
Factory is no guarantee of quality I

739
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,370
mentioned this here I a long time ago

740
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,120
was dealing with a lock manufacturer who

741
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,530
I don't want to mention but they're a

742
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,450
big big lock manufacturer very

743
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,940
recognizable global brand and they're

744
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,770
just installed locks and our data center

745
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,020
that and the design criteria the date

746
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,430
Center was it was a lights-out data

747
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,780
center so therefore you had to be able

748
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,150
to unlock the locks from our security

749
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,830
location which was about 20 kilometers

750
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,170
away so security could see my face they

751
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,340
could then check to make sure I had

752
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,080
authorization they could press a button

753
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,910
or click an icon and suddenly the lock

754
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,310
could unlock and I could go in and what

755
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,290
we discovered is if you port scanned the

756
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,390
the lock because it was on the internal

757
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,610
network again facilities didn't ask the

758
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,430
lock would actually fail open you would

759
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,740
actually it would actually reboot even

760
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,600
if you crashed a reboot and of course a

761
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,490
lock on a datacenter you don't want it

762
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,020
in a crashed state to be locked

763
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,850
you want it to unlock just in cases of

764
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,470
fire or something else that's caused the

765
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,350
crash but natural fact that was a major

766
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,900
manufacturer of locks and that was

767
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,270
actually no guarantee of quality but

768
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,110
anyway what can you do well understand

769
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,790
that one size doesn't fit all the

770
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,140
manufacturer is probably trying to

771
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,550
create that IOT device not just

772
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,920
principle all the IOT devices to meet

773
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,960
all of the individual office

774
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,150
requirements of all of the individual

775
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,710
customers that they may ever want to

776
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,050
send it into so you're gonna have to

777
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,420
have a quick look and say what decisions

778
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,940
have they made and does that meet what I

779
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,970
want and I mean actually assess it don't

780
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,080
just read the documents read the

781
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,240
documents is great but actually assess

782
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,060
it actually puts can it actually run

783
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,500
your pen testing tools against in

784
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,780
actually ask your red teamers or your

785
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,760
ordinal red teamers maybe but boy your

786
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,980
your your audit team to say hey could

787
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,420
you just run your fuzzer through there

788
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,860
and you just have in a play and just

789
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,420
give it a bit of poke and prod and just

790
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,940
make sure it does what I want it to do

791
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,710
and look at the network traffic the

792
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,590
device is sending don't assume that the

793
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,180
manufacturer is right when they say all

794
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,370
of our packets are encrypted go and have

795
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,020
a look are they actually encrypted

796
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,450
because we tested something an IOT

797
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,060
device and office IOT device and we

798
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,160
discovered that no not all of the data

799
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,080
was encrypted actually all the signaling

800
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,020
information wasn't encrypted which

801
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,400
great because it meant that yes I

802
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,100
couldn't see the actual data but I did

803
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,570
know who was sending it and when they

804
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,010
were sending it and the velocity and

805
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,690
everything else and I could just read it

806
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,130
off in plain text which in reality was

807
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,690
probably all I actually needed I didn't

808
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,400
need to know what the content of the

809
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,140
data was I needed to know who was

810
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,120
talking to WHO and we only found that

811
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,410
from looking at the network traffic and

812
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,610
then when you reported the manufacturer

813
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,680
they go ah yeah we'll fix that the next

814
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,920
version do this device discovery in your

815
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,240
network because users won't ask for

816
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,150
permission I scan my home network the

817
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,590
other day because I'd lost something I

818
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,270
thought I'll be intelligent here in I'll

819
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,770
scan it and I had 46 devices come back

820
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,450
yeah I turned up my au pair was actually

821
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,850
my au pair sorry my kids au pair sorry I

822
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,620
don't have an au pair my kids au pair

823
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,530
had like four mobile devices and even

824
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,230
had a what the called a a VPN proxy

825
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,310
running permanently I picked it well we

826
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,900
picked a decent au pair I'm sorry I

827
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,370
didn't know whether to be shocked or

828
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,170
surprised or really really proud I was

829
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,090
kind of proud of her to do that because

830
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,770
she was routing all of her TV through it

831
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,780
I asked her she just wanted to move it

832
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,910
into the pseudo server room and not run

833
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,470
it in the bedroom we don't run under the

834
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,700
desk servers at home in my house either

835
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,960
and also just work out which of your

836
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,760
devices have got business-critical data

837
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,850
it's really really easy to not actually

838
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,230
map out your business process and just

839
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,970
assume and work out just think it's all

840
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,830
going everywhere and not realize where

841
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,270
the date the business critical data is

842
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,520
and a really true story here was we were

843
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,800
testing a one of our internal printers

844
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,270
and we bought a brand new one and I

845
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,430
needed the design criterion was I wanted

846
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,680
a brand new on out of the case out of

847
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,540
the packing case and we're going to test

848
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,280
it for some things we want to make

849
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,230
guaranteed sure it had never been

850
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,000
configured before so that all the data

851
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,600
on there was clean data and was our data

852
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,220
so we ran some tests on the first day

853
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,250
got bit late we went home came back in

854
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,040
again on the Friday ran some final tests

855
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,080
pulled the hard drives out and started

856
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,820
doing some forensics work just to verify

857
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,830
to get a clean baseline of what data was

858
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,690
there and then we found a whole load of

859
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,760
HR data and we panicked because we're

860
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,020
sitting there going ha ha no no no no

861
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,700
this came clean out of our supply chain

862
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,410
there's no way that HR date can be on

863
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,480
there and then it turned out that we had

864
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,430
left in an unlocked room overnight and

865
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,470
some of the HR had been wandering along

866
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,280
and it's

867
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,510
to beat their print quotas because

868
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,770
they'd found a printer that wasn't

869
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,630
locked that was just not configured and

870
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,220
they just photocopied a load of people's

871
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,560
CVS and stuff and of course when we ran

872
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,390
the test the next morning we found it we

873
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,950
didn't know business-critical data was

874
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,270
sitting on that printer because it

875
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,100
shouldn't have been but you never know

876
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,780
it will get into places that you don't

877
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,500
expect it to be and you've got a tester

878
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,480
but finally what I want to get to here

879
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,400
is don't forget the positives there are

880
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,590
risks there are risks in all of the

881
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,320
office IOT but they're all manageable

882
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,090
they've all been thought of they've all

883
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,490
been there but a lot of companies don't

884
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,110
think about it and it just takes one of

885
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,700
you lot to go back into your office on

886
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,820
Monday do some testing do some scanning

887
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,110
and then start reaching out to people

888
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,330
going look why is that stuff sending

889
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,520
plaintext data on to the internet why is

890
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,440
that not configured in this way why is

891
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,390
that not done in the right way hang in a

892
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,620
second there's a better way of doing

893
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,230
this and suddenly you can improve the

894
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,630
world there are resources there there

895
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,090
are hardening guides there are documents

896
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,650
to explain these are the possibilities

897
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,070
that you've got and really really small

898
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,960
differences just getting to make sure

899
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,370
that you understand where your data is

900
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,750
and making sure that people are logging

901
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,420
on to the printers suddenly can change

902
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,190
everything that's going on so I want to

903
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,320
leave it with this which is the futures

904
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,970
in your hands and I was at a conference

905
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,980
and someone said you represent a

906
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,740
manufacturer so why don't you just do

907
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,960
this by default and I said oh that's

908
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,400
great yes yes well you represent

909
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,670
consumers now why don't consume and

910
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,900
fractures of consumer products just do

911
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,150
this by default because manufacture will

912
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,790
only change if you the customers here

913
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,990
push them to so please get angry start

914
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,240
pushing and start saying I want security

915
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,980
here I want security by default and I

916
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,580
want these things in so thank you

917
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,040
everybody I'm here for today and I think

918
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,930
I'm around a little bit tomorrow I'm on

919
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,480
Quentin blog on Twitter I talked about

920
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,210
not to print security but a lot bits

921
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,070
about security there and then that's my

922
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,390
corporate email at the bottom and I'm

923
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,820
happy to answer any questions I'm apt to

924
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,290
answer any questions on Twitter or

925
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,510
corporate email and if you've got any

926
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,960
question about office IOT print security

927
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,299
management or anything else and I'll be

928
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:04,230
really honest with you I'm not a

929
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,000
salesperson might be quite evident by my

930
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,029
presentation style so I'm happy to

931
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,470
answer any questions now or happy and

932
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,330
answer any questions later on thank you

933
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:12,720
everybody

934
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,820
oh we ever we have one question just

935
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:24,240
down here our office IOT manufactures

936
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,860
and Printers are they getting into bug

937
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,000
bounties so it's gonna be are they're

938
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,380
gonna be like bug bounties for printers

939
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,200
that something's been looked at some of

940
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,929
them are yes okay so we've been talking

941
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,870
about it under the under the hood it's

942
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,630
getting there it's not there

943
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,309
consistently at this moment in time

944
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:44,460
across all different areas which is a

945
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,899
bit of a shame actually I think it's

946
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,520
more than the consumer stuff it's it's

947
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,860
quite popular on the office IOT it's not

948
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,200
there yet it was a bit of a shame I

949
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,679
wanted to ask

950
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,070
so did you mention that if there is

951
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,750
something being printed and they don't

952
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,520
pick it up it it's being discarded or

953
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,960
because that's just something there

954
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,719
might be a good future so like what do

955
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,010
you have on an ATM if the money gets

956
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,020
sort of distributed and someone doesn't

957
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,089
pick it out it goes back which I'm just

958
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,520
saying something that will make my work

959
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,668
harder but it might be maybe good future

960
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:27,480
so I also have asked the same question

961
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,239
and the the what we've realized is if

962
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,770
you implement follow me printing so you

963
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,960
force the users to log on and only when

964
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,869
they log on does the print job come out

965
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:39,060
it kind of resolves the problem enough

966
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,500
so that you don't need to implement the

967
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,449
shredder underneath and you don't need

968
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,859
to do follow me printing with actually

969
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,929
logging on with an ID card you can do it

970
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,550
logging on with Active Directory you can

971
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,918
do logging on with biometrics and you

972
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,389
can log on with your face so as you

973
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,649
approach the printer it just suddenly

974
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:54,449
logs on as you there's all these

975
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,830
different options so there's so many

976
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,290
options of how to log on that I agree

977
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,010
but by implementing that other control

978
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,210
which gives you a whole load of other

979
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,800
benefits you don't need to implement the

980
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,240
relatively expensive control of a

981
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,970
built-in shredder although it would be a

982
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:13,399
really cool thing to build Thanks

983
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,720
okay thank you everybody and I think I'm
