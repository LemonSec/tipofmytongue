1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,640
next

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,879
is car security diary our connected

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,800
vehicle journey with elena time

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,759
edmund lim and tanpei from the division

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,920
zero car security quarter

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,200
following up from their previous

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,880
presentation on building a prototype

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,279
automated automotive security test bench

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,119
they'll talk about connected vehicle

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,720
technology and protocols beyond the

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
canvas

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,039
hi everyone my name is elena and today

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,880
together with my teammates

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,279
emma and peace will be talking about the

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,760
cast grady diaries our connected vehicle

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,559
journey

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,680
so unfortunately pacer's webcam is 40 so

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
later you will hear her voice and this

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
is pc

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
all right okay cool okay

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,840
so um i'll be talking about the journey

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,120
of branch 2

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
and emma will be talking about the

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
building challenges

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,520
getting into the infotainment system and

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,920
uh

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,199
pastry will be talking about the

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960
features versus vulnerabilities and the

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,240
summary of our learnings

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,119
okay so um basically you can't see our

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,840
faces here

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,439
anymore because you will cover a part of

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,000
the slide but uh here's a picture happy

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
picture of us and together with xavier

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,799
which is the tallest guy over here okay

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,439
so uh

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,479
again my name is alina and pacer is over

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,520
here

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,799
as you can see from my mouse and

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,680
everyone's over here and together uh

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
we are representing the task ready

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,720
quarter

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,840
so uh csq has a total of about 20 plus

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,400
members

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
and we are part of a wider same security

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
community here in singapore called

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,439
division zero

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,240
csq also powers the automotive security

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
research group

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,600
here in singapore called the asrg syn

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,799
chapter

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,720
automotive security business group is

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,079
based in stuttgart germany

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,200
and the goals of the car security quota

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
is to

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
basically facilitate and promote

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,000
automotive subsecurity awareness to the

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
community here in singapore uh we want

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
to actually empower like-minded security

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,079
enthusiasts in gaining hands-on

61
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,600
experiences

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
so over here in the picture as you can

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
see we have about 10 of us

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,560
working on the the gila test bench which

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
is our test bench one

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and ultimately we want to use all these

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,239
features research to actually contribute

68
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
to the automotive security uh

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,640
in the industry through a community

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,360
engagement

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,120
and also the building of our test

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
benches

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,480
right so let's begin about the journey

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
of our bench tool

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,040
okay so previously from bench one we

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
actually mentioned that bench two will

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
feature a connected vehicle

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,599
uh sort of test bench so over here i

79
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,519
brought up our previous world map

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,920
uh as you can see that uh we were

81
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
actually planning for prototype 2 at a

82
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,640
point of time

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,239
which will actually feature collective

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,160
vehicles functionality

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,440
which will be categorized under the sae

86
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
levels 1 and 2.

87
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
so basically the sae level 1 and 2 is

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,239
sort of like partial driver assistance

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:06,879
systems

90
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,000
such as adas so over here you can see it

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,640
has means

92
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,200
advanced driver assistance systems uh

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
where you also have your adaptive cruise

94
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,080
control and stuff

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,200
so we wanted to work towards more of a

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
connected vehicle uh sort of environment

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
to get the group

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,280
going and then ultimately we want to

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
move towards automotive vehicles

100
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
so over here as you can see from the

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
left picture we have our csq bench one

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,840
whereby it's just a few components for

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,599
different components of the vehicle in

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,159
fact

105
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,720
and for the csq bench tool we actually

106
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,159
have much more components

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
even though you just see that you know

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,599
there's only the infotainment system and

109
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,720
cluster meter

110
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,200
uh over here at the top but we actually

111
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
have much more components

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
at the lower layers of the badge itself

113
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,879
which i'll go through a little bit more

114
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
later

115
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,959
okay so the inspiration of our uh bench

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,439
tool

117
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
is that we were actually inspired by

118
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,959
kindlep's uh

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,080
cbe findings announced in blackhead us

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,879
in 2019 since there was already a known

121
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,720
finding we wanted to actually utilize

122
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,639
that to allow us to understand different

123
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
vehicle protocols and infotainment

124
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,440
systems

125
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,960
so as opposed to our previous bench one

126
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
there isn't any infotainment system over

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
there because the vehicle is too old

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,080
so this environment itself will actually

129
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
help us to understand more vehicular

130
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,199
protocols

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,880
so um the infotainment system is

132
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,400
actually vastly different compared to

133
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
the traditional can bus

134
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
as they are actually different protocols

135
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,759
present such as

136
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,880
mohs and ethernet so most means

137
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
media omitted systems transport protocol

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,479
which uh we'll touch a bit more later

139
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,880
and uh over here one unique component

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
that we have that we will see in the

141
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,120
benchmark

142
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
is the central gateway module so the

143
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,199
central gateway has many other different

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
protocols such as the flex ray

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
flex-ray bars which is the high-speed

146
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
critical bus used in more high-end

147
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
vehicle models

148
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,960
and the lane bus which is local

149
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
interconnect network

150
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
and uh various different sorts of can

151
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,080
bars over here you have the powertrain

152
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,479
can

153
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,960
pt can kcan and chassis cam which i'll

154
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
talk a bit more later

155
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
okay so for the vehicular protocol

156
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,479
introductions uh

157
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
like i mentioned earlier there are

158
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,759
actually different protocols within the

159
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,360
central gateway module

160
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,199
uh there are also different variations

161
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,639
of can bus that controls different

162
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,320
functions within the vehicle

163
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,720
so first up the central gateway module

164
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
actually filters out some of the

165
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,280
messages

166
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,000
that's going through the vehicle system

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,479
so it

168
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,240
acts as a firewall component to say

169
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
so uh as for the pt cam bus the

170
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,320
powertrain can

171
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,880
it actually controls different units and

172
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,440
modules

173
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
associated with the power tree so

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,479
powertrain like your

175
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,319
uh critical system such as your um

176
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,120
your brakes your transmission or your

177
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,000
gearbox

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,639
systems are considered as powertrain and

179
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,199
as well

180
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,440
as your chassis scan chassis can

181
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,319
features

182
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,800
the controls over modules sensors and

183
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
actuators for example your power

184
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,280
steering

185
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
and for k can similar to other cambuses

186
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
is actually a two wire body bus that

187
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,080
controls

188
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
our modules sensors and actuators

189
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,240
so over here we have a diagram which is

190
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,560
not

191
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,000
similar to our vehicular

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
architecture but it gives a good

193
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,400
breakdown on how

194
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,759
the different campuses are actually

195
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,919
connected to the central gateway module

196
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,639
as you can see over here the central

197
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,319
gateway module is actually connected to

198
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,440
the cluster meter

199
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
as well as the obd2 diagnostic can and

200
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
in that you have your body can bus which

201
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,639
is con connected to your

202
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
driver door ecu keyless entry so on and

203
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,560
so forth

204
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,080
and then your chassis scan your

205
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,000
all-wheel drive system power steering

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
module

207
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,319
and then your powertrain can your

208
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,639
transmission systems your heat lamps

209
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,199
and comfort can which is not present in

210
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:05,840
this

211
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
particular vehicular model that we're

212
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,240
working on is for the hvac

213
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
and then the camera ecu so um all of

214
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,199
these are actually connected to the

215
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,599
infotainment system over here as well

216
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,560
but this is just

217
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,319
a sample diagram it's not

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,199
but it shows a good breakdown on how the

219
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,759
canvas

220
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
should actually work in a regular

221
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,599
vehicle

222
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,120
okay so the journey of bench2 on how we

223
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
actually boot that bench is

224
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
uh we actually have a pretty tight

225
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
budget because csqr is actually

226
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,759
non-profit

227
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,080
so in order to actually understand these

228
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,160
protocols we actually have to build

229
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,720
the test branch through like choosing

230
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,000
critical components

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
to build upon so one of the major

232
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
components that we need to purchase in

233
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
this case is the central gateway module

234
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,319
the infotainment unit and the telematics

235
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,080
we also added a few more items

236
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,960
such as the cluster meter and the dde so

237
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,319
the dde is a diesel

238
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
digital electronics module uh that is

239
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,479
facilitating the initial module of this

240
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,599
vehicle

241
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
so uh there are actually three different

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
layers to simulate the previous

243
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
architecture with some

244
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,240
additional components so layer one we

245
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
have like our

246
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,599
infotainment unit our central gateway

247
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,440
module or dde

248
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,000
layer two we have our custom meter

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,199
telematics module

250
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,000
and finally layer 3 we have the screens

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,879
and

252
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,279
everything wired up so what you don't

253
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,640
really see over here

254
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
is uh the wirings they are actually

255
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,159
carefully hidden

256
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,519
beneath the vehicular test bench itself

257
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,480
and then uh we also have our central

258
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,839
control module

259
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,920
over here that actually navigates to

260
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
different controls of the

261
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,720
vehicle itself yeah so uh moving on uh

262
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
and then we'll actually speak a little

263
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
bit more about our different building

264
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,120
challenges and

265
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,240
how we actually overcome them thank you

266
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,040
elena

267
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,839
so i'll be talking about some of the

268
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
challenges

269
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,680
okay because you are getting your second

270
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,080
hand

271
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,399
from various places you have to research

272
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
into which parts work for the model

273
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,959
that we are going to zoning and build so

274
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,160
actually a big chunk of

275
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,480
time was then looking for the ranging

276
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,440
diagrams

277
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,519
and making sure the parts cells will fit

278
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,360
and are able to communicate with each

279
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,640
other

280
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,720
so when a pass arrives we wired up

281
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
everything then proceeded to

282
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
power out the bench however we noticed

283
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
that the cluster in people payment

284
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,680
system

285
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,800
does not have any display shown

286
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
so we went back to research and realized

287
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
that we're actually waiting for

288
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
a pickup signal from the caster's

289
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
control module before they will start up

290
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
we have to simulate this signal and

291
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,760
after sending the cam message into the

292
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,640
bus

293
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,839
the bench finally powered up

294
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,079
the left picture the turn down shows the

295
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,560
current signal that we are confident

296
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,079
and same with the vehicles 5 you can see

297
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:19,839
the hs can 130 on the canvas

298
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,519
is another problem so as soon as we

299
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,120
power up the bench

300
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
we notice that there are no other

301
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
signals present on

302
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,240
so this tells us that the obd2 port has

303
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,959
actually been

304
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
hardened and we had to perform a man in

305
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,320
the middle to read

306
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,360
or inject 10 messages into the level

307
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,600
from the wiring diagram we then located

308
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
the points you want to leave and inject

309
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
the canvas form

310
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
and as expected we got clear message

311
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,079
activity coming from both the

312
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,040
infotainment unit

313
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
and the instrument cluster as shown in

314
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
the waterline feature

315
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
after much experimentation we learned

316
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,240
that the central gateway is filtering

317
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
out messages to and from the obesity

318
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,720
part

319
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560
that only allow the wake up signal to be

320
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
captured

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,839
performing men in the middle beginners

322
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,680
says to inject whatever messages

323
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,839
he wants into the test bench and we got

324
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,000
some interesting results to show

325
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,399
for example the animal collision

326
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,320
detection and human pollution is

327
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
actually displayed on the initial

328
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
cluster shown in the pictures

329
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
below

330
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,399
on the left shows spoofing or

331
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,640
speedometer in the vehicle

332
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
where we can clear the speedometer to

333
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,079
the maximum speed

334
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
and on the right video we can actually

335
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
make the cluster flicker and go

336
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,839
crazy with the leds

337
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
document it was mentioned lately that

338
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,800
the entertainment system

339
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,160
can be assigned to an ip address of

340
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,920
192.168.01

341
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,120
however we never explicitly mentioned

342
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,600
how

343
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,600
this can be done so we realize that

344
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,399
actually an internal dhcp server has to

345
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,279
be set

346
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,959
to provide an ip address to the

347
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,600
infotainment system

348
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
in this screenshot you can see that

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,240
after setting up a dhcp server

350
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
the mac address of the entertainment is

351
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,279
reflected

352
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,240
on the interface with an assigned ip of

353
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,800
192.168.0.5.1

354
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,839
this allows us to do an initial scan

355
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,399
system

356
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,399
using hand maps you can see

357
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,680
that there were several open ports like

358
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
port 6801 and 6811

359
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,760
which is used for the 4bd2 to access for

360
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
the central degree module

361
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
we are also able to look into the http

362
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,720
report

363
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,519
as seen on the right screenshot at this

364
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,800
point we need more time

365
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,120
to research into what we can do with the

366
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,880
cost service we have discovered

367
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,040
and

368
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,240
after connecting the most capable to

369
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,120
additional customer

370
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,420
[Music]

371
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,160
so shown in the right screenshot you can

372
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,959
see

373
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,880
several sensors such as abs

374
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,480
a red brake telltale check engine light

375
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,399
and seat belt is on as compared to the

376
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,680
left when the most

377
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,560
cable is not connected so next

378
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,240
i'll pass on the rest of the

379
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
presentation to facebook

380
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,320
to talk about features versus from

381
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,800
youtube

382
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,639
thank you nina edmund hi i'm pacer and

383
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,199
i'll be presenting from here on so let's

384
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,639
talk about features versus

385
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,399
vulnerabilities

386
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,320
from the very beginning when we started

387
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,079
on our research

388
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,120
we always looked at potential attack

389
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
vectors you know

390
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
potential areas of intrusion

391
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
the deeper into the research we went the

392
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,360
more we start thinking about

393
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,680
hey how could this potentially impact

394
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,959
the users right

395
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,519
because from our standpoint we know

396
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,000
we're just

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,360
thankfully security researchers

398
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
we just wanted to test out the features

399
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
of the vehicles

400
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,040
in a safe and controlled environment but

401
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
when you put it into the context of

402
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,000
regular users like you know

403
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,120
just drivers on the road

404
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
this very same set of features that

405
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,639
you're testing

406
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,240
this could potentially turn into a

407
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,399
double-edged sword and place left in

408
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,199
danger when

409
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,839
they're repurposed for a malicious

410
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,399
intent

411
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,120
so one great example of this actually is

412
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,600
the series of text targeting a 2014

413
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
jeep cherokee if you haven't already do

414
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
check it out

415
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
essentially what happened was that two

416
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,279
automotive researchers

417
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,440
were in control of the jeep remotely and

418
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,959
they were able to do a variety of

419
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,920
attacks

420
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,639
such as killing the engine or disabling

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,680
the brakes

422
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,079
if you think about it you know this if

423
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,839
you look at the research itself these

424
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,600
were all made possible due to

425
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
vulnerabilities in the infotainment

426
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,720
system

427
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,600
and the features that they went after

428
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,880
and this is the very same set of

429
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,639
features that we use when we drive

430
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,000
so there wasn't anything special about

431
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
the features that they went after rather

432
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,839
it was something that

433
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,880
we were all using yeah

434
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
so this is actually what we kept in mind

435
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,120
from the very beginning until now so let

436
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,320
me go through the summary of our

437
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
learnings from bench2

438
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,680
okay so our very first learning is

439
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
actually that can wake up signal

440
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,079
is needed for the infotainment system

441
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,920
this wasn't actually really stated in

442
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
like any documentation

443
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,720
we had to probe around quite a bit to

444
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,040
find out about this our first band

445
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,000
shouldn't have this

446
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,639
um they don't have this like we didn't

447
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,759
encounter this issue

448
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,839
so when we actually did

449
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,440
um encounter this issue we're actually

450
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,199
pretty worried that

451
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,480
we got a piece of junk we accidentally

452
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,560
paid for a piece of junk and we

453
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,160
weren't getting our money's worth but

454
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,639
like essentially

455
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,320
um but we did see that

456
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,920
uh it was being powered on

457
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,800
like we kind of saw the initially we

458
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,199
didn't

459
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,160
even see the voltage stabilizing it was

460
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
constantly fluctuating which was a big

461
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,199
problem

462
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
and eventually after poking around

463
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,720
online a bit we

464
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,760
got more parts and we also saw that

465
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,480
we actually needed a can wake up signal

466
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,039
and and that essentially

467
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,160
was our very first step right so

468
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,400
that was like one part down um it was a

469
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,919
huge relief when we all saw it happen

470
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,319
because

471
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,359
we finally saw the screen turn on and

472
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,720
now we know that we didn't actually get

473
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
a piece of junk

474
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,400
so yeah so

475
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,679
for our second learning and challenges

476
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,880
we learned that the central gateway

477
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,440
module

478
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,640
was able to filter out can messages and

479
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,840
prevent connectivity to the infotainment

480
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,080
system

481
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
thanks to that so

482
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,120
we found this out because we wanted to

483
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
be able to access the infotainment

484
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,760
system

485
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,240
via the usb port the physical usb port

486
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,720
on the car itself and

487
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,919
you pretty much think that when you plug

488
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
something in you know it's plug and play

489
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,640
you'll be able to work directly right

490
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,120
no we're pretty much mistaken about that

491
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,480
so

492
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,000
we had to cycle through five to six

493
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,679
different usb to ethernet adapters

494
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,880
and my god that was a huge pain

495
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,360
like we went through so much just so

496
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
that

497
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,520
um turns out only

498
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,880
a very specific chipset

499
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,720
was would cause the infotainment system

500
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
to respond to it

501
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,840
and give us

502
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,919
the desired output that we're looking

503
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,200
for

504
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360
and even then after we got the the

505
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,880
adapter right we

506
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,120
had we still had quite a bit of like

507
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,039
manual configuration to do

508
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,039
like setting up a dhcp server

509
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,520
assigning the ip address manually and he

510
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
had to be

511
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,799
uh pretty specific so that's when it's

512
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,280
192.1.168.0.1

513
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,840
and a bit like a couple of other

514
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,919
configurations later

515
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,120
here we are and that's what you see

516
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,600
from uh the screenshot itself

517
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,160
and at the same time um if you did an

518
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
end map scan

519
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,120
uh if you did an aggressive

520
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,280
scan right oh we sat there for so long

521
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,360
uh i don't suggest you do that on a

522
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,039
regular basis

523
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,320
it's a huge uh it's the most time

524
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,919
consuming thing ever

525
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,440
please don't ever do this if you're

526
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,960
doing like a record

527
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,240
on corn normally is really noisy

528
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
yeah we did it we did it for this for

529
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,600
this particular uh

530
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,720
car and we saw that port 80 was suffered

531
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,360
and port 6801 was open

532
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,120
so yeah there was a summary of what we

533
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,799
learned from bench 2

534
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,000
was that the most protocol allows some

535
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
sensor signals to be transmitted to

536
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
cluster meter

537
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,720
a can wake up signal is required for the

538
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,039
infotainment system

539
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,840
without it you're most probably going to

540
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,559
end up like us

541
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,280
questioning like what have i done wrong

542
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,919
and

543
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
have i been scammed you know did i buy a

544
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,000
piece

545
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,679
of metal oh plastic

546
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,480
so yeah you most probably did not buy

547
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,159
you you know you most probably do not

548
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,520
get scammed

549
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,880
but you mostly just need a wake-up

550
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,520
signal and lastly the central gateway

551
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,000
module fills us out canned messages and

552
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,280
prevents connectivity

553
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,320
to the infotainment web server itself

554
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
feel free to approach us or talk to us

555
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,840
open discord server if you have any

556
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,400
queries or if you want to listen to

557
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,120
us talk about how much pain we went

558
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
through just for this

559
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,640
my god we uh

560
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,919
we are so uh not triggered but like

561
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,840
we're quite traumatized from this

562
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,039
anti it was fun it was fun

563
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,080
but when i go through the experience

564
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,640
of looking through five to six

565
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,760
uh usb to internet adapters and

566
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,440
scrolling through mindlessly on

567
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,840
so many car hacking forums or

568
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,480
um yeah mostly a lot of forums

569
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,600
i would do it again but that was a huge

570
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
pain though

571
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,960
especially at like 1 2 a.m where

572
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
alina will be sending us like so many

573
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,039
articles or

574
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,240
um links to some weird website where we

575
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
had to translate it because it wasn't in

576
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,760
english

577
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,360
and yeah that's

578
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,159
that's like a whole new world by itself

579
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,679
csql has always been

580
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,640
and will always be a continuous effort

581
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,280
and

582
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,440
our main goal has always been to

583
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,159
understand vehicle architectures better

584
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,360
in order to do so we must be able to

585
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
build more benches so that we are able

586
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
to experiment with them hands-on and we

587
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,159
are able to learn better that way also

588
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,120
and at the same time we are also we are

589
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,080
also going to

590
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,799
continue our research with our two

591
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,200
existing ventures

592
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,799
because we have already i don't think

593
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,960
we've actually fully utilized them

594
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,320
you know you might actually find some

595
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,960
we've actually find something that

596
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,120
we never we never knew might have

597
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,000
existed right

598
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,559
so it's always a continuous effort in

599
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,159
that sense

600
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,559
and these tests they are conducting you

601
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,200
know

602
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,520
they range from remote attacks to key

603
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,000
fault infotainment ecu testing and side

604
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
channel attacks

605
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,159
so there's no limits we are still going

606
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,280
to go on

607
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
um doing what we're doing and yeah we're

608
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
gonna see how far we can take it

609
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
and eventually you want to be able to

610
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,080
progress towards autonomous vehicles or

611
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,120
so

612
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,640
uh that's our eventual goal since uh av

613
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,159
is actually a really big thing and

614
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,600
it'll be a really really fun year for us

615
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
to explore so

616
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,559
if there's anyone who's willing to

617
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,919
sponsor us do drop us an email

618
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,679
so we've actually come to the end of our

619
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,840
presentation we hope you've enjoyed

620
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,159
whatever we've presented about just now

621
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
and we hope that you actually learn

622
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,279
something at the same time

623
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,440
if you have any questions feel free to

624
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
ask us over in the discord server

625
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,799
we are cast security quarter kang and

626
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,880
a huge shout out and thank you to emil

627
