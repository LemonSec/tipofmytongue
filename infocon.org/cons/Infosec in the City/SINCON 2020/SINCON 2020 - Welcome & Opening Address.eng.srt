8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,480
things

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,720

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,718
discord

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,920
other founder ismail he knows too many

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
people

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,160
you might know him because of this

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,640
division zero thing it's just a small

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,440
event in singapore

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
the common link we have is that of royal

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
holloway

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
we both went there

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,559
we talked before 2018 about

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,000
running an event and in 2018 it became a

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
real thing and we started

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,799
infosec in the city in that year

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,840
we did a second event in 2019 which was

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
huge

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,400
and we were really hoping for something

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,520
different this year

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,320
we had all sorts of amazing plans

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,320
first we decided that we'd be better off

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,520
known as cincon

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,560
because we are an event in singapore and

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
infosec in the city had plans to expand

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
around the world

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,680
we were hoping to give you views of this

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
magical place

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
sadly that's not to be

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
and that's due to something you're all

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,200
very aware of covert

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,720
19 and we must give our thanks to

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,159
all the healthcare workers around the

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,920
world and

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
to all the vaccine scientists who

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
scientists who've been working

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
many many hours to bring a solution to

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,840
this issue

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
to reality

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,878
so simcon the first edition

51
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,080
is actually virtual

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
we know it's 2021 but we're still

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
calling it the 20th 20th edition

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,599
ask him why

55
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,200
and we're doing things a little bit

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
different

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
we tried virtualizing the conference

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
hall all of last year

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
with various events but we found that

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
actually having a common shared discord

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,760
experience

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
was better for engagement so we're doing

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,959
that

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,879
we've also had a very organized flow as

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
to how

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,879
you actually engage with the event so

67
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,599
you're here

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,640
you've got a ticket well done are you on

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,599
discord

70

many of you are but if you're not please

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
get on it now

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
because the third thing we need you to

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,720
do is engage

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840

75

because there you'll find all of the

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
channels dedicated to each

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,239
of the talks you're going to see where

78
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:16,720
you can

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,440
speak and communicate with the speaker

80

conferences that we've seen in singapore

296
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639

297
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
sponsoring conferences or any trade

298
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,440

299
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,560
and for singcon we tell all sponsors no

300
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,360

302
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,639
contact

um by giving us money

304
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,079
it's it's an easy way for us to get

305
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,120
money from them

306
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,920
but we know that is that was spoiled for

307
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,120
people's experience

308
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
by getting lots of spams so we always

309
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,519
tell sponsors no they will not get

310
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,040
um your contact um

311
