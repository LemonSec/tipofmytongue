practitioners cyber defenders

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,000
continuously learn from each other to

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,320
curb advanced threats

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,279
now our next keynote speaker is another

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,720
super heavyweight champion

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,279
in the cybersecurity space let us warmly

um i've got a a bit of a of a

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
of a broad topic to cover here around

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,359
just a set of uh

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,040
things that i'm observing in the in the

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
industry and uh how i hope

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,840
hackers can contribute to a little bit

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,479
of a

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,680
of a better outlook for 2021 than

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,640
than we had in in 2020 uh i'd like to

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,119
think

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,799
a little bit on the optimistic side that

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,400
we're turning a corner here and

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,360
uh the things things can look up for the

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,080
better

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
even if it doesn't feel like that day to

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,320
day i find it always

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,119
like i'm a hopeless optimist on the on

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,000
that front

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,320
um so before we start diving and talking

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,200
about hackers

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,840
um my name is alex rice i'm the cto and

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
founder of a company called

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,119
hackerone we're we're honored to be a

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,840
community

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
of hackers or security researchers

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,079
pen testers from from all over the world

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,840
that contribute to making software

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,000
safer and technology more more

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,280
trustworthy

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,479
um i wanted to to share a bit of a story

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,280
of um that i think does a good job of

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,479
highlighting

58
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,759
some of the headwinds that

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,038
hackers in general have had in in making

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,440
those positive contributions to the

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
to to the world so it's going to start

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,000
us off with

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,440
a uh one of my favorite hackers on the

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,000
planet if

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
folks don't recognize him this is uh

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
this is sami kamkar

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,959
from uh from a number number of years

68
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
ago um that has stayed

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,640
stayed active in the security community

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
made some very very

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
meaningful contributions to our

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,879
collective security from

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,200
um um technology stacks across the board

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,040
from from web security to

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,599
home security to vulnerabilities in in

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,599
our garage door openers where

77
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
and privacy uh techniques with

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,160
with uh to make uh so that uh websites

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
have a harder time

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,239
uh tracking us with with cookies and the

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:58,800
like

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,959
we are all unquestionably safer because

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,400
of uh because of sammy but i wanted to

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,720
rewind a little bit to uh

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,080
around uh 2006 2007 where uh

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,040
sammy first uh uh introduced himself to

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,680
uh to

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
to the world um

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,400
back then uh sammy decided

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
to uh uh do a bit of a prank

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
on on on myspace the predominant

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
leading social network of of the time um

93
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,319
you found a crosstalk scripting

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,200
vulnerability in in the site and uh

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,680
not being an evil person decided to do a

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,319
bit of a

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,400
bit of a prank on uh on it so he uh

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,680
weaponized the the uh the vulnerability

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,480
to

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,200
uh cause anyone who is was impacted by

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
this vulnerability to become friends

102
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,400
with sami and that immediately post

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,120
most of all sammy is is my hero so he he

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,319
codes this up he

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,879
sends it to one of his friends and uh

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
goes to bed he wakes up the next morning

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
to see that it's working he's got uh 200

108
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,239
221

109
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,959
friend requests on on myspace and he's

110
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
feeling great about

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
all his newfound friends grab some

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,400
breakfast and

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
an hour later has a 480 friend request

114
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
now uh getting getting getting quite

115
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,600
popular um

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
and that's the moment when he realizes

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,199
like uh

118
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,199
uh oh this is uh this growth here is

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
looking more exponential than uh

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,479
uh than linear so fast forward 18 hours

121
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,520
by end of the day

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,320
sammy became the most popular on a

123
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,800
person on social networking of

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,479
of all time at that point with over over

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,639
a million million friend requests

126
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,360
uh and about an hour later uh myspace

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,000
goes down

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
they uh they take the take the site

129
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
offline to uh

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
it wasn't handling it and you just

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,639
needed to solve the problem

132
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,199
um sammy reflects on this now pretty

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,240
apologetically

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,520
of um um feeling very very bad about

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,840
this

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
about his prank turning out into uh uh

137
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
into this um he didn't hear anything

138
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
from myspace for

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
for a while um didn't go through any

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,000
steps to

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
to hide himself like he was his real

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
profile he was based in los angeles just

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
a few miles away from from my space

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
headquarters but didn't didn't hear from

145
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,039
them for a bit

146
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,759
until uh it was a six or nine months

147
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,160
later

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,320
or so uh the fbi pays pays sami a visit

149
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,280
um samli ultimately ended up getting uh

150
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,039
about three years of probation

151
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,170
from any computer usage and

152
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,840
[Music]

153
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,080
uh had to do quite a bit of community

154
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
service as a restitution

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,680
and i think that's a little bit uh maybe

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
it may be a

157
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
justice in some definitions but a little

158
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,479
bit disappointing outcome because sami

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,720
is absolutely capable of making

160
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,960
more positive contributions to society

161
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,319
um as he has

162
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
since then he's gone on to contribute to

163
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,000
security research as we as we talked

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
about

165
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,240
but at the exact same time there was a

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,800
uh

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,520
another social network uh just getting

168
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,400
started

169
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
um it also had cross-site scripting

170
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
vulnerabilities in it

171
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,440
back at the back at the time um and

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
another

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,639
pair of young hackers found a crosstalk

174
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,919
sweeping vulnerability and also did a

175
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,720
prank

176
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
um this prank though replaced all of the

177
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
css on the site

178
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,120
so that uh all your facebook profile if

179
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
you got infected with this would look

180
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,240
like a myspace page

181
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,560
instead of a a facebook profile and they

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,639
called it they called it face space

183
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
so everyone on they got infected with

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,479
this thing slowly turned uh

185
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,160
uh the site into uh into into face space

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
but uh instead of the fbi come either

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,919
way one of the founders

188
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,600
and the head of engineering and facebook

189
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,280
at the time uh

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,520
found out uh that attribution on who is

191
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
responsible for this

192
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,319
uh sends uh an a message to uh

193
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,160
the uh the individual responsible uh

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,599
chris chris bunnum

195
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,560
and uh a very different tack though and

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
that ended up hiring

197
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,280
him onto the engineering team to uh

198
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,240
uh protect against uh uh categories like

199
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,639
this

200
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
and uh be one of the initial initial

201
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
security hires to the

202
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,759
uh to to the organization and that

203
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,120
that path ultimately helped

204
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
facebook develop a much stronger

205
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,520
security culture than myspace was ever

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
able to

207
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
uh uh introduce um but it's also a much

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
more productive outlet for those skills

209
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
and that creativity

210
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,440
and it kind of uh it's something i

211
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
reflect on a lot around

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
how should we treat people with skills

213
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,759
like this how do we guide this towards

214
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,639
uh more positive outcomes and i think

215
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:44,960
we've

216
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,680
turned a corner where there's a broad

217
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,560
consensus

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
that companies need hackers they should

219
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,240
be

220
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
hired by companies rather than um

221
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,400
uh prosecuted and uh and punished

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,479
that's kind of the basis of where we're

223
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,000
at in in hacker one

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,919
today there's about uh 2000

225
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,680
organizations on the platform

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,639
that invite hackers to participate in a

227
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,960
ethical productive manner

228
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,440
and those hackers have resolved over 200

229
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
000 vulnerabilities

230
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,879
and uh very pleased to say that we've

231
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,199
made them 125 million dollars richer

232
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,479
which is just

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,479
which is just a fantastic contribution

234
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,160
both to them but also to our

235
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,680
all of our all of our digital safety

236
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
so one of the first themes i was going

237
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,159
to cover here

238
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
is the is the concept of just

239
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,799
who are these hackers what

240
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,560
good can they provide to society and

241
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,200
what um how do we all be how do we all

242
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
benefit from this

243
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
we really think about hacker as a very

244
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,000
broad

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,720
definition originally defined back at

246
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,519
mit

247
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
in the 70s in their hacker jargon file

248
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,440
they defined it

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,160
as someone who enjoys the intellectual

250
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,279
challenge of

251
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
finding creative ways around limitations

252
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
i think this

253
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,440
really nails the heart of what it means

254
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,160
to

255
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
to be a hacker it's about encountering

256
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,279
limitations

257
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,399
finding ways around it um no mention of

258
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,640
of good or evil right motives are kind

259
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
of secondary to just that creative

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
pursuit of

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,279
finding a way to do something that

262
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,480
wasn't that wasn't possible

263
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
we spent a lot of time trying to

264
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
understand

265
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,560
who hacks today why do they hack what do

266
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,640
they what do they look like

267
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
one of the most incredible strengths of

268
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,000
the community

269
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is the diversity of backgrounds and

270
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
perspectives

271
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,920
and takes on on on security so i wanted

272
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
to share a little bit about

273
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,600
of the of the hackers that we work with

274
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
uh in the hacker one community

275
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,080
who are they what what what do they do

276
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,279
where did they come from how do they get

277
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,720
into this and spend a little bit of time

278
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
talking about that

279
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,600
um vast majority of them are are um

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
in the 18 to 24 range or really 18 to

281
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,480
35 um and

282
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,640
it's not a long tenured

283
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,760
career most of the people entering the

284
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
industry today

285
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,399
or practicing uh hacking skills

286
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,640
on a regular basis surprisingly have not

287
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,839
been doing it for

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,880
for very long which is which is great to

289
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
see

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,920
um and also i hope speaks to

291
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
the the level of opportunity that that

292
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,440
exists for

293
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
for these skills it's something that you

294
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,360
can get

295
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
good at in reasonably short time

296
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
horizons when people really set their

297
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
mind to it and in practice

298
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,079
which is both good news and bad news

299
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,320
because the the inverse of this

300
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,959
is is true for criminals that are that

301
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,760
are learning

302
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,440
hack skills like the the folks that

303
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,000
we're up against it does not take

304
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
that long to become relatively competent

305
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,519
at breaching software security um

306
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,560
and we've we've seen the impact of this

307
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,600
on on the negative side the negative

308
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
effects of this on criminals that are

309
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,360
able to breach or

310
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,399
kids that are able to prank large social

311
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,360
networks

312
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,399
and what we haven't been good at is

313
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,680
converting this to positive opportunity

314
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,240
both professionally and and economic for

315
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
the for the folks that

316
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,880
that have these skill sets

317
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,120
i think it's really fascinating to spend

318
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,399
a little bit of time

319
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,160
understanding the motivations of people

320
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
that

321
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
decide to to do this type of work that

322
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,079
decide to

323
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
hone and practice these skills and

324
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,560
far and away the reason that we see

325
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
reflects back on that that early

326
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
definition of a hacker

327
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
that we say it's there for the challenge

328
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
it's that creative challenge of

329
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
accomplishing something that that

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
shouldn't be possible

331
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,240
but increasingly people are doing it to

332
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,519
make money this is uh

333
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,480
and as they should be this is a a

334
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,240
valuable skill set

335
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,920
and it should those skills should

336
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
improve your your life and and economic

337
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,839
opportunity is

338
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,920
is one of the most meaningful ways to do

339
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
that but

340
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
the list of motivations for other people

341
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
are just as diverse as the group of

342
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,200
people that

343
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
participate in this in this skill set

344
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,959
they're there to learn

345
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,560
they're there to share they're there to

346
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
have fun um

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,200
they're doing it for uh altruistic

348
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,320
reasons of

349
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
protecting and defending and doing good

350
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
in the world and helping others

351
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
and there's a little bit of of ego in it

352
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
as well like this is um

353
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,880
you you feel good when you know you've

354
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,240
uh you've done something meaningful

355
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
there

356
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,880
and then on the um on the

357
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
the next thing we wanted to spend a

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,639
little time understanding the origin of

359
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,600
of of how you get started in this and

360
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
similarly here there's a pretty diverse

361
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
story for how do people get started with

362
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,240
hacking

363
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
there's uh a lot of people the the

364
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,000
impetus

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,279
was seeing the impact of a breach

366
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,720
on in in the public um that

367
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
starts triggering that curiosity around

368
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
like how does this work how does this

369
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,200
happen

370
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
um some people have stumbled upon

371
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,040
vulnerabilities themselves

372
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,600
or engaged in in forums and chat rooms

373
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,959
or other hackers were already

374
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,800
sharing how they did it and they got

375
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
hooked from from that

376
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,800
uh that perspective um a lot of folks

377
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,360
got into it

378
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,959
from from gaming which is how how i got

379
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,480
into computer security was

380
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,160
was reverse engineering uh games that i

381
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,320
i wanted to have a bit of a an unfair

382
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,120
advantage on

383
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,839
back in the back in the back in the 90s

384
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,360
um didn't view it as a

385
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,160
a computer security career at the time

386
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,639
but the

387
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,399
the skill sets picked up there lend

388
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,560
themselves very well to

389
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,760
the uh the security industry as uh as a

390
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,639
whole

391
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,959
but secondly where there's a biggest

392
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,480
opportunity for starting people into

393
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,959
hacking

394
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,480
is in school very few

395
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
almost an astonishingly small number of

396
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,000
the security professionals

397
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,560
today learned their skills or got

398
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
started on this track

399
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,600
in a structured education

400
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,360
environment and i i think that's a

401
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,639
critical area that we need to figure out

402
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,440
how to move into to get

403
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,519
more people out there protecting us and

404
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,160
doing good here

405
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
hacking is in some cases a a full-time

406
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,399
job in some cases

407
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,959
it augments a full-time job but the vast

408
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,399
majority of people

409
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,600
who are contributing to this uh broader

410
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
vulnerability disclosure

411
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
practice aren't doing it as a full-time

412
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,000
activity um

413
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
it's something that they dabble in and

414
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,160
as we really dig into this we see

415
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
this is key to being effective at it the

416
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
best security

417
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
professionals don't necessarily

418
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,880
specialize in one particular area

419
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
um the how do we overcome some

420
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,959
limitation

421
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,079
is the ability to do that is

422
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,760
stronger the broader your base um and so

423
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
folks that are software engineers during

424
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
the during the day

425
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,519
but set aside a few hours a week to do

426
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,959
the opposite of that

427
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,760
are are are very effective at the type

428
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,720
of work that they

429
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,560
that they do not not true across the

430
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,160
board there's certainly elements

431
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
of of security where going very very

432
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,839
deep into an area

433
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,079
produces the the best outcome and you

434
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,519
see that reflected

435
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,720
in the um in the data here as well

436
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,040
um but this uh diversity of

437
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,600
how much time should you dedicate to it

438
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,120
is a promising trend we think

439
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,680
and and then finally overwhelmingly

440
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,800
folks that

441
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
have have this skill set have been able

442
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,079
to leverage it into

443
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,560
full-time employment at a particular

444
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
place and this this is ultimately where

445
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
we need to get to we can't just have

446
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
people on the outside

447
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
looking for vulnerabilities and breaking

448
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,639
things you have to be part of the

449
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,600
solution

450
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,120
and it's hard to be part of the solution

451
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,959
if you're not part of the part of the

452
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,160
the company that's all to be building

453
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,680
these things so we think it's it's

454
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,199
fantastic to see

455
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,639
people that develop and leverage these

456
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,959
skill sets start

457
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,680
joining companies to practice these

458
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
these skills uh these skills full time

459
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
there's a very a bit of a u.s centric

460
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,199
look on it

461
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
today but i i really wanted to

462
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,160
um hope folks take away the message here

463
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,560
that

464
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,440
we need hacking it's it is a a good

465
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,600
activity we cannot build secure software

466
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,240
without it

467
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,639
but we are not equipping the next

468
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,079
generation of

469
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,560
people to have bring the skill set to

470
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,199
the

471
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,639
uh to the world um the training

472
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,360
and on-the-job training is is inadequate

473
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
organizations aren't investing in

474
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,279
training

475
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,680
there is far too many unfilled cyber

476
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,640
security

477
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,039
jobs and the vast majority of computer

478
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,160
science programs

479
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,559
and college degrees in general don't

480
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,520
incorporate this

481
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,079
into their into their work and so we're

482
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,679
we're working on changing this and i'd

483
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,400
encourage

484
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,079
everyone listen if you have an

485
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,439
opportunity to

486
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
uh give back to the education system or

487
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,640
incorporate this into formal programs or

488
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,199
build these training programs it's it's

489
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,480
one of the

490
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,520
highest value activities we can do as as

491
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,039
security professionals

492
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,320
in uh in in 2021 and beyond

493
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
so changing changing track a little bit

494
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,840
from

495
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,400
uh from hacking to good i wanted to um

496
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,200
spend a little bit of time talking about

497
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,280
what should we prioritize

498
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,080
in the face of all the different things

499
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
we have to prioritize

500
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,120
in defending technology um

501
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,400
this is a incredibly difficult task and

502
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,799
just

503
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,520
finding the problems is just one part of

504
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:05,840
the

505
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,760
part of the solution and then once we

506
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
know about it

507
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,640
what do we do about it often becomes

508
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,720
overwhelming for

509
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,360
csos and cios and heads of engineering

510
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
or anyone responsible for

511
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
for building secure technology what you

512
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
do once you know you have a problem

513
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
is is is an overwhelming task

514
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,320
for many folks one of the most useful

515
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,520
things that i've found

516
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,720
for organizing these teams after talking

517
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,600
to

518
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,200
many of our customers at the circle with

519
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
these challenges is the ones that are

520
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,200
doing it the best

521
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,760
have kind of broken from a traditional

522
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
security perspective of

523
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,799
mitigating risks completely but instead

524
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,160
orient themselves around

525
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,840
speed and i think a a

526
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,280
talk from black hat last year by kelly

527
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,960
and nicole i i highly recommend

528
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,520
about uh going a little bit deeper into

529
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
how to think about

530
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,919
speed as it applies to security and that

531
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,440
i like the way that they they framed it

532
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,240
that i'll i'll summarize basically as

533
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,679
good security teams have the mindset

534
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
and the expectation that their security

535
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,520
controls are going to fail

536
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,000
and they plan for it it's not a question

537
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,640
of

538
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,120
will the security control fail every

539
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,559
control that you develop

540
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,720
is done with the pers with the mindset

541
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
of it is inevitable that this control

542
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,559
will fail

543
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,080
what then um and then

544
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,520
with that mindset you start to move

545
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,240
yourself away from you're not

546
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,039
your goal is not to avoid incidents your

547
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,720
your goal and your orientation is

548
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,440
to continuously improve your ability to

549
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,320
respond to those to those incidents

550
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,080
and then there's uh one key outcome from

551
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,880
this

552
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,640
which is if your int's

553
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,919
information security program is focused

554
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,160
on

555
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,039
avoiding failure whether you're tracking

556
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,799
the time between failure or the number

557
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,159
of incidents or you're

558
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,799
counting bad things that happened all of

559
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,360
those metrics will lead you astray

560
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,559
um and i encourage you to to to spend a

561
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,120
little time

562
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
thinking about what this means if you

563
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
were to reimagine

564
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,559
defending technology with the

565
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
expectation that

566
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,320
everything's going to fail we are not

567
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,600
going to avoid incidents

568
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
but we want to be as efficient as we can

569
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,720
about them and

570
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,120
counting bad things or counting failure

571
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,840
or focusing on failure is the wrong

572
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,639
orientation

573
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,080
similarly katie here in pursuit of

574
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,520
what metrics to track has

575
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
something that that i found very

576
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
effective in our own program

577
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,360
at hacker1 but for many of our customers

578
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,799
which is the

579
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,280
percent of vulnerabilities that you're

580
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,799
remediating within a

581
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,159
within an sla it's a very simplistic

582
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,320
metric but it's an incredibly powerful

583
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,159
one at assessing

584
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,080
are we getting better at um

585
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
responding to to vulnerabilities and

586
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,280
this is a this is a

587
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,520
an example from uh with a vulnerability

588
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
management and vulnerability disclosure

589
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,799
lens on it but this is a far

590
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,919
better metric than what you

591
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,400
traditionally see in those places

592
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,760
those spaces which are often based

593
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,720
around

594
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,120
quantity or completeness or risk scores

595
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,039
and if you kind of ignore all of that

596
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,480
for your program

597
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,840
and instead say our goal

598
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,679
is to be as fast as we can here

599
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,880
um and orient around

600
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,760
speed and learning is is a very very

601
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,480
powerful way to

602
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,679
approach this so we track this for all

603
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
of the programs that we

604
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,480
uh uh host on on hacker one

605
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,880
um we try to guide and consult customers

606
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,000
in this direction

607
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
around look time to resolve how quickly

608
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,919
are you remediating

609
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
is is one of the most important signals

610
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,400
of a maturity for your program and

611
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,000
and one of the best things that you can

612
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,640
do for for for risk so the the whole

613
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,840
part of the experience is oriented

614
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
around

615
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,159
getting things remediated faster what's

616
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:20,720
happening

617
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,840
you see there's a bit of a a bit of a

618
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,679
delta across industries in some cases

619
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,039
this is a lot harder

620
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,720
than others um right and for our

621
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,159
like spending 57 days to fix

622
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,039
uh and remediate issues in the aerospace

623
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:37,919
industry

624
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,039
is is actually pretty good this is

625
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,520
this is these are more uh surprisingly

626
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,480
mature

627
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,799
uh organizations in the in the data set

628
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,840
that we have here

629
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,480
um whereas folks like cryptocurrency

630
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,280
companies

631
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,480
like not spending too long

632
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,520
to resolve resolve uh in incidents

633
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,039
is uh is uh

634
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,840
a big problem for someone with where the

635
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,400
stakes are that fast for them

636
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
um so there's a spectrum here but the

637
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,000
median's actually not bad it was about

638
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,039
17 days

639
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,480
for for 2019 um but unfortunately we've

640
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,360
had a

641
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
while after several years of progress

642
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,640
there

643
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,480
um from uh going from about a month

644
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,919
in 2017 down to 17 days in 2019

645
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,600
uh we were on track with it within

646
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,039
approving but we've been seeing this

647
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,720
slowly creep up again

648
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
post uh post covid um we're up we're

649
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,200
back up to about 20 days again

650
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,280
being the the median time to remediate

651
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,600
across the the sample set that we have

652
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,120
which i think speaks a lot to the

653
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
challenges that we've had during

654
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,400
covenant to me was one of the more

655
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,559
worrying trends of cyber security we're

656
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,480
all trying to do more with less

657
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
we've got more folks working from home

658
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
we've got an expanded attack surface

659
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,039
like the the challenges that we've had

660
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,919
during

661
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,799
during covid have been have taken a toll

662
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,440
on

663
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,360
on every organization out there and it's

664
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,880
reflected in

665
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,080
in our ability to respond faster to

666
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,640
security problems i think we urgently

667
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,360
have to

668
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,440
start turning this trend in the other

669
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
direction we've got to adapt to this

670
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
new normal of working we've got to

671
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
figure out how to get

672
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
properly resourced properly staffed and

673
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,080
the business aligned around

674
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,360
speed being ultimately what uh what we

675
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,400
need to focus on

676
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,320
to uh to make meaningful progress and

677
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,760
protect our customers

678
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,039
so i i i hope we start pushing this in

679
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,240
the other direction again we're playing

680
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
a close eye on it i'd encourage anyone

681
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,600
who's in a defender

682
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
position to start making this one of the

683
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,520
most visible metrics that you have

684
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,039
for your for your executive staff and

685
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,120
your stakeholders

686
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,279
next i wanted to talk about

687
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,279
one of my favorite topics in insecurity

688
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,240
around transparency and my general

689
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,120
thinking on this

690
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
is related to what we just talked about

691
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,880
at the very beginning of

692
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,159
of the last section where uh

693
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,039
kelly and nicole so cleanly stated that

694
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,600
like

695
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,440
things are going to break stop trying to

696
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
vote and i think generally speaking

697
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,400
this is a healthy perspective to have in

698
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,320
information security bad things happen

699
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,559
and one of the most pertinent questions

700
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,760
for us is

701
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,120
how do we retain or rebuild

702
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
trust when they do if you're

703
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
in an area where trust is essential

704
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,919
which is almost all of our businesses

705
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,279
and we know that bad things are going to

706
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,200
happen on a regular basis

707
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
how do we continue to instill trust

708
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,360
in our customers and our constituents

709
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,000
and our

710
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,360
executives and our board that um

711
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,440
it's going to be okay even though these

712
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,360
bad things are are guaranteed to

713
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,240
to happen i have found that transparency

714
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,279
is one of the most

715
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,320
powerful tools and under

716
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,960
leverage tools that we have to to

717
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,320
address this and to build trust

718
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,600
i think one of the things that

719
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,679
illustrates this well and there's a lot

720
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,559
on this graph so

721
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,480
so bear with me for it for a second but

722
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,159
um what you're seeing

723
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,799
here is the causes of death in the

724
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:15,760
united states

725
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,080
these are these are very this is like

726
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
one of the worst things that can happen

727
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,400
people unquestionably a bad thing

728
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,520
happens every day

729
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,760
in the united states people die um

730
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
and this is a little bit stale

731
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
data i was i was reflecting on this when

732
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,919
i was putting into that i really want to

733
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,760
see an updated version of this that has

734
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,880
a coveted 19 on here as well because you

735
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,840
see uh

736
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,480
the pneumonia and the flu down there at

737
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
2.5 percent

738
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,440
but generally thinking the vast majority

739
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
of people are dying

740
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,640
for uh these reasons this is

741
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,520
still largely representative of what

742
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,720
death looks like

743
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,200
in in the united states it is not

744
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,159
dramatically

745
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,919
far off from most other developed

746
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,520
developed countries

747
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,480
however this is what people these are

748
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,240
the causes of death that people google

749
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,279
for

750
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,440
in the united states and far and away

751
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,240
the most probable way for you to die

752
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,320
in the united states is heart disease um

753
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,679
and almost nobody proactively searches

754
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,320
for

755
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,120
for information on it cancer's at least

756
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,679
somewhat

757
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,520
representative but then as you get down

758
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
the list you see people spending a lot

759
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
of time

760
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
researching things that are very low

761
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,440
probability of it happening to them

762
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,919
and then this is compounded a bit by

763
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,120
what does the media

764
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,000
report on what do you hear about like as

765
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,120
you as you open up

766
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,000
the news or your social networking feed

767
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
um

768
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
what's what's your perception from

769
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,080
there of what's going to kill you what's

770
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,440
the bad thing that's going to happen to

771
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:57,760
you

772
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,559
today and here there is this

773
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,240
disproportionate emphasis

774
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,399
on terrorism homicide suicide

775
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,840
which are very unlikely ways for you to

776
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
meet your demise

777
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,799
but take consume the

778
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,480
majority of what that's what we spend

779
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,520
the time worrying about or focusing on

780
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,039
and this pattern here

781
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,360
of humans not having a rational

782
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
understanding of

783
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,440
of risk and bad things happening plays

784
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,559
itself out

785
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,799
time time and time again across our

786
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
across a number of areas

787
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,200
including cyber security and uh in our

788
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,520
industry

789
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
i love this quote from uh nicholas

790
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,919
christoph at the um

791
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,960
new york times um i think captures it

792
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,679
well

793
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,880
um he says in journalism we cover

794
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,039
we don't we cover what has happened

795
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,120
today they're all over a press

796
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,640
conference or an explosion

797
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,000
but they don't cover the things that

798
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,679
happen every day

799
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,200
and they miss the stories about everyday

800
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,840
improvement and everyday progress

801
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,960
because things that happen every day are

802
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,880
never quite news

803
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,120
in this quote he's talking about

804
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
diarrhea

805
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,000
diarrhea is the leading cause of

806
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
death in children under five um

807
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,120
in in like the 30 minutes that i've been

808
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,480
talking

809
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,559
something like 40 kids have died from

810
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,760
diarrhea

811
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
in the world and when is the last time

812
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,880
you saw

813
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,159
a news article about diarrhea it's just

814
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:30,480
uh

815
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,320
it's not something we spend a lot of

816
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
time thinking about

817
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,240
um and

818
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,760
if you take this and you apply this

819
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,440
analogy to

820
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,320
to security what are the things that we

821
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
hear about all the time and we focus on

822
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,279
all the time

823
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,799
this week it's it's solar winds and

824
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
um the the breach of the week which is

825
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,080
probably worth us spending

826
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,039
spending time on um but i guarantee you

827
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,559
since solarwinds has

828
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,360
has broken there's been thousands of bad

829
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,159
things

830
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,919
happening at organizations that don't

831
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,440
have solar when deployed and are

832
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,120
probably not going to get

833
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,919
have a similar level attack against them

834
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,360
that are just getting ignored and not

835
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,039
getting our getting our attention

836
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,279
and we're not learning from and i find

837
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,799
this to be a really helpful

838
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,120
framing for what should we be worried

839
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,080
about today

840
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,279
and trying to take a balanced

841
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,679
perspective to what

842
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,799
what are the bad things that are going

843
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,520
to happen um and most importantly

844
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,039
how do we talk about them in a way

845
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,120
that shows this everyday improvement

846
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,320
this is uh uh an example of headlines

847
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,120
from uh

848
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,399
from breaches that um happened at

849
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,679
different organizations

850
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,320
that all have an identical root cause

851
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,240
at it and i'm sure as you read some of

852
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
these you start to start to form an

853
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,480
opinion about

854
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,640
about what it might have been um these

855
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
are all big companies

856
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,559
github and google twitter facebook they

857
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,840
know not to serve

858
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,880
to store plaintext passwords

859
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,399
they've great practices around not

860
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,840
storing plain text passwords

861
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,600
all of them have had this happen

862
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,679
because somebody an engineer somewhere

863
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,480
turned on logging

864
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
and i called this example out was i

865
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,919
think there's two

866
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,559
important lessons to take away from this

867
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,039
one

868
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,799
is this is not a good thing that

869
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,519
plaintext passwords were discovered at

870
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,880
organizations

871
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,000
it's it's it's it's bad

872
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
we should we should fix it it's a bad

873
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,600
thing that happened

874
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,320
there's almost zero risk to anybody

875
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,600
because of this these were all logging

876
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
incidents there's no data breaches

877
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
associated with it

878
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,360
there's no real negative outcome

879
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,679
it's something we need to fix but do do

880
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,480
we need

881
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
a bunch of news articles about it do we

882
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,039
need people

883
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
freaking out about this do we need

884
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,960
consumers to be worried that

885
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,559
their their google password has been

886
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,480
compromised no

887
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,559
no but that's how infosec is oriented

888
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,039
today because we spent a lot of time

889
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,399
focused on news rather than

890
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,799
what's likely to kill you what's like

891
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,640
most likely to cause a breach where do

892
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,840
we need to focus our

893
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,440
our time and energy that's that that's

894
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,120
number one number two

895
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,559
here is the root causes associated with

896
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,279
these even though all these

897
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,039
organizations have the same problem

898
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,360
there is no learning mechanism for them

899
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,480
to learn from each other

900
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,200
around exactly what happened how do i

901
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,240
prevent this

902
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,799
how do we detect it how do i know video

903
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,880
so everyone is left to their own devices

904
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,679
to try to

905
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,399
interpret from these news articles what

906
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,519
this means

907
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,440
what you should do about it and whether

908
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
or not it matters

909
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,200
um and that's just a huge missed

910
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,240
opportunity

911
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,960
both for these organizations to build

912
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,399
trust by saying

913
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,399
hey actually like there is no risk to

914
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,679
you this is

915
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,200
this is this is not this is not a big

916
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,760
deal but it's good hygiene and here's

917
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,679
here's what everyone should learn should

918
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,519
learn from this so we're doomed to keep

919
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,679
repeating the same mistakes

920
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,640
and dedicating precious time and

921
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,399
resources towards things that really

922
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,879
don't matter

923
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,720
one of the things that i think helps

924
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,559
this a lot

925
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,720
is developing a track record

926
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,200
of talking about the bad things that

927
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,000
happen

928
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,120
in cyber security on a on a

929
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,159
daily basis around setting this baseline

930
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,120
of we know we have vulnerabilities

931
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,200
vulnerabilities come out all the time

932
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,039
here's how we resolve them and

933
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,720
here's our process for letting you know

934
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,080
about something that really

935
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,640
affects you like here's how you as a

936
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,000
journalist can tell

937
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,399
that this was just another vulnerability

938
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,600
on a tuesday

939
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,000
versus this is newsworthy this is

940
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
something you need to write about

941
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,360
this is an example of starbucks here

942
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,560
which is um they're a a customer of ours

943
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,079
but they also have a very progressive

944
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,879
team that's very transparent with their

945
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,399
with their with their customers they

946
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,239
disclose most of the vulnerabilities

947
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,599
that are found

948
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,960
in their in their

949
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,280
technology stack for purposes of

950
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,320
helping others learn building

951
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,359
and establishing trust that that you can

952
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,159
trust them

953
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,440
and that even though they have

954
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,119
vulnerabilities and bad things can

955
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:35,679
happen

956
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,119
that they're proactive about it they're

957
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,760
taking steps to do it and most important

958
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,679
this helps disarm the daily news

959
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,520
of like if if a journalist should find

960
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,320
out about any one of these

961
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,239
vulnerabilities suddenly it's not news

962
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,040
anymore

963
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,639
it's just another vulnerability

964
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,159
that everybody has and uh

965
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,040
sorry it's it's not news there's nothing

966
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,400
to nothing to

967
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,839
explode over here

968
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,400
without this putting context if you were

969
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,040
to just

970
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,720
take this line right here

971
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,680
that feels like a news article right

972
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
feels like something that you would see

973
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,880
on the front page of the new york times

974
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,079
or

975
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,920
the guardian of like

976
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,400
but it's not news things like this

977
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,480
happen all the time

978
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,040
there's actually zero risk to consumers

979
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
consumers are

980
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,200
are safer because this happened

981
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,640
zero risk might be a little bit far but

982
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,320
in this particular case there was there

983
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,839
was no harm to consumers

984
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,160
no need to worry about it it was found

985
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,680
it was resolved

986
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,280
and now you are safer here than at

987
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,640
your data safer here than at other

988
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,960
places and that's that's important

989
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,480
progress that we that we don't talk

990
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,079
about

991
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,000
similarly the the department of defense

992
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,920
which is a very surprising source of

993
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,079
transparency to me in the united states

994
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,960
does the same thing um they they also

995
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,839
now share

996
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,920
a large majority of the vulnerabilities

997
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,760
that are discovered in their

998
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,720
in their systems for purposes of showing

999
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,240
that there's continuous improvement

1000
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,480
that they are trustworthy and helping

1001
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,160
others learn and this is this is

1002
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,240
just it's it's hard to understand how

1003
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
incredible it is for me to see this

1004
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,560
because there's

1005
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,440
so much that you can learn from looking

1006
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,000
at

1007
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,920
the bad things that happen to others and

1008
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,599
how they did it and applying that to

1009
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,760
your own programs for your own skill set

1010
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,960
um so i i'd um i'd call that out

1011
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,480
we try to correlate this as much as we

1012
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,160
can and make it as accessible as we can

1013
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,359
because i think there's an incredible

1014
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,400
amount of value

1015
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,680
in this transparency um but the

1016
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,400
the the meta benefit to the to your

1017
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,359
businesses

1018
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,839
and and the businesses that are

1019
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,440
protecting your data

1020
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,079
is that they're able to tell more

1021
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,359
confident stories

1022
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,480
about should you trust them with your

1023
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880
with your data and how can you expect

1024
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
them to respond if a bad thing

1025
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,680
that bad thing does happen

1026
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,520
to start all of this i think a lot of

1027
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,320
this begins with the

1028
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,040
acceptance that you're going to have

1029
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,920
vulnerabilities

1030
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,280
bad things are going to happen and you

1031
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,720
want to learn about them and you want to

1032
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,640
have a conversation about them

1033
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,520
unfortunately we're not there um this is

1034
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,480
getting better

1035
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,599
this number was 94 about 18 months ago

1036
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,440
now it's about 82 percent of the forbes

1037
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,160
global 2000 there so we're trending

1038
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
towards it but the vast majority of the

1039
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,560
largest businesses in the world

1040
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,520
that are protecting most of our data

1041
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,440
they do not have policies for vulnerable

1042
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,160
disclosure

1043
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,400
there is no transparency that you can

1044
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,280
expect from them

1045
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,800
other than a breach notification and

1046
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,960
there's no established process for you

1047
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,240
to point out a problem

1048
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,960
to them if it exists and the impact this

1049
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,480
has on the hacker community

1050
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,839
is of our

1051
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,280
community of hackers 63 of them have

1052
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,160
chosen

1053
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,200
not to report a vulnerability that they

1054
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,920
discovered

1055
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,200
this is an incredible missed opportunity

1056
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,400
to get more of this security feedback

1057
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,440
into organizations and develop positive

1058
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,640
conversations around

1059
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,839
how we get more secure um about 21

1060
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,280
of them say it's because they couldn't

1061
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,200
find out how to report

1062
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,520
um and another 15 said that they just

1063
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,480
got ignored

1064
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,680
even when they did um we've got to do

1065
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,839
better on on this front and it starts

1066
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,280
with transparency

1067
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,760
and hopefully leads towards towards

1068
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,680
trust

1069
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,079
uh breaking it down by i wanted to

1070
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,119
specifically pull

1071
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,160
some uh local city data for the

1072
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,000
the folks local there in in singapore

1073
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,920
y'all are home to

1074
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,560
uh a little more than a dozen of the

1075
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,240
forbes global 2000 unfortunately none of

1076
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,280
them have a process

1077
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,839
to uh reported security vulnerability to

1078
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,480
them

1079
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,520
um which i i i hope we can partner on

1080
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,040
on making better i want to i want to see

1081
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,640
this go up to uh

1082
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,920
uh a a fraction of a percent sometime in

1083
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,320
the

1084
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,760
uh in the next year i think weekend i

1085
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,599
think we can make progress on it um but

1086
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,200
the story is not that much better

1087
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
globally like uh the us only has 28

1088
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,480
um and uh that's that's the norm for

1089
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,680
most developed countries out there so

1090
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,200
we've got we've got a long way to go

1091
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,640
on this uh on this front i wanted to

1092
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,200
leave the

1093
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,520
transparency topic with uh one

1094
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,800
particular thought

1095
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,599
that is is one of the most predominant

1096
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,400
things that i

1097
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,640
i is on my mind these days and i hope

1098
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,079
you you would walk away from this which

1099
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,320
is

1100
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,839
fundamentally because of our aversion to

1101
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,400
transparency in

1102
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,320
cyber security we don't learn from our

1103
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,440
mistakes

1104
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,119
and we have to learn from our mistakes

1105
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,760
we have to figure out how to do this

1106
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,800
the stakes are just too high for

1107
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,480
learning from the mistakes of others to

1108
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
be a voluntary practice i think we've

1109
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,280
got to move

1110
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,200
towards a model where the norm is

1111
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,240
sharing it's in the data um i got this

1112
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,880
from uh

1113
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,599
alex damos in his blue hat keynote last

1114
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,079
year

1115
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,359
i encourage you to listen to it if

1116
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,720
you're if you're there but there's a

1117
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,160
great model for this

1118
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,720
in automotive and the aviation

1119
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,839
industries

1120
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,480
um where when there's a mistake or even

1121
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,319
a near miss

1122
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,680
there's a thorough incident

1123
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,680
investigation accident report and it's

1124
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,960
published for everyone to to review

1125
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,000
and learn from if we

1126
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,800
i think alex stamos said it said it

1127
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,680
quite well

1128
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,960
where um if the cyber if the aviation

1129
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,400
industry

1130
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,880
approached transparency and continuous

1131
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,520
improvement

1132
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
the same way that the cyber security

1133
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
industry does

1134
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,880
it would be impossible for us to fly

1135
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
like planes would be falling out of the

1136
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,000
sky left and right

1137
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,640
um it would it would be just a an

1138
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,880
unworkable industry

1139
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,960
and the model that they found for

1140
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,319
mistakes are going to happen

1141
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,480
that's okay you're there's a safe way to

1142
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,079
share without exposing yourself to

1143
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,240
additional liability and additional risk

1144
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,000
um and this is how we get better

1145
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,440
collectively as an industry

1146
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,280
is a powerful model for us to continue

1147
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,440
for us to consider as an industry

1148
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,280
i i think we have to figure out how to

1149
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,520
do this and my my dream is that we

1150
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,960
get to a world where transparent

1151
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,680
detailed incident reports are just the

1152
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,400
norm

1153
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,319
for cyber security whether it was a

1154
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,839
full-on breach or

1155
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,240
or a near miss if we can't figure out

1156
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,440
how to do this

1157
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,480
in a way that doesn't

1158
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,560
shame and disincentivize companies from

1159
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,000
doing so we're

1160
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,880
doomed to never move forward here um so

1161
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,440
i

1162
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,000
this is this is not going to be easy

1163
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,800
this is going to be

1164
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,400
a long way to go global so i want to

1165
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,160
encourage everyone to to do their small

1166
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,800
part

1167
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,280
to add a little bit of transparency to

1168
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,160
whatever

1169
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,520
area of information security you're

1170
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,280
working in um

1171
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,119
and a little bit at a time we can

1172
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,640
normalize like

1173
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,200
bad things happen here it's not news

1174
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,480
it's okay

1175
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,560
let's share we um

1176
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,880
we try to practice what we preach here

1177
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,480
at hacker one so

1178
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,560
in our in our contracts we commit to

1179
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,760
disclosing

1180
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,720
every security vulnerability in our

1181
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,079
environment

1182
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,480
no matter the matter the severity no

1183
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,760
matter how it looks

1184
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,319
um you can find this at hacka1.com

1185
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,200
security

1186
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,440
and browse through every security

1187
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
vulnerability we've had going back

1188
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,119
six years um including

1189
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,240
uh incidents that we have no obligation

1190
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,359
to report on i gave you an example here

1191
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,160
of a

1192
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,359
attack that we suffered in in october

1193
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,599
um no data breach involved so we don't

1194
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,119
have we don't have to tell anyone about

1195
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,440
it

1196
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,520
but we think it's a wasted opportunity

1197
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,880
for us to do that

1198
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,720
incident investigation and not share it

1199
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,800
with the world

1200
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,560
this is a this is not an easy thing to

1201
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,480
do it's a scary thing to do

1202
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,240
honestly um but we're going to have to

1203
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
take these little steps to show others

1204
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,640
that transparency is actually how we fix

1205
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,079
cyber security and

1206
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,160
and re-earn trust with everyone that

1207
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,800
we're building technology for

1208
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,359
so i wanted to uh leave you with those

1209
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,960
with those three thoughts for the day

1210
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,240
um hacking is good um if

1211
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,800
above everything else prioritize speed

1212
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,839
and

1213
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,560
please join me on my crusade for

1214
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,760
transparency

1215
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,359
we as an industry are not trusted

1216
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,440
people do not trust the technology that

1217
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,240
they depend upon they do not trust that

1218
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,240
when you enter data into a website that

1219
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,440
it won't get breached

1220
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,240
we have to turn that around and i don't

1221
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,440
see how we restore

1222
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,560
trust in our profession without

1223
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,800
bringing transparency to to bear on the

1224
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,240
