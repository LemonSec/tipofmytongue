1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,440
now

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
i'm really excited to welcome cinco 2020

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,639
conference

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,480
first keynote speaker up on our main

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,120
stage a man who needs no introduction

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
eugene kaspersky hello everybody

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,359
i am eugene kaspersky and welcome to the

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,000
cinco

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
conference uh unfortunately i am not

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,600
with you this time

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,960
let's speak about cyber security

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,279
we are living in a very interesting time

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,359
when the world is turning to the cyber

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,880
age

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
well the homo sapiens they were living

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
in a stone age then the bronze age

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,360
the iron age now some people say that we

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,800
are living in a plastic

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,280
age because like plastic now is the most

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,559
important material

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,559
and now we're turning from the plastic

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,239
age to the cyber age

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
but there are some barriers on on this

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
way

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
and the cyber crime and cyber threats is

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,360
one of them

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,680
uh actually the cyber crime is a global

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
problem uh every day we receive more

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,640
than four hundred thousand new malicious

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,360
files

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,880
every day more than four hundred

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,119
thousand uh it means that they are

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
massive the thousands of the cyber

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
criminals hackers bad guys

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
uh which are behind these cyber attacks

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,479
uh well technically speaking it's not

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,200
really

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
complicated to handle all that because

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
we have the machine learning systems

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
uh image recognition the behavior

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,640
recognition system which automatically

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,439
process

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,119
all that incoming stuff and release the

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,799
ad dot but don't

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,880
underestimate the power of the cyber

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,960
crime these junior cyber crimes

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
uh some equipment as they're learning uh

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,479
they're getting more experience that

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,320
they join the highly professional

50
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,159
criminal gangs

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
and they're able to attack even very

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
variable protected

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
enterprises businesses and even

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
industrial uh systems

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,799
industrial scada networks uh

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,920
and all that it's a very very huge very

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,960
important a big

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,759
danger uh for the cyber age uh when we

59
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,200
are living in the times

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,000
which we depend on cyber technologies

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
much more than before

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
cyber is everywhere around us vulnerable

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
and thousands of hackers are ready to

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,160
attack

65
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
their cyber systems that's why the cyber

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,480
security is getting much more important

67
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,680
than before

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
and maybe it's a good idea even to

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
switch from cyber security to cyber

70
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,040
immunity

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,280
and my definition of cyber immunity is

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,080
that

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,920
the system is immune if the attack

74
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
successful cyber attack costs more than

75
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,319
possible damage

76
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
so the criminals the bad guys they must

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
invest more

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
than possible profit uh and actually

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,400
based on the new technologies on the new

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,239
architecture of applications

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,760
uh i think i believe we are ready to

82
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
reach this level of security the level

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
of immunity and

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
security is a mask on your face and

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
immunity is injection

86
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,760
so i think it's time to switch

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
from the masks to injection and we are

88
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
working on that that's a good news

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,879
but there's so many systems around which

90
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,239
we need to redesign

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,440
um that's uh maybe not a bad news it's

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
also the good news for security experts

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,480
so

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,959
learn more talk to each other a be ready

95
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,840
show the

96
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,599
many new tasks which are ahead of us

97
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:32,798
thank you very much eugene kaspersky
