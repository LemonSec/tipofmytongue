hi all thank you for joining today's

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,080
demo session on sniper fish

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,199
myself is joseph nysel and along with me

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
we have jeb george who is also the

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,800
author of this storm

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,880
before we introduce ourselves i'll give

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,480
you a quick intro

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,160
on sniper fish so sniper fish is an open

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,680
source fishing toolkit

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,719
designed to quickly set up and

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,520
execute phishing engagements and

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
security awareness trainings

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,320
sniperfish make it easy for anyone to

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,199
create and run

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,520
phishing campaigns track user

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,760
interactions both web and email base

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,480
interaction centrally and then generate

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,920
customized reports

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,240
based on our requirement the toolkit

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
itself is designed in php

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and it supports both linux and windows

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,439
platform

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,840
the idea behind this tool is simple to

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
make it easy for someone who is new to

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,600
this field

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
to start setting up the phishing

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,600
environment

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
run the campaign and then observe the

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,119
results

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
while working with other uh open source

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,400
toolkits

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,119
out there similar to sniperfish we

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,720
observed that the most difficult thing

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,759
is one

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,119
to enable tracking for all user actions

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,600
throughout the campaign

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
uh to have customizations

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,159
uh based on the campaign requirement for

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,439
example

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,560
send delay between emails and the third

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,960
one would be to generate customized

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,159
reports based on the end user

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
requirement or the client requirement

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680
so with sniperfish we believe all these

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,479
challenges

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,360
would be addressed

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,199

image space phishing attack we know that

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,120
most of the

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
phishing attacks are carried through

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640

fish

124
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
we can see why we developed our sniper

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,120
fish

126
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
and what are his components what are its

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,320
features

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,240
etc next i will be showing you the demo

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,360
it's from the um the demo will

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
we will start from the scratch like in

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,479
starting from

132
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,400
installation configuration then we will

133
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,680
send a test phishing campaign and based

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,560
on the art

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,680
we will analyze the result after the

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,320
demo

137
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,919
we will see what are the future

138
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
plans we are going to introduce into our

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
sniper page what are the new modules

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,880
extra

141
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,440
and after that we are wrapping up

142
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
let's go to next slide

143
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
phishing and effective social

144
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,800
engineering attack

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
we know fishing is the one of the

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,919
commonly used

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,440
and effective forces engineering attack

148
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,360
used to target organization or

149
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
any company let's see what are the types

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,280
of

151
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
fishing attacks and what are the parties

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
determining is success

153
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
first the type for phishing attacks

154
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,680
first one is

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
spearfishing we know it's a targeted

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,720
attack

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
that we call as peer cashing maybe we

158
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
are targeting

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
a company or organization directly

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,240
the next one is mailing that means we

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,280
are focused

162
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,400
on sitting on higher class employees

163
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
like a ctoc

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
ceo etc the clone phishing is

165
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,639
we know we have seen a lot of phishing

166
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,680
websites like

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
the clone of facebook or chrono linkedin

168
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,880
gmail etc we are creating clone of the

169
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,400
login or clone of those website

170
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,919
to perform the phishing attack

171
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,199
next one is wishing attack use we use

172
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
telephone or any voice method

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
to carry out the phishing attack next

174
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
one is fishing

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,160
we will be sending a sms message or any

176
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
text message to

177
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,560
conduct phishing attacks

178
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
uh let's see what are the factors

179
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,280
determining the success of

180
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,319
an effective phishing attack one is

181
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,680
being stealthy

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
that means if you are sending an email

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,639
it should not be suspicious

184
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,160
the employees will be or any in the

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,960
target

186
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,840
victims should be able to realize this

187
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,199
is a real

188
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
email and they should respond to the

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,400
email accordingly

190
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,520
on the fish that means the

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,280
information we want to

192
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
get after conducting a phishing attack

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,319
maybe

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,880
if we are creating a clone of gmail

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,680
and if we are sending that to the

196
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,639
victims

197
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,440
the meetings are supposed to submit

198
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,160
their

199
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
email address and their password

200
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,960
so after that we got our

201
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,919
the we got the required information

202
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,639
that's the

203
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,360
page but for what we are contacting the

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,319
fishing attack

205
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,599
we need to get those details get the

206
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,960
data from the meeting

207
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,840
now next we will be explaining the next

208
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,440
slide

209
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,080
okay now we can talk about a typical

210
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,280
phishing attack

211
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,319
we have an attacker and a victim user

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
a tackle crafts email after collecting

213
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,720
information

214
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,199
about the target victim or the victim

215
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,800
organization

216
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
and then send the email with the

217
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
phishing ur

218
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,599
uh using the configured mail server

219
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
the main server can be his own main

220
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,160
server or a third party relay server

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,319
and the attacker would use that to send

222
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,280
the

223
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,440
uh malicious or the phishing email to

224
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
the victim user

225
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
once the victim user receives the email

226
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,799
he would have gone through the email

227
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,360
and probably might have clicked the

228
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
phishing url

229
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,279
which would redirect the user to the web

230
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,080
server

231
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,160
posting the uh malicious uh

232
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,920
phone or a survey page

233
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,080
and the malicious form could be similar

234
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,360
to a

235
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
microsoft login page or a company portal

236
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,839
and the user would be

237
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,880
user might think that it would be

238
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,399
legitimate and he would

239
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,240
enter his credentials or a token

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,000
based on how the portal works

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
and then those details will be captured

242
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,680
by the

243
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
attacker that i can also

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
along with the url he might have

245
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
imported

246
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,360
other tracking codes which could be used

247
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,720
to capture or track the user

248
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
interactions let's say

249
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,839
whether the email has been received by

250
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
the victim user

251
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
uh whether he had access the email

252
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
whether he had clicked on the

253
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,720
my issues ur whether he had submitted

254
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
the credentials all these can be tracked

255
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,040
by the attacker by using a tracking code

256
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,720
uh embedded within the uh html code

257
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
or within the email content itself

258
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
now we are going to talk about in more

259
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,240
detail about the production approach

260
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
fishing approach so we start with

261
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
information gathering we look for

262
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,839
information about the company or the

263
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,120
organization

264
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
we look for information about the users

265
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,200
their email ids email id formats we look

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,680
for

267
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,480
sample email templates to understand the

268
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,440
writing styles

269
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
logos signatures phones they use

270
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
we look for uh websites or portals

271
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,600
belonging to the client

272
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
we we research to see whether they're

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
using

274
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,839
any uh cloud based focus like microsoft

275
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
azure or adfish

276
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,279
scenario preparation phase where we need

277
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,000
to

278
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,320
create scenarios which is more realistic

279
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
we can look for any recent

280
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,320
events that has happened in the company

281
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,920
or any

282
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
events that is going to happen we can

283
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,200
look for

284
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,040
news or articles related to the

285
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
organization

286
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,839
to get an understanding of any such

287
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,480
things happening and then we can produce

288
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
that to prepare the scenario

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,079
or we could have any scenario which is

290
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:18,959
more generic

291
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,320
in instance for example

292
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
uh surveys or anything related to

293
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,959
something happening in the region or

294
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,359
country

295
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
from you can kind of a promotion or

296
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,680
something like that and then

297
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,839
based on the scenario which has been

298
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,839
finalized we need to purchase our domain

299
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,120
so

300
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,040
it's better to look for a domain which

301
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,920
has some categorization

302
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,399
uh we could easily look for expired

303
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,920
domains belonging to the

304
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
organization which we are targeting or

305
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,200
we could

306
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,720
look for domains which are more

307
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
apt for our scenario

308
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,480
once uh the domain uh

309
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,519
is finalized we need to choose the

310
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,000
phishing framework

311
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
while choosing the phishing framework

312
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
make sure

313
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,399
the one we choose is more easy to set up

314
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,920
and has good level of customization

315
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,120
to meet our requirements

316
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,240
then we can uh we need to set up the

317
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,120
main server

318
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,880
you can set it to our run main server or

319
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,639
we can go for any third party

320
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,000
relay quiz make sure

321
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,639
we uh configure the security address

322
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,959
like spf dkmp mark

323
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
and create a host or create the host

324
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,079
reports for that

325
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,279
then set up the phishing website

326
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,839
so this is where the

327
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,639
website isn't designed internally

328
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
in terms of how we need to

329
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,480
uh make it legitimate for example it

330
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,120
could be

331
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
a clone of the company portal or it

332
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,839
could be a

333
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,680
cloud portal kind of a microsoft cloud

334
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,560
portal

335
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,839
which is used for logging into the

336
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,760
organization network

337
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,920
the phishing website we can have the our

338
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,959
tracking code

339
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,519
or the code which is used to capture the

340
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,120
credentials

341
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
we can have it uh embedded to the phone

342
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,320
and uh once the phishing website is set

343
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,639
up

344
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
we need to host it we can host it uh by

345
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,120
our own or we can you

346
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,880
use any web hosting service

347
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
once that is done we can connect

348
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
our main server with the fishing toolkit

349
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,360
or the phishing framework

350
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,079
and then configure the landing pages

351
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,399
like

352
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,880
once the user clicks the uh email

353
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
link in the email where it should land

354
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,839
the users too

355
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,120
and then we need to test the setup we

356
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,839
need to

357
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,000
do trial runs to make sure that emails

358
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
are getting delivered

359
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,880
uh our code is working proper

360
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,639
uh we are able to capture the

361
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
credentials and

362
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,440
the website is looking nice to me all

363
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,560
the security

364
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
ssl based and ssl settings have been

365
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
enabled

366
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,639
and once we are ready to go

367
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,240
we can we can start with the campaign

368
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,519
and uh wait for the research

369
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,360
when we start the campaign make sure we

370
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,760
are not sending all the emails at one

371
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,160
point rather we can have a send delay

372
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,639
between emails because normally if

373
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,000
you're sending or triggering all the

374
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
immediate tips at a single point in time

375
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,800
it would be considered as an attack and

376
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,079
there's high chance that our

377
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,360
id might get blacklisted now

378
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,000
we need to wait for the means to get

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,959
daily word

380
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,480
the user to access it and then he clicks

381
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
click see you are wishing you are and

382
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
where you will be redirected to the

383
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,800
phishing form

384
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
to submit the credentials we would run

385
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
the campaign for at least like

386
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,639
a week or so and then uh observe the

387
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
results

388
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,600
we need to generate the report based on

389
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,040
our requirements and then

390
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,599
submit into a customer or end user

391
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,440
so now the question is why sniper fish

392
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,399
so here we are highlighting some of the

393
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,920
key

394
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,519
features or what we think

395
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,040
would add value or benefit to the

396
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
users for sniper fish we are not going

397
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,920
to talk about the common features which

398
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,680
are available in most of the platforms

399
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,199
we are going to talk about something

400
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,399
that is specific to sniper fish here

401
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,199
so the first point is like uh we can

402
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:13,920
combine

403
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,680
email and web-based phishing campaigns

404
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,600
observe the results on a centralized

405
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,519
dashboard and generates a report

406
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,639
from both the campaigns

407
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
we can avoid website specific tracker

408
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,920
coding there's no need for that

409
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
we can generate tracker codes directly

410
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
from sniper fish

411
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,759
which is javascript based codes

412
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,399
and since most of the browsers or the

413
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,120
web server supports javascript

414
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
the tracker code can be added to any

415
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,839
kind of website

416
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
there is no limitation on the number of

417
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,759
track codes that can be generated we can

418
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,720
have

419
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,959
multiple tracker codes generated and we

420
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,880
can use that to

421
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,119
track phishing website having n number

422
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,280
of pages

423
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,319
other option we have incorporated is

424
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,959
like

425
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,199
main sending customization for example

426
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,240
sending delays between emails meet

427
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,679
privacy production laws and

428
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,640
policies like uh we have options

429
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,400
customized options where

430
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,520
we can choose what to be recorded or

431
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,880
what to be

432
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,080
generated in the report by this we can

433
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,960
avoid any

434
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
post identified data from the report

435
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,440
which is getting generated

436
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,200
to minimize report modifications we have

437
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,240
uh enabled

438
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,000
options to select multiple fields

439
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,120
from what has been recorded and we have

440
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
different timestamps format

441
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
so you can choose what can what need to

442
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,960
be recorded and in what time format

443
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,960
something that provides a modern

444
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
approach uh we have

445
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
options to have qr codes or barcode

446
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,000
instead of phishing urls in the email

447
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
template

448
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,200
so mobile users can use it your import

449
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,039
scanners directly

450
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,160
open the email and scan for this qr

451
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,039
codes

452
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,440
which will take them to the phishing

453
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,000
website

454
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,799
convenient way to handle payloads

455
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
this is still in development uh at

456
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,200
present we are

457
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,240
hosting the payload uh

458
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,840
in the same server uh and uh

459
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
the payload which is hosted the files

460
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,840
which you are trying to upload

461
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,440
or the plain text

462
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,120
uh payload which you are trying to copy

463
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,520
would get uploaded and you would be

464
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,960
provided with a

465
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,120
link to access it we have also included

466
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
encoding and encryption options at

467
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
present we have only

468
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,200
uh encoding options enabled we are also

469
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,320
trying to bring in

470
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,360
encryption of options like xor

471
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,799
aes currently we have base64

472
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,360
base 32 and other options enabled like

473
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,080
route 13.

474
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
we think uh these options would be

475
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,400
helpful for you

476
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
and uh make your life easier

477
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,120
when setting up a phishing campaign

478
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,039
running the campaign and generating the

479
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,440
report

480
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,480
okay now we are going to talk about the

481
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
core components of sniperfish

482
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,600
the first would be the email campaign

483
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
manager this this is where

484
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,320
all our campaigns would get listed we

485
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,080
also have options to configure user

486
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,679
groups and email templates specific for

487
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,559
the campaign

488
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,200
we can also configure our main relay

489
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
server

490
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,880
which could be used to relay emails from

491
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,320
the phishing toolkit to the

492
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,200
victim user next we have the web tracker

493
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,799
generator this is where the tracker code

494
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,080
would get generated

495
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,600
we have multiple options to choose from

496
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
depending upon what we need to track for

497
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,559
example

498
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,360
the visiting time the victim os ip

499
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,679
address like public private ip address

500
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,400
browser agent the browser type extra now

501
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,480
we have the symbol tracker module

502
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,559
as a name so this it works as a simple

503
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,120
tracker and it can be used for either

504
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,600
email or web-based campaigns next we

505
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,520
have the report generator

506
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,799
this is where we could list our

507
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,559
completed campaigns and then generate

508
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,159
customized reports

509
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,799
based on our requirements it supports

510
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,480
reports in csv

511
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,440
excel and pdf format then we have two

512
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,039
add-ons which is payloads

513
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,080
of and where nodes this is where is used

514
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,720
for

515
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,480
uploading our malicious dll or exe files

516
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,880
and converting that to reflective

517
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,559
payloads which could be injected in

518
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,280
memory

519
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,799
from powershell sniper host

520
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,120
the final payload which is generated can

521
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
be copied here

522
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
in plain text and then uh can be

523
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,559
converted to a

524
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,200
download url with the help of sniper

525
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
host

526
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,720
it also supports encoding options like

527
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
base62 or base

528
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
uh 32 or base64

529
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
and also we can set the content type

530
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,880
header like what content type that we

531
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,159
need to set here

532
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,240
the payloads can be hosted uh on the

533
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,520
same server which is

534
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,760
where the toolkit is running or on a

535
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
different server just we need to

536
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,559
hard code the name of the uh server

537
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:40,960
where

538
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,840
the payloads need to be hosted

539
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,760
so let's move into our demo session here

540
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,600
we are starting from the scratch

541
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,240
initially we will install sniper fish

542
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,360
into our web

543
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,559
server then we will configure it after

544
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,320
that we will be creating a

545
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
simple phishing campaign consisting both

546
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,520
email

547
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,080
and the phishing website so this

548
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,880
campaign will be

549
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,799
targeting our own company it's a demo

550
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,080
company we created for this demo

551
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
and we have some employees in the

552
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,360
company and we

553
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,480
we attach it in to those employees

554
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,280
so initially then let's see what are the

555
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,840
prerequisites

556
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
so sniper fish requires a web server and

557
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,960
mis

558
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,080
db initially so the web server should be

559
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,880
supporting

560
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,280
php 7.3 version of list

561
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,640
and then sniper which we will be saving

562
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
its data in mi square db

563
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,200
so here we have already sub domains in

564
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,840
sniperface.com so we are hosting

565
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
centerfish here let's see

566
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,720
our hosting let's

567
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,080
open our file manager

568
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,880
so this is our subdomain root directory

569
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,720
let's upload our sniper fish files here

570
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,360
i have already downloaded the files here

571
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,280
this is a sniper face file you can

572
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,039
download it from our

573
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,799
github repository so now let's upload

574
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,640
this

575
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,280
after uploading we will unzip this and

576
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,320
we after

577
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
that we can remove this zip file

578
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,880
so it looks uploaded successfully let's

579
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
refresh here our sniper page

580
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,159
we are starting here

581
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,760
so it's unzipped so

582
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,080
we can delete this file because we

583
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,799
normally

584
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,080
no longer needed this

585
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
let's see

586
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
we are copying the domain here so

587
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,840
initially we need to go to install

588
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
so this the pre requirements are checked

589
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,159
already

590
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,440
the snap php is 7.3.1

591
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,200
so it means the requirement we have imap

592
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,760
extensions enabled gd extension enabled

593
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
and select equation

594
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,000
function useful for enabled the next

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
step is we need

596
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,360
db name this is the dba

597
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,520
host it's localhost by default because

598
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,120
we are hosting

599
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,880
we are using the database in the same

600
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,840
server and we have username

601
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,960
and password is needed your email is

602
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,760
something like

603
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,200
we can provide in just we forget our

604
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,760
sniper face login password we will get

605
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,480
in this

606
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,440
email address so we need all these

607
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,080
details

608
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
initially so we can go to our hosting

609
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,080
and then

610
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,200
we can create a database

611
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,200
and username password etc

612
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
so let's check for database we have a

613
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
mysql database here

614
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,879
now we are going to create a new

615
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,000
database

616
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,640
important just create it

617
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,240
we have

618
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,840
we are copying this database name here

619
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:10,799
now we need a created database user

620
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
so the password is something we need to

621
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,960
get we are using buffer generator for

622
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,600
this you need a new password

623
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,200
then we are copying this

624
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,000
if the password okay we are copying this

625
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,720
password here

626
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,480
now you're saying in this the

627
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,159
database you finish this one

628
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
now we have created database and the

629
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,120
database user

630
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,159
now we need to add this new user to our

631
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,720
database

632
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,799
so this is a user

633
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,000
and we have database here that we

634
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,720
created

635
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,080
here adding this to our database and we

636
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,039
are selecting all privileges

637
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,760
make changes

638
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,840
so the user is already added to the

639
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,399
database

640
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,360
now let's go back here for installation

641
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,840
then

642
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,799
we are providing the village

643
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,240
db name then

644
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,840
bb username

645
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,480
then db password

646
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,760
so i am giving info

647
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,640
commas my email address this time this

648
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,840
one

649
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,159
then after selecting find time form we

650
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,880
click install

651
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,159
installation success network which will

652
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,320
be redirected login screen

653
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,520
so installation is completed it's a

654
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,000
i think it's a easy step it's a very

655
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
easy to install sniper page if you have

656
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,320
all

657
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,440
three requirements um

658
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,080
username by default administer username

659
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,960
password is

660
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,159
sniperfish itself

661
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,240
sniperfish in small letters

662
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,600
so this is the login home screen if you

663
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,760
have created any campaigns here it will

664
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,159
be

665
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,159
displayed in the main dashboard

666
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,520
currently we have

667
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,240
no mail campaign no web trackers no

668
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
symbol trackers

669
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
and we have not done any campus

670
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,080
have been before so

671
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,120
i will be explaining all these details

672
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,559
later once we create a single

673
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,000
fishing campaign so basically to create

674
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,240
a

675
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,559
phishing campaign we need to go through

676
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,320
the web tracker

677
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,600
menu and then email campaign menu and

678
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,399
this

679
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,039
two the remaining modules i will be

680
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,440
explaining later

681
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,480
so we have configured sniper page

682
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,960
now let's create a campaign

683
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,480
to create a campaign uh we will be

684
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
having

685
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,919
a sato sorry maybe we need a phishing

686
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,960
website

687
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,159
and then we need a company

688
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,559
thursday company we have our own demo

689
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,720
company here

690
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,080
so initially let's create let's host our

691
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
phishing

692
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,360
website

693
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,879
so we are going to our hosting

694
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,600
opening our file manager here

695
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
then we have created a sub domain

696
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,039
and here i have already hosted a

697
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,880
phishing website

698
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,559
you can see that fishing with it so

699
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,799
opening this arm you can see we have

700
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,520
two html pages here so it's a simple

701
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,159
phrasing website we have a login page

702
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,080
then form page then thank you url

703
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,840
now we can go to

704
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,799
our login page

705
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,720
so this is a derma company login page

706
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
and we can see

707
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,080
our phone page

708
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,200
from which then

709
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,120
thank you so

710
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,799
it's a plain html using javascript

711
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,760
and css

712
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,919
basically i will be explaining the

713
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,159
scenario like this is our phishing

714
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,279
website since

715
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,240
we are the user is or the target victim

716
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,279
is supposed to

717
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,360
submit their email address here password

718
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,240
here then they will be pressing a login

719
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,279
button so these two will be

720
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,840
tracking our sniper page

721
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,600
then this will be a price of something's

722
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,960
form

723
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,240
so he will submit a user in name

724
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
and iphone caller and their address to

725
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,559
claim this place

726
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,880
so based on this we will be creating a

727
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,760
scenario

728
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,440
in the email body and we are sending

729
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,919
this

730
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,200
email to the user like that like this so

731
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,720
you are one of our our valuable customer

732
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,120
sorry you're one of our valuable

733
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,880
employee and

734
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,799
we are providing a iphone as a gift and

735
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,559
you may submit this data into our

736
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,960
phishing website so they are supposed to

737
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,840
open this website and submit that and

738
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,240
their personal details so

739
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
we will come into our phishing email

740
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,279
later

741
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,960
now let's configure this phishing

742
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
website so

743
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,480
when you frame that that i submitted to

744
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,600
the phishing website

745
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,000
we need to capture these details in your

746
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
sniper page

747
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,480
so for that

748
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,120
we have a web tracker page here we are

749
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,240
creating a

750
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,120
new tracker

751
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,679
so initially to capture

752
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,080
data from the phishing website we need

753
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,519
to

754
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,519
create the capture based on our phishing

755
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,760
website and we need to implement that

756
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,159
so the tracker is actually a javascript

757
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,399
truck we will be adding this to our

758
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,679
phishing website for all

759
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,519
data submitted in in the phishing

760
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,360
website will be tracking by two of

761
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
snipers

762
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,480
server so let's see what

763
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,000
is in our phishing website

764
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,360
the login.html first we will be and

765
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,919
the link we are providing in the mail

766
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,120
body will be

767
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,559
opening this login page so let's

768
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,279
edit this

769
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,200
so this is our phishing

770
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,240
website login page we can see it's a

771
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,360
some css jquery let's know this here is

772
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,640
our login

773
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,000
field so we have

774
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,039
two input fields like one is login

775
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,760
you name field for summiting email

776
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,880
address and one for

777
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,320
password and one is summation vector so

778
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,240
what we are doing is we need to track

779
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,519
these two

780
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,240
and the action of summation so let's

781
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,679
create a tracker corresponding to this

782
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,720
going to sniper fish then we create

783
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,760
a tracker name for example

784
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,559
it can be my

785
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,560
company to my company so we are

786
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,239
selecting what our

787
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,520
data has to be tracked so we have

788
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
when we when the website is open we will

789
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,199
be tracking the reset time

790
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,879
then public id private id web browser

791
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,639
detailed operating system users and

792
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,399
all general details are dropping

793
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,159
tracking

794
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,719
so here is a public iep this one

795
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,760
actually is

796
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,960
used by webrtci apa

797
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,079
usually latest browsers are this issue

798
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,000
so if if your attached company

799
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,159
will be using an older version of web

800
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,199
browser like

801
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,440
google chrome or firefox we will get a

802
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,119
private ip also

803
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,520
that's the internal ib so next

804
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,800
here we are adding each with webpages in

805
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,000
our fishing page

806
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,480
to be tracked so the first way is our

807
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,359
login page

808
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,560
so we are providing some name so

809
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,760
page then the phishing page

810
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,160
url

811
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,720
so this is our phishing page url

812
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
then the form elements we know we have a

813
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,720
email field

814
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,359
and a password period so it's actually a

815
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,160
test field

816
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,000
so we need to add id value of

817
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,839
this email address but it's a um

818
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,119
then we have a password field it's

819
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,760
actually a test field itself

820
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,880
we are copying password

821
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,720
new password slide dna

822
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,839
and we have a button that need to be

823
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:48,320
dragged

824
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,880
which is a submission button actually it

825
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,640
says

826
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,000
copy this id value

827
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,400
and then we have created first page

828
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,079
we have created tracker for the first

829
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,160
page then we are

830
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,240
we have a home page here

831
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,520
we need to track details from this also

832
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,359
so now let's

833
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,799
go back to our form page

834
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,920
we are editing a form page here

835
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,720
you can see

836
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,839
the field elements its

837
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,560
first name is apple name full name is

838
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,520
the id value

839
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,720
then we have a select field then we have

840
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
a text area here

841
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,240
then we have submission button so

842
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,960
now we are going to create tracker for

843
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,240
the second page

844
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,920
for the second home page so we added one

845
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,119
more page here

846
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,480
and the page name we some name like

847
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,880
page

848
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,560
so spg url is actually

849
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,240
html we are copying this one

850
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,720
or so we paste it here now we are adding

851
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,800
the form elements here

852
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,520
let's check here it's a first one is a

853
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,800
input field

854
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,240
it's a test field actually so we are

855
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,320
creating a test field

856
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,520
under here then the second one is

857
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,040
select build selecting font color

858
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,920
select beard click on color

859
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,880
then it's a text area field here it's

860
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,730
the id's user address

861
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,680
[Music]

862
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,480
text you select test area then add this

863
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,599
id value

864
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,720
then finally it's a submission button

865
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,640
so it's from it

866
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,359
so we ordered all tracking details

867
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,160
to generate a tracker so this final

868
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,520
destination url is

869
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,680
actually we can submit a thank you url

870
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,720
copy this uh we are not really tracking

871
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,000
in the final destination url so we have

872
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
three pages here but we are tracking the

873
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,320
first and second page that is the

874
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,440
initial login page

875
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,200
and the home page so if we don't have a

876
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,880
finite destination url just

877
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,119
submit just a places hash

878
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,520
so we have a final page here the

879
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,720
destination url

880
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,560
then press nest so we have already

881
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,240
created the tracker here

882
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,520
this is our tracker code we already

883
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,640
have this jquery

884
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,880
in our website so we don't need to

885
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,320
you can see the jquery already

886
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,160
in our website we don't need to add this

887
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,440
jquery but

888
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,560
we are we need to add this tracker code

889
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,440
here

890
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,480
so we are placing this dragon code

891
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,960
in both login page as well as combat

892
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,839
just place like this

893
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,480
we are crossing this then

894
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,040
here

895
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,880
so we added our tracker page to both

896
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,320
login as well as home page so if anyone

897
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,040
open this login page or home page or any

898
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,079
submitted data

899
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,760
every track in the sniper page

900
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,839
now we are closing this

901
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,320
in case we want to see the tracker code

902
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,520
we can you can see

903
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
here it's a tracker port that's

904
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,160
generated automatically

905
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,760
so it's a simple web form based

906
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,280
on what we provided in the tracker

907
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,440
code section like we have provided a

908
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,359
username and password two input build

909
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,079
one foundation button similarly

910
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,160
we have provided one color

911
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,960
uh full name field then first of all

912
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,040
name field then font color select

913
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,960
select uh html and

914
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,520
then test area then one summation but i

915
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,160
said just a

916
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,960
so if you want to download this zip file

917
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,400
you can download that

918
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,800
but if we are running this phishing

919
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,119
campaign in a real case scenario

920
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,200
we will be creating a phishing website

921
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,800
as a

922
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,400
good appearance like it will not be

923
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,240
the user will not suspect that that's a

924
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,160
phishing website we'll be using

925
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,520
css css javascript good stuff like that

926
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,640
to beautify the machine but this is just

927
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:12,960
a

928
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,000
html html switch for just

929
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
you need if you want to try out how this

930
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,280
works it will

931
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,680
separate the html code automatic in the

932
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,880
background if you can

933
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,079
host this html by downloading

934
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,760
from here so we created

935
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,880
a phishing port now let's

936
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,839
let's save

937
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,240
so it's time to now

938
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,079
now we go a tracker list we have created

939
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,960
a tracker for this phishing website

940
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,200
now it started tracking already since we

941
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,040
already started

942
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,200
whenever you for visit the web website

943
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,079
will be tracked

944
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,200
now just

945
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,560
give you a quick check report you can

946
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
you can see no data because no one has

947
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,880
opened our machine website and submitted

948
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,400
any data

949
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,280
so we are now going to create an email

950
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,000
campaign

951
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,240
we are sending this url in the fishing

952
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,119
web phishing mail body

953
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,440
then the user will be you know the

954
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,280
target victim will be clicking on the

955
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,560
switching website

956
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,160
and he will be opening the phishing

957
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,240
website and submitting data

958
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,160
so we will get recorded here

959
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,760
now let's create a email campaign

960
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
for these are the prerequisites for

961
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,520
running web email

962
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,760
champion fishing website we hosted here

963
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,960
mydermalcommunion.com we already created

964
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,119
the phishing website and hosted

965
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,880
and already configured the phishing

966
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,200
website now

967
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,160
to create it and send an email we need

968
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,280
email standard details like smdp info

969
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,240
then we need attached to use accounts

970
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,720
then

971
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,680
we need to create a mail body it's a

972
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,200
mail body

973
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,119
that we are sending to the phishing

974
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,760
users

975
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,800
now let's go to the second step

976
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,960
it's a mail center details something

977
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,160
details so

978
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,800
to send an email we need some dbp info

979
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:41,839
just create a smdp mail account

980
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,160
so we have five accounts here

981
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,599
this based on our scenario we have a

982
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,760
demo company and we have admin

983
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,480
and some of the users here we have a ceo

984
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,040
user

985
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,240
here so we are in the scenario we are

986
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,160
actually sending an email from

987
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,440
our ceo's account

988
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,640
so in this case we are using the ceo's

989
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,280
email account username and password so

990
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,079
let's check this

991
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,800
we need is connect configuration details

992
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,680
here's the details

993
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,440
in the sniper page we are going to

994
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,839
create center list

995
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,280
we are creating a new mail center here

996
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,240
just to provide

997
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,599
some name it says ceo just

998
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,880
fling that just saying it's uh

999
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
we are going to send from a csmail

1000
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,760
account smdb server details we need to

1001
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,680
provide fmdp

1002
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
democratic

1003
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,440
so from address is says ceo's mail

1004
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,000
account

1005
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,839
so copy the mail account

1006
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,760
so already tried this before so we can

1007
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
build like this so basically this is the

1008
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,560
name and this is the mail account we are

1009
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,240
using

1010
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,520
uh this is a conditioning basically

1011
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,319
to send the email snipers need to log

1012
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,599
into the mail server

1013
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,040
then send an email so this is can be the

1014
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,920
same as

1015
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,040
serious account uh

1016
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,720
we need to provide a password here

1017
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,599
unfortunately i don't i'm not

1018
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,079
remembering the password let's

1019
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,160
reset the password for the serious user

1020
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,119
um manage

1021
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,240
generate a new password uh we are

1022
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,359
copying this password

1023
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,040
update settings so we reset the password

1024
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,319
we are providing this account password

1025
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,119
here

1026
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,960
and some mailbox details actually

1027
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,560
this is useful for if we in this type of

1028
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,800
session we have a picture that if we are

1029
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,280
when we send an email to our victim the

1030
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,319
meeting can respond like who is this

1031
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,280
you are like that they may suspect that

1032
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,920
it

1033
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,480
or they may reply and ask for more

1034
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,040
details about this email like that

1035
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,480
so any request to the pc mail can be

1036
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,119
tracked with this sniper page we need to

1037
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,119
configure the mailbox latest

1038
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,560
so it's a i'm up path

1039
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,839
so it's is in the form of shown below

1040
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,359
so i'm configuring this so

1041
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,319
mailbox we need to privatize and send

1042
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,520
usually comes into

1043
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,960
inbox you know so we are adding this

1044
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,440
for this mailbox path for income emails

1045
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,720
if you want to know this this is

1046
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,640
configured this is mentioned here

1047
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,839
manage

1048
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,480
so we are using the incoming mail server

1049
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,280
details here

1050
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,119
so let's verify this arc or not and just

1051
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,079
let me

1052
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,640
let me explain once again this appears

1053
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,319
something to be server

1054
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,319
from address you may consist with with

1055
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,319
the from an account username

1056
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,200
from is usually something like if the

1057
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,280
user receives some mail and

1058
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,680
then they send back if by default the

1059
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,760
from address will be selected

1060
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,119
so if you own a domain and you are

1061
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:01,760
sending a

1062
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,240
mail from you can send mail from any of

1063
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,520
the email address like

1064
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,920
you it's something it will send

1065
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,640
automatically

1066
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,880
from this from this address even though

1067
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,480
the mailbox is not created for this user

1068
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,720
so according to me something we created

1069
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,079
in the server

1070
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,920
you have seen the csmail account we

1071
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,760
created it we are using this username

1072
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,240
and password

1073
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,200
so now let's verify this

1074
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,720
so the mailbox path is successfully

1075
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,319
verified the account credentials are

1076
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,440
successful

1077
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,400
also we can try sending a test email

1078
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:38,800
under

1079
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,079
test mail we are sending an

1080
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,119
email to our test gmail account just

1081
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,480
click send you can see the

1082
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,280
mail is sent successfully let's check

1083
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,920
our inbox

1084
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,839
we have received our mail here

1085
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,240
so sniper fish is able to send mail

1086
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,359
right now we are crossing the mail

1087
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,680
account

1088
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,160
let's we have saved our sender we

1089
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,040
created a sender here

1090
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,319
now next step is creating a user group

1091
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,880
insert group is actually the targeting

1092
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,480

1097
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,839
let's check this

1098
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,520

we have our center list ready

1113
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,680
user group ready now the next step

1114
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,119
is creating an email template so this is

1115
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,800
the email we are going to

1116

this

1133
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,119
let's quickly

1134
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,839
modify this alignment

1135
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,400
so this is a

1136
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,040
template let's check this source code

1137
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,960
we can see the html body here but

1138
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,319
we missed some details like we need to

1139
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,760
add our tracking code

1140
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,119
and then we need to add our phishing

1141
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,119
website url so it's like

1142
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,839
dear access just we can provide

1143
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,359
employees name here

1144
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,440
you have a field name here

1145
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,760
just put here like this

1146
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,240
just disabling text so whenever the user

1147
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,440
the target email and whenever the

1148
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,000
recipient there is a mail their email

1149
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,440
their name will be displayed here

1150
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,079
instead of

1151
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,440
name field so based on

1152
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,720
this email body we need a

1153
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,040
report porter we already know

1154
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,880
we have created a fishing website we

1155
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,280
need to try that fishing website

1156
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,720
so let's click this

1157
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,920
link so

1158
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,119
this is the display link

1159
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,880
we have fishing website here

1160
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:45,759
login.html we are copying this

1161
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,559
this is your first page will be opening

1162
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:51,520
once the

1163
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,599
employee click the link on the email

1164
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,119
body so

1165
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,960
here what we need to add additionally

1166
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,520
and we what we have to what we are

1167
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,280
required to add additionally is that

1168
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,559
there is a field like this c i

1169
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,440
d equal to

1170
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,880
so let me explain this we have a cid

1171
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,359
here started process united so instead

1172
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,720
identify who picked this link we need to

1173
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,440
provide some value so based on each

1174
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,359
recipient

1175
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,520
the city value will be unique for them

1176
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,680
so if we are adding like this

1177
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,880
we will be able to track which

1178
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,040
user in the email click click the

1179
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,079
website link

1180
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,920
so we already configured here let's

1181
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,799
check the source code

1182
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,200
we can see the cid is already configured

1183
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,880
here it's the

1184
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,920
first link

1185
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,280
now here we create

1186
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,640
the fishing male body almost

1187
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,680
now one thing is also missing that is

1188
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,319
we need to track this email whether it

1189
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,040
is open

1190
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,160
or not so for that we can add one

1191
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,760
tracker code here we have option here to

1192
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,319
add default tracker image so it will be

1193
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,319
an invisible image will be adding in the

1194
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,839
back and it will be

1195
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,799
acting as a tracker image we can add a

1196
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,799
custom tracker image if we are adding

1197
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,480
any

1198
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,680
images like a signature or company logo

1199
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,160
anything

1200
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,760
we can make that as a tracker image we

1201
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,520
don't need to add additional

1202
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,400
default tracker image invisible image

1203
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,280
here

1204
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,559
let me we can add a custom tracker image

1205
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,040
we have some format files here this is a

1206
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,640
company logo

1207
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,520
so maybe we can add this in the bottom

1208
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,720
of the mailbody

1209
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,240
to act as a tracker image

1210
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,480
so is said that the logo is so big let's

1211
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:17,839
make it smaller

1212
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,359
thus we created a fishing male body

1213
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,839
we can provide some name here for the

1214
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,400
template

1215
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,920
there is an email subject we may submit

1216
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,160
like this it's a congrats mail or

1217
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,520
acquisition mail

1218
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,119
a gift to me like for maybe we can

1219
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,839
create a subject like a congrats

1220
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,559
now let's save this mail body if you

1221
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,839
want to add any

1222
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,440
attachments we can add here

1223
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,160
maybe we can for the demo we can add

1224
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,319
some random attachment here

1225
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,680
like this is my favorite cache picture

1226
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,599
let me add this so it's attached

1227
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:27,680
here now we are saving this

1228
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,640
for email template is already created it

1229
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,400
looks like we already created

1230
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,160
everything before starting mail campaign

1231
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,359
now let's go and directly create a mail

1232
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,839
campaign

1233
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,720
click new mail campaign we

1234
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,920
provide some name like

1235
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,559
first campaign

1236
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,319
and we have a user group created here

1237
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,520
and mail template

1238
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,040
and mail sender we created launch time

1239
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,920
is here

1240
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,040
so this is basically the present time if

1241
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,359
we

1242
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,839
want to schedule to future time let's

1243
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,079
change here

1244
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,119
and if we set present time or any past

1245
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:17,680
time

1246
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,480
the mail camera will start immediately

1247
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,079
for now for this demo

1248
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,119
i'm starting mailchimp immediately so

1249
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,280
just click activated email campaign

1250
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,480
automatically for that

1251
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,440
if i save this the campaign will start

1252
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,640
automatically

1253
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,839
and we have one field here message

1254
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:36,559
interval

1255
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,799
so this is the interval between sending

1256
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:39,920
each mails

1257
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,400
we can either create a random mail

1258
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,040
interval

1259
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,240
or constant bill interval here assume

1260
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,520
that

1261
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,880
we are sending email to a company having

1262
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,480
a large number of

1263
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,640
employees like a hundred four thousand

1264
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,480
employees if we send a mail

1265
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,520
in a bulk it can be get blocked at their

1266
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,000
end they will they can have some

1267
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,280
security mechanism

1268
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,040
to detect unusual

1269
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,000
emails and block them for me send a

1270
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,839
message interval may be a random

1271
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:12,559
interval

1272
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,960
it will the mail plug will looks like a

1273
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,040
usual mail flow

1274
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,160
so for now i'm just setting a constant

1275
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,078
10 second mail interval

1276
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,599
so next there's a

1277
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,319
mail pale retry we no need to

1278
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,200
change this and same if the fishing

1279
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,480
sniper fish paste

1280
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,960
failed to send them here it will retry

1281
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,160
for the account is

1282
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,359
set here by default we are selecting the

1283
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,559
two itself

1284
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,839
let's click save note that if we

1285
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,000
click save the mail cabin will start

1286
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,400
immediately

1287
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,480
so as mentioned there is a

1288
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,359
scheduled the message of the shed the

1289
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,040
old time is in past this will

1290
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,400
start that cabin immediately so also

1291
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,000
this or not this will delete the

1292
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,359
previous results of this cabin

1293
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,640
if we are running this cabin again if

1294
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,440
there is any

1295
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,480
previous record recordings uh

1296
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,760
those data will be deleted so

1297
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,520
but we don't need to consider that this

1298
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,839
is our first campaign here

1299
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:29,839
let's click save

1300
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,240
we can see the status will shape the old

1301
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,839
let's refresh see we can see

1302
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:41,040
fishing cam and is in progress as well

1303
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,040
as mail sending status is in progress

1304
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,079
let's check the report

1305
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,240
we can see two out of five emails has

1306
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,400
been sent already

1307
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,680
within this time let's

1308
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,960
wait few more seconds so all

1309
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,799
emails will be sent successfully

1310
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:11,839
for mail has been sent

1311
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,319
so all this has been sent just

1312
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:25,839
click the windows dashboard once again

1313
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,040
so the mail sending is completed already

1314
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,640
for you what the file me mail sas

1315
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,319
missing we can see that

1316
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,839
mail sending timeline is all uh

1317
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,760
the spacing between them are constant

1318
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,119
because we

1319
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,480
sell 10 second interval between

1320
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,200
our emails

1321
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,359
so here is the overview

1322
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,960
email send an email open email replied

1323
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,480
we can't see anything any data here now

1324
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,000
let's open one of the email accounts of

1325
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,520
the target employee

1326
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:21,839
and let's see how the email looks like

1327
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,200
for example let's open bella's mail

1328
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,839
account

1329
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,079
you can see the mail has been received

1330
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,760
here

1331
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,400
we are opening this mail so it looks

1332
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,200
like it

1333
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,599
the our logo is not loaded here

1334
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,319
a protection like here to protect your

1335
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,680
privacy remote for

1336
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,720
up to be blocked it's just an email to

1337
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,520
track this

1338
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,880
work as per this email client

1339
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,280
we need to allow this

1340
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,599
so we can see the image loaded our track

1341
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,359
is basically our tracker image

1342
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,880
now it should be recorded in the snap

1343
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,760
permission

1344
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,680
such that the image has been opened at

1345
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,839
this time

1346
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,799
can check this here

1347
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,440
see we can see one mail account is four

1348
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,720
point

1349
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,319
seven of mail account is opened here

1350
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,920
and similarly we are

1351
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,400
clicking this reward portal assume that

1352
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,000
there is some

1353
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,839
will uh didn't realize this is a fish

1354
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:42,078
email and she is clicking on this

1355
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,880
link

1356
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,200
before she got the demo company login

1357
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,319
page she

1358
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:59,119
submitting the her email address here

1359
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,480
she submitted her personal gmail address

1360
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,760
buffered um typing one two three

1361
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,000
four five six and

1362
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,839
she's logging in

1363
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,200
so it's a default chrome notification

1364
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,760
because it basically detects a offer to

1365
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,520
submit a days

1366
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,200
and we just ignore this

1367
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,759
uh she's formatting her name here

1368
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,680
and she's a white color and for the

1369
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,559
round term

1370
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:41,839
i'm something 111

1371
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,559
so he is submitting this

1372
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,799
basically you can see there is a cid

1373
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,640
field

1374
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,599
this is specific to this user if we open

1375
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:56,240
another

1376
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,079
account the cd will be different

1377
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:03,520
for basically this track the user who

1378
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,559
clicked this

1379
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,880
website who opened this website and who

1380
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,720
hopefully the data

1381
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,200
now we want to see the data in the

1382
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,480
sniper page

1383
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,760
this is a email camera dashboard so we

1384
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,319
need

1385
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,839
both dashboard here web and email

1386
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,760
to see the result let's check this

1387
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,720
this is our mail cabin we created this

1388
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,680
tracker we initially created

1389
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,880
so we select all this

1390
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,880
this is the combined dashboard we can

1391
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,119
see the overall details here

1392
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:38,660
we have created two

1393
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,400
[Music]

1394
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,520
campaigns and two pages one is page

1395
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,119
visit we hope there is an option to see

1396
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,079
the page list

1397
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,480
entries here the page is opened it will

1398
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,559
record here if there is information

1399
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,000
they will record here basically this

1400
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,960
looks like

1401
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,480
a meter time data we opened we send our

1402
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,400
mail

1403
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,720
this is our mail champion after some

1404
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,799
time the village opened the mail

1405
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:09,760
and she took the link she opened the

1406
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,480
website

1407
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,000
then she submitted the attack so we can

1408
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,760
see the

1409
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,880
dashboard here for both the email and

1410
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,599
the web

1411
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,039
details here we can see the combined

1412
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,240
result

1413
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,000
as a tableau form it's a wr form

1414
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,160
and we can see the whole emails here

1415
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,480
currently only bella has opened a mail

1416
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,520
so we can see the time public id

1417
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,720
and time she submitted and

1418
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,760
submitted or not the form data

1419
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,680
everything can be seen here

1420
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,119
and let me open one more mail account

1421
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:52,880
maybe you would like to see the

1422
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,640
gmail account i'm opening

1423
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:01,839
gmail account here like a victim

1424
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,760
so i hope we have received a phishing

1425
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,240
mail here

1426
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,319
by default gmail will load the

1427
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,839
email in our tracking image

1428
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,280
in its backend proxy so we can

1429
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,000
easily identify that this email is open

1430
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,720
or not

1431
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,160
just refresh this

1432
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,280
we see two email accounts has been

1433
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,640
opened you can see

1434
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,480
seven is gmail accord so we identified

1435
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,119
the second

1436
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,480
gmail account is offered and now

1437
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,799
let's assume uh this account

1438
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,760
uh the account user this is a suspicious

1439
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,039
email and

1440
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,240
or this account user need to

1441
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,359
know more details about this email so

1442
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,599
the usually some sending a mail back to

1443
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,720
the center

1444
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:03,440
yo who are you

1445
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,039
so you start sending mail back to the

1446
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,200
ceo's mail account

1447
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,160
so it looks like the user of dictator

1448
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,839
this is a suspicious email

1449
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,120
and this one needs to know more details

1450
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,719
let's wait few minutes

1451
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,319
to be reached here it will take a few

1452
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,880
minutes to

1453
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,000
receive in the cs mailbox like email

1454
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,359
replied is nothing

1455
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:39,839
let's wait few more seconds

1456
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,279
in the meantime i will open this mail

1457
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,000
account

1458
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,479
and click this link

1459
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,759
so we can see this id here

1460
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,839
if we check the last email account this

1461
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:10,080
is

1462
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,960
right id so this basically means the

1463
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,238
account

1464
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:17,120
both this email account are tracking

1465
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,000
separately

1466
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,640
if you want this id value so we don't

1467
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,238
need the forget

1468
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,600
to append the cid value in the

1469
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,560
url field when we create a mail body

1470
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,920
we are not submitting anything here just

1471
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,560
clocks

1472
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,359
just close this

1473
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,279
and we are refreshing this

1474
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,040
so after some time we have

1475
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,679
received email here also we open this

1476
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:48,640
open the email

1477
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,000
stock it here let's see what the user

1478
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,839
replied here

1479
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,199
we don't see a field here to see the

1480
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:01,199
reply mail so just click this

1481
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:05,120
um here we can select a

1482
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,159
table in the mail campaign we

1483
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,600
check mail reply so this means i will to

1484
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,520
show them whether mail is replayed or

1485
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,239
not

1486
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:19,440
you can add one more column will reply

1487
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,199
content so we can see that we will play

1488
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,560
content here

1489
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,800
so before that let me explain this table

1490
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,960
that appeared once again

1491
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,400
this person claims that you support to

1492
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,520
submit a multiple data if we want to see

1493
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,320
all data

1494
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,880
we select all entries if you want to see

1495
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,199
the first one only just click this

1496
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:45,839
now we selected main reply click apply

1497
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,080
so this is a table here um

1498
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,920
see that may reply content

1499
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,000
based on our table selected click on

1500
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,800
view so we can see our main reply here

1501
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:07,280
so if we send one more reply here

1502
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,559
just like test

1503
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,600
after some time when the email reaches

1504
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,960
here we can see the second mail here

1505
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:27,840
just wait some more time

1506
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,840
so

1507
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,800
we can also check the mail account

1508
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:55,840
of the ceo user

1509
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,520
we can see the mail who our initial meal

1510
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,120
has been received here refresh

1511
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,400
so we have received the second test mail

1512
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:12,960
account

1513
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,280
also let's check this in sniper fish

1514
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,920
so first meal is here second replacement

1515
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:24,719
is here

1516
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,199
so we can also track like this the

1517
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,120
replace we received

1518
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,400
in our fishing meal

1519
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,560
so i hope everyone understood how

1520
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,280
we can create a web and email basically

1521
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,600
fishing campaign

1522
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,400
we i have shown you the email camera

1523
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,280
dashboard

1524
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,640
uh with mail campaign dashboard

1525
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,800
so if we want to see the web tracker

1526
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,000
data

1527
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,840
alone we can select this and click on

1528
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,400
the report

1529
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,560
we can see the all details here client

1530
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,840
id public a

1531
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,760
private ip time is displayed here

1532
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,960
so we

1533
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,640
can separately see the web record

1534
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,280
the web page activities alone here if we

1535
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,000
need that and if we want to see the

1536
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,320
email activity alone here we go to this

1537
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,840
tab

1538
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,520
and if we want to see both email and

1539
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,560
web details combined

1540
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,600
let's open this down

1541
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,520
i will show you how we can export the

1542
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,159
report here

1543
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:43,520
so we have that data here

1544
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,800
basically the tables of the

1545
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,080
selected fields and its values if

1546
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,800
we are exporting if we want to add

1547
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,080
additional fields

1548
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,600
just click on settings we if we click

1549
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,520
all entries

1550
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,560
all entries will be added

1551
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,400
for for now we have only performed

1552
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,760
one action like if we are

1553
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,880
in once again it should be tracked here

1554
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,120
so we have multiple entries here

1555
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,280
you can see two times the account is

1556
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,159
4.42 times that

1557
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:31,199
ibr does extract two times the

1558
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,080
first visit

1559
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,280
so now we are going to export this

1560
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:43,040
just click on export we

1561
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:47,360
provide some file name

1562
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,480
we are exporting the gambian result here

1563
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,760
just select export type

1564
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,920
for now i'm selecting sls

1565
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,880
here we can see the old data here as we

1566
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,199
saw in the snap publish dashboard

1567
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:21,760
so this is basically how sniper works

1568
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,040
for webbing email based campaign

1569
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,000
there are some additional features i

1570
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,520
would like to

1571
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,560
familiarize with you for example

1572
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,760
if the company that if you are sending a

1573
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,520
mail cab into a fishing

1574
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,960
company and they need a separate

1575
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,719
and they have a specific time zone

1576
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,560
format we can just

1577
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,440
change here based on their requirement

1578
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,760
we have multiple time zone format

1579
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,120
for example they don't want to see the

1580
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,320
time just click on display format

1581
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,840
just based on this format so

1582
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,880
time will all data will be recorded

1583
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,600
in this form basically it's not

1584
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,800
recording is

1585
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
actually displaying in the sniper

1586
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,040
version

1587
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,520
so whenever you need a different format

1588
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,320
just

1589
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,480
like this for example i'm selecting this

1590
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,718
one

1591
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:22,480
this form uh based on this

1592
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,520
the timestamp will be shown like this

1593
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,280
just click save now let's go back to

1594
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,320
email campaign dashboard

1595
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,400
now we are selecting the campaign

1596
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,719
we can see the start time is like this

1597
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:41,360
and

1598
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,560
all formats are changed if we export

1599
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,080
the report that timestamp will be

1600
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,800
like this so we have some advanced

1601
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,320
custom effects in this

1602
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,510
timestamp format also and

1603
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,120
[Music]

1604
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,760
this is basic parking of web and email

1605
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,840
based

1606
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,000
campaign as mentioned

1607
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,840
initially there are some additional

1608
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,199
modules added in the sniper base

1609
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,679
these are mainly for supporting us to

1610
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:12,400
perform this

1611
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,520
fishing cabin easily let's see what are

1612
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,520
these

1613
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,719
let's go to homepage we can see the

1614
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,159
cabin we created initially there's a

1615
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,040
one mail cabin we created and the web

1616
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,400
tracker we created

1617
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,040
and there is no symbol tracker let's see

1618
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:31,440
what

1619
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,719
this symbol tracker is you can go to

1620
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,199
simple tracker

1621
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,360
simple track basically means as the name

1622
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,120
indicates a

1623
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,239
single tracker code that can be used in

1624
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:44,640
the

1625
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,320
phishing email or any website

1626
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:52,320
you are sending or you are hosting

1627
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:56,640
so this is basically an image

1628
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,440
that you can add in that mail body or

1629
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,360
any website pages

1630
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,840
when the page is open or the mail is

1631
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,640
opened

1632
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,480
this will drag here if you want to track

1633
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,320
if you want to quickly track a single

1634
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,840
mail you can use this

1635
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,679
now i'm not actually creating a mail

1636
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:18,320
with this

1637
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,440
let's see how this works i'm creating a

1638
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:27,120
simple tracker

1639
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:31,040
a name just tracker one click on

1640
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:35,520
save the tracker is created

1641
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,760
now

1642
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,159
i'm copying this i copy this

1643
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,560
this is the image html image

1644
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,000
i'm just copying this

1645
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,800
image only

1646
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,520
you can start this tracker

1647
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,080
now i'm opening a new tab and

1648
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,000
let me add one dummy value one one two

1649
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,159
two

1650
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:20,159
so it's a hidden image with a

1651
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,760
one dx image basically if you add

1652
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,040
any email body or website

1653
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,719
it will not be visible now i have opened

1654
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:31,600
this image

1655
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,159
it should have tracked in the backend

1656
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:37,839
let's see

1657
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:43,520
checking for a report you can see that

1658
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,840
the image is open this client id

1659
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,480
we have ordered in the end of the url as

1660
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,840
a public ip milk

1661
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,640
and basically it's a simple try class

1662
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,020
that name indicates

1663
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,880
[Music]

1664
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,199
now let's see the other modules it's

1665
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,480
basically payload

1666
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,320
sniper host at present we have

1667
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,600
not really added this in github we are

1668
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,199
really testing this

1669
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,880
in our in our

1670
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,920
environment once we see that is really

1671
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,639
working

1672
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,360
and we will put back to our github

1673
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,120
repository

1674
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,960
let's see first payload payloads is

1675
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,320
payloads are actually for example

1676
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,800
if we are sending an email we need to

1677
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,639
add some

1678
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:38,320
um payloads like exe files

1679
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,520
on csv files like it will be downloaded

1680
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,239
at the client

1681
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,960
side and when the client click on that

1682
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,679
we will be

1683
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,239
getting a reverse connection in that

1684
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,360
case

1685
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,040
these are some tested methods

1686
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,520
as name indicator is referred to b and

1687
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,560
dll this means that

1688
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,760
when we create a exe

1689
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,440
or any dll binary it will execute in the

1690
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,679
memory and it will not be attract

1691
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:11,440
and project by review a b

1692
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,960
this is an easy method easy

1693
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,920
option i have added in the sniper page

1694
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,960
let's see how we can create this

1695
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,719
we can easily use the mf we know

1696
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,639
to create a reversal if we create

1697
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,040
a reversal using ms of vm it will

1698
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,480
you are definitely sure it will be

1699
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,440
detected by almost all antivirus

1700
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,159
but what we are doing here is we are

1701
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,639
creating a dll or exe reverse shell

1702
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:43,120
using

1703
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,480
amazon vm and if we upload this into

1704
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,400
our cipher page it will convert that

1705
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,600
into a reflective

1706
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,719
dll or p correspondingly so

1707
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,520
if we use any partial commands

1708
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,199
to secure this dll in the

1709
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,600
target victim machine it will be

1710
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,800
executed without

1711
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,000
detecting an av

1712
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,040
you can see the subway dll uh binaries

1713
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,880
we get in that

1714
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:18,159
sniper fish main website demo website

1715
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:21,120
uh we are not really going to create dms

1716
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,080
of we know

1717
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,360
um payload here and uploading here

1718
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,560
and just i'm just just familiarizing all

1719
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,440
this with you

1720
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:33,440
fully and similarly we have one more

1721
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,800
viewer like a

1722
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,520
host sniper host it's basically nothing

1723
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,719
but hosting

1724
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,920
any payloads any files anything that can

1725
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,600
be usually

1726
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,159
we are using with a sniper version for

1727
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:46,880
example

1728
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:52,159
if we are hosting any files

1729
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:55,440
if we want to upload uh

1730
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,600
some payloads and we are uploading here

1731
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,560
and we can

1732
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,480
this will create a direct download link

1733
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,639
and you can directly send that into

1734
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,000
phishing mail

1735
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,239
you don't need to depend on anything but

1736
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:09,040
website

1737
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:13,679
to upload and get a direct download link

1738
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,679
additionally if you are uploading any

1739
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:16,800
files here

1740
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,080
we can also make a

1741
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,960
selected corresponding type header for

1742
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,800
example if you are

1743
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,719
uploading a test playing test file we

1744
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:28,880
went there that plain text

1745
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,000
link you can use the file here

1746
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,040
and test by for example if we

1747
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,880
are noi if you want to

1748
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,920
perform a quick uh

1749
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,800
spear spacing attack using a plane html

1750
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,280
file

1751
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,560
and you don't have any option to

1752
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,880
host the phishing website you can select

1753
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,840
the

1754
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,960
testable html and upload here directly

1755
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,000
so it will generate a download link you

1756
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,400
can

1757
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,679
send that to the victim so

1758
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,040
the html page will be displayed

1759
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,320
in the the website sorry in the web

1760
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,280
browser itself

1761
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,280
so you don't need to depend on any third

1762
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,199
party hosting this is basically

1763
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,440
free support option actually we don't

1764
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,840
really host here because this is

1765
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,679
presently only support one

1766
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:25,520
html page if you want to create a real

1767
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,080
working scenario like this like the one

1768
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,360
i demonstrated

1769
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,800
we are hosting in a separately

1770
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:38,719
additional let me show you plain text

1771
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,560
this is similar to files in here we are

1772
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,719
hosting a plain test data

1773
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,920
for example a bb

1774
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,400
you type something type something and

1775
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,440
give some name

1776
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,639
test and

1777
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:58,320
we can select a encryption or encoding

1778
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,800
algorithm

1779
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,440
this is a corresponding basis t4 for

1780
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,239
this

1781
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:07,440
and if we select additional one base 32

1782
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:12,159
generate a base 32 after

1783
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:15,520
creating a basis t4 of this value

1784
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,120
so basically this is a base 30

1785
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,880
to off basis value of this asbb

1786
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,000
so this is a cute encryption

1787
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,320
option we have provided here if you are

1788
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,159
encrypting any payloads

1789
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:34,239
if that is used in the phishing campaign

1790
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,320
for example the scenario is like this we

1791
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,440
have a powershell

1792
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,719
script that is useful to download our

1793
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,840
encrypted

1794
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,320
payload and execute in the victims

1795
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,679
machine

1796
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:49,760
and for that we can add our payload here

1797
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,280
it will

1798
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,280
generate the encrypted formula or

1799
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,040
encoded form here

1800
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,040
corresponding to the encoding or

1801
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,520
encryption algorithm we chose

1802
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,960
and we can select the output

1803
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,360
file format it can be a plain text file

1804
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,120
usually

1805
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,560
um we select content type header

1806
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,480
and then we click save

1807
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:19,440
[Music]

1808
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,719
we have generated link here

1809
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,679
just copy this

1810
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,639
before we get a direct link for this

1811
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,639
encoded

1812
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:36,239
payload like this we can use this

1813
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,679
angled payload if we have a scenario

1814
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,520
we need to use that in a phishing

1815
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,040
campaign payloads

1816
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,120
under secured in a client site on the

1817
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,239
written site

1818
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:50,639
we can use this method

1819
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,679
so this is basically we are currently

1820
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,880
developing uh trying to make improve

1821
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,440
this and later we will be adding in the

1822
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,839
github

1823
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,880
i think this is we can

1824
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,400
finalize that demo here um

1825
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,040
we have explained almost all features of

1826
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,000
the sniper page

1827
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,719
if you want to feed this sniper fish

1828
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,000
just go to

1829
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,880
and if you want to see how the interface

1830
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,440
looks like

1831
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:28,080
and everything you can go to our website

1832
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,080
sniperfishfast.com

1833
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,000
click on demo we have hostess

1834
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,360
demo snipers here for a demo login

1835
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,879
you can see

1836
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,120
how the sniper page looks like

1837
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:53,520
and now

1838
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:57,440
we can go to next question

1839
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,719
now we are back to our flight these are

1840
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:01,040
the

1841
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,239
future activities we plan to do with the

1842
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,880
fishing toolkit sniper fish the first

1843
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,480
one is a shareable link of

1844
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,800
dashboard suppose you are performing the

1845
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,800
efficient campaign for a client

1846
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,679
and you want to show them how the cabin

1847
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:16,800
is in progress

1848
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,560
then you can create a link of the

1849
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,800
campaign dashboard and send to them

1850
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,000
so they will get the updated idea about

1851
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,960
how the campaign is pro cabin is

1852
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,719
progressing

1853
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:32,080
uh useful geolocation mapping is like

1854
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,080
we are protein the user location in the

1855
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,199
very map

1856
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:39,759
for example if the user opens a mailbox

1857
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,679
and he opens the fishing email we will

1858
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,639
get track so we can track the user based

1859
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:48,320
on their ip

1860
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,400
and we can plot their geo location based

1861
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,600
on that

1862
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,920
and the fish will set ground up with the

1863
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:54,800
preview and

1864
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,120
hosting option currently we don't have

1865
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,960
it we do not have a

1866
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,120
website corner module in the phishing

1867
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,159
toolkit

1868
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:05,280
we will be adding that phone

1869
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,080
and binary periods encoders suppose if

1870
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,280
you are

1871
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,560
sending phishing email with the payloads

1872
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,840
binary payloads

1873
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,000
you can have the option to encode them

1874
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,920
with the help of sniper fish

1875
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,360
we can convert to any other format or

1876
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,760
using a plain text format using the

1877
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,920
payload encoders

1878
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,600
and you can use that along with the

1879
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,199
efficient camera

1880
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:31,760
uh next one is more payloads and modules

1881
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,159
will be adding more payloads and more

1882
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:35,280
value

1883
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,560
more encoders phone

1884
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,000
and api it will be

1885
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,760
developing an api for so that if you

1886
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,239
have any

1887
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,480
toolkit or any software that you want to

1888
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,159
integrate with the sniper page you can

1889
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,400
use that

1890
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,560
and next one is based on your suggestion

1891
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,400
if you have any

1892
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,400
feedback or any new module suggestion
