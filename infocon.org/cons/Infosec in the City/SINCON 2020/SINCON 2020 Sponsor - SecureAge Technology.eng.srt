this is your data

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,559
it can be all sorts of great things like

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,160
a business presentation

entire backend database

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,480
it could be the source code for the next

your data needs to be protected most

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,320
simply get full disk encryption to

12

protect their hardware

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,519
and call it a day but there are far

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,600
worse dangers to your data today than

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,960
just a lost drive

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,399
or a stolen computer especially while in

17

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,440
by having every file in a naturally

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800

here's how it works every file is

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,280
encrypted

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280

transferred to your system

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
the encryption persists even when it's

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,400
moved to another drive

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640

fully transparent to its intended users

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,479
a small icon is all you see on every

encrypted file

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
all that's needed to open it is a double

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,600
click just like always

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
there's zero change in user and

turn to disk encryption

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
an encrypted disk is essentially a

177
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,080
container that safely encrypts

178
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,720
every file that goes inside while most

179
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
turn to full disk encryption

180
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
it's limited in size by hardware and

181
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
ties data to one

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
device in a single user virtual volume

183
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,039
encryption on the other hand makes a

184
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,600
container of any size that can be stored

185
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,080
anywhere from physical media network

186
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,880
storage

187
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,199
or even the cloud and while encrypted

188
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,000
volumes can

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
be shared they typically rely on

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,280
passwords

191
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,720
and that can be incredibly vulnerable

192
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
secureage secure disk easily lets you

193
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,080
create

194
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,319
virtual encrypted volumes that can be

195
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,880
shared without clunky passwords

196
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,199
it uses powerful public key encryption

197
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
so that only the people you trust

198
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,720
can open interact and modify files

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,880
no matter where they are without leaving

200
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,199
a clue to others of what's inside

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,000
you

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,520
but did you know that there are hundreds

214
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
of thousands of malware and viruses

215
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,560
released daily

216
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
and only 10 percent are detected by

217
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,720
antiviruses within the first week

218
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,120
scary right it's okay bouncer

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,879
not even you can protect us from the

220
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,479
other 90 percent

221
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,720
but secure a plus can secure a plus is

and get this it's absolutely free

227
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
yep more than 10 antiviruses for less

228
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,479
than a dog biscuit

229
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,680
it's also fast incredibly fast

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,800
why well all of these antiviruses live

231
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
in the cloud

232
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,599
so your computer won't have to process

233
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
locally

234
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,240
no bouncer not that type of cloud silly

235
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,199
dog

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
it's so fast that you get a full system

237
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,279
scan from all of these anti-viruses

238
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,919
in less than a minute and remember those

239
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
pesky untrusted apps that take it upon

240
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
themselves to automatically run without

241
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,200
your permission

242
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,279
secure a plus prevents that from

243
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,120
happening
