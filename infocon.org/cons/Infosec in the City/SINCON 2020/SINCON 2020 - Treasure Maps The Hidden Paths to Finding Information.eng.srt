1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,879
hi everyone it's alicia again

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,400
our next stop will be presented by

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,559
terence tan he'll be sharing with you

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,000
about the basics of open source

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,880
intelligence

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
including google docking and showdown

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
let's give him a warm welcome

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,760
hello everyone my name is terence and

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,359
today we'll be talking about treasure

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:21,920
maps

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
and which is the hidden paths to finding

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,439
information

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
so what is this whole workshop is going

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400
to be about today we're going to be

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,159
talking more or less about

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,600
open source intelligence or osint

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
and um you know these are informations

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,079
that are all available publicly in the

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,200
public domain

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
you don't need to go into the what the

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,559
hidden uh dark web

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
or what or what not or maybe even some

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,680
paywalls to

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,160
access such data these data are all

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
going to be publicly available data

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
and therefore they are like

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,320
you know information that's out there on

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,559
the

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
treasure map but yet still hidden from

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,600
plain view

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,239
so you might have actually seen them but

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,640
you don't

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
even know that they exist

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
so before i begin i'd like to make a

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,799
disclosure here is that

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,640
this workshop is meant to be for

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,400
educational and training purposes

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,439
only please please do not use any of

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
these materials from this session for

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,439
any

41
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,640
illegal purposes now

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
just a quick background about myself uh

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,439
i actually graduated from nus

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,400
commuting in information security just

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,880
last

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,280
earlier this year sorry and i'm actually

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,400
an alumni for

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,040
from the noc israel program so i

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
actually went to israel last year

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,840
uh as well um right now i'm actually an

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,479
engineer

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,240
and a semiconductor company called

53
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,000
micron uh not sure if

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
you guys are familiar with it i'll

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,119
actually do memory chip

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,119
from a lot of the products that you guys

57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,360
might have

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
uh personally i believe that cyber

59
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,719
security is actually everyone's

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,159
responsibility

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,240
and therefore i actually love to share

62
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,360
with everyone

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
everyday tips about how to keep yourself

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,119
safe

65
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
on a day-to-day basis so

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
in today's workshop we'll actually be

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,800
covering os int

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
and what are the key techniques that you

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,400
learned is

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,160
you'll be learning how to do google

71
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,920
docking you'll be

72
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
learning about default passwords you'll

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
be learning about exif

74
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
and most importantly you'll be learning

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,560
about shodan

76
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
so first up what is os

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
int for some of you who might not be

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,160
aware

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,640
osint actually is open source

80
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,599
intelligence

81
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
whereby we use publicly available

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,959
information

83
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,239
um to better understand your target and

84
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,360
uh the real this is actually very

85
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,319
important

86
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,840
because in this pandemic this clovic 19

87
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,640
pandemic

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
everyone around uh is actually working

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,599
from starting to work from home more and

90
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
more often and

91
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,440
this trend seems to be continuing you

92
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
see look at google look at facebook all

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
the big uh forms

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
they're actually encouraging more of

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,519
their employees to be working from home

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,800
uh even after the pen

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
uh up even after we move on to phase

98
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,239
three

99
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,200
so what this effectively means is that

100
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
the world is relying more and more about

101
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
on the

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,159
public infrastructure for the internet

103
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,319
for information exchange

104
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,599
less so uh on the uh

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,560
traditional corporate infrastructure uh

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
intranet infrastructure

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
so this actually means that there are

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
more and more opportunities for

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
employees to actually

110
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,120
leave tbits of uh keep about for target

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
employees to actually leave tea bits and

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,920
uh little bread crumbs around for you to

113
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,959
actually pick up

114
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,080
pick up and uh actually do a proper

115
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
even better analysis on your target

116
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,280
before you actually do an attack on them

117
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
as such because of this kind of uh

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,640
behavior this kind of

119
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
trends that we are looking at in the

120
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,480
whole industry as a whole uh

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
os int will only become more and more

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
useful

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,840
as time goes by

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,639
so let's start off with looking at this

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,000
simple case study

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
this hack ip camera incident uh

127
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,479
as you can see it's not only in

128
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
singapore we have korea

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,960
uh taiwan and so so for a couple of

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,680
countries that are more developed more

131
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
interconnected we have more cameras that

132
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,120
we want to um

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,160
protect ourselves as uh with but at the

134
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,800
same time

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
like a double you sort some really

136
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,880
unscrupulous people actually are using

137
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,240
uh

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
our insecurity here against us and

139
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
making

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,720
us even less secure um in this

141
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
particular case as you can see

142
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
uh all this you know peeping at uh

143
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,440
the opposite gender or even the same

144
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,520
gender doing their own things

145
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,039
uh it's i'm not sure how to put it but

146
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,280
it is becoming more and more prevalent

147
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,840
so bringing it closer to home uh in

148
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,560
singapore

149
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
you know this article was actually uh

150
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
reported in

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,919
back in october i think that's about two

152
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,440
months ago

153
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,840
uh the news article actually showed uh

154
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,639
reported that

155
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
ip cameras are being hacked and their

156
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,560
contents are being leaked and sold

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,759
online

158
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,680
so uh so you know we buy

159
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,199
these cameras you know to protect

160
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
ourselves when we are uh

161
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,080
all running our things at home uh or

162
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
maybe just the morning to our pets at

163
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,080
home

164
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,919
uh when we're not at home but now with

165
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,199
everybody working more and more from

166
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,000
home

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
we tend to forget that we have these

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
little cameras there and

169
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,840
this is such a big problem because these

170
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,320
reports

171
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,160
these hackers reportedly have over three

172
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,759
terabytes of uh

173
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,960
contents that they have actually

174
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,800
recorded from all these cctvs

175
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,759
or ip cameras and they are even still

176
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
selling live access to these

177
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
systems which means that the systems

178
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,880
have not been patched

179
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,039
or and many of them still don't know

180
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,240
that they are being

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
watched by a creepy person on the other

182
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,560
side of the globe

183
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,199
and all of these are just available by

184
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,160
the sellers on the

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
discord channel uh they're just selling

186
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
it at usd 150

187
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,280
for access to of this content so i'm not

188
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,199
sure how you guys feel about it but

189
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
personally i feel very that this is a

190
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
very troubling thing

191
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
that you know people are watching you uh

192
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,720
without your permission

193
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,199
or without even you noticing it

194
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,840
and uh the whole part about this

195
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,639
workshop

196
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,960
we're going to look at how they actually

197
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,319
some of the methods that they actually

198
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,199
used

199
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,120
to actually acquire these footages

200
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,599
so first up we have here is the google

201
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,800
doc now

202
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
i remember uh back in a few years ago

203
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,919
uh one of my first non-school training

204
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,240
uh was at the

205
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,960
was with uh one of my non-school

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,160
training was uh

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
at a workshop called cyber defenders

208
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
and i remember the trainer from think

209
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,960
secure

210
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,280
his name was julian he actually just

211
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
kept telling us

212
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
always ask the oracle when we have

213
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,599
something uh

214
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,639
in when we have something in doubt and

215
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,360
i think this is very applicable here

216
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
because

217
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,680
google is pretty much one of the

218
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,840
most popular search engines so always

219
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,960
google google google

220
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,039
so why google google is one of the most

221
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,680
popular

222
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,240
search engines to find things online uh

223
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,120
most of the

224
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,520
people uh we will use google on a

225
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,759
day-to-day basis to search for

226
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,160
probably um where is this place what to

227
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,520
eat and whatnot

228
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,599
and there must be a reason why google is

229
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,039
so popular

230
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,280
and it's quite obvious because google

231
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
most of the time will likely give you a

232
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
result that you are looking for

233
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,240
and therefore even though google is

234
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,879
actually

235
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
uh actually has one of the largest

236
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,800
indexed uh

237
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,639
environments in the world database in

238
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,080
the world

239
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,199
and they only scrape the surface web as

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,759
you can see

241
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,319
the surface map is just a lay just a

242
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
little bit

243
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,319
of the whole internet infrastructure in

244
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,120
the world

245
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,479
but despite that it still can give us

246
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,760
a lot of information

247
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,799
so when we perform a google doc right

248
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,880
it's actually like a passive kind of

249
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,159
attack method because you're not

250
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,120
actively

251
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
telling the uh attack uh your victim or

252
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,959
target that hey look i'm attacking you

253
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,160
i'm probing about you

254
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
it's more like a uh stand back i'm going

255
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,720
through an intermediary so they don't

256
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
even know that you're looking up at them

257
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,720
but

258
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,760
even though it's a passive attack method

259
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
it can still tell us a lot of sensitive

260
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,959
information

261
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,800
and even about our website

262
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
vulnerabilities or even server

263
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,880
vulnerabilities

264
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,080
if you use it right so

265
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,880
that's it now let's take a look let's

266
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,440
explore some of the google docs

267
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
operators you know as part of their

268
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
services

269
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,920
google actually have a lot of operators

270
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,519
to help you to actually

271
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,160
help you to streamline uh your search

272
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,040
queries so as

273
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,560
for them to give you better search

274
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
results so some of the services like

275
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,880
uh google web i mean web search

276
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
the google images google news and so

277
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
forth they have

278
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
quite a few operators as you can see and

279
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
these operators each of them serve a

280
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,399
different purpose

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,480
so let's take an example take a look at

282
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,959
example

283
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,680
by using operators we can actually

284
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,959
streamline our searches

285
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,320
uh in this case so in this case

286
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
what am i actually looking for uh why am

287
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
i telling google that i'm looking for

288
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
i'm telling google that i'm looking for

289
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,079
a file type

290
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
that is that ends with pdf

291
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
and it has to have this keyword

292
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,360
confidential inside

293
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,640
and therefore uh looking into uh

294
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
by entering this in as you can see it

295
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,000
returns to me

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,240
all the pdfs that has the word

297
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,360
confidential insight

298
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
so that's it now it's your turn to

299
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
actually try it

300
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,240
uh for the purpose of this this workshop

301
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,079
i want you guys to actually open up your

302
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:32,560
google

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,760
uh google go to google.com and try

304
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,240
finding

305
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,560
a log that has a that has user names

306
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
inside you know

307
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,279
um and in this uh

308
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,079
in this case you should be using two

309
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,079
different search operators

310
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
i'll give you about two minutes to try

311
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
it and

312
00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:01,839
we'll come back in two minutes

313
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,079
all right if any one of you have any

314
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,519
questions about this uh

315
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,480
feel free to drop by uh discord and uh

316
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,079
put your questions there and i'll try my

317
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,560
best

318
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,839
to answer the questions

319
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
so

320
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,120
all right so um have you i hope you guys

321
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
have managed to find it

322
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,240
uh so for those of you who

323
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
are looking at uh trying to find out

324
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,920
what's the right answer well

325
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
this is the right answer we use the all

326
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,680
in text uh

327
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
operator to search for username and then

328
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
we look for the file type

329
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
log so all that so if you notice

330
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,880
actually uh in the previous slide

331
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
there is a one that is on text and

332
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,519
there's one in text

333
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,040
so what is the difference between the

334
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
two so

335
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,440
when you use all in text it will look

336
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
for

337
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,399
the what username or usernames

338
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
directly and you will not have like what

339
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
uh like for example

340
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
uh user if you type username it will

341
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,000
only return you username

342
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
all in the text if the text has uh user

343
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,480
names

344
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
then it will not return to you however

345
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,880
if you to use in text

346
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,000
then yes the the user names or or if you

347
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
put uh like

348
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,079
uh in front of our user names uh

349
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,440
all of these will appear because they're

350
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
just looking like a rejects um

351
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,399
as long as part of the

352
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,800
of the text matches your text you will

353
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,839
return to your result

354
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,079
so next up we have here is default

355
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,120
passwords well default passwords well

356
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
they are like the usernames passwords

357
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
and of course last but not least the

358
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
configurations

359
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
so default settings

360
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,680
i will say a lot of our hardware our

361
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,639
services

362
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,639
they come with a default username and

363
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,760
password

364
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
and even configurations of the box from

365
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
the factory

366
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,560
because um as an end product for

367
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
consumers

368
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,399
what these products have to be is they

369
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,760
have to be user friendly so

370
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,440
yeah most of the times uh plug and play

371
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,519
and what does this actually mean is that

372
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,639
users they don't

373
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
need to change anything they don't even

374
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,959
need to change the credentials they

375
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,160
don't even need to configure it just

376
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,880
plug it in

377
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,160
and it works therefore

378
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,639
what does this mean it means that you

379
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,600
know

380
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,199
most of the users they wouldn't change

381
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,600
anything

382
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
and this is compounded by the fact that

383
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,880
you know 59

384
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,040
of the people only use of people only

385
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,920
use

386
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,720
one just one set of password across all

387
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,160
the different services

388
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,880
and this you know by de facto becomes

389
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,959
their defect uh default result

390
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,959
uh sorry default password so for example

391
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,279
if you have a hotmail account uh using

392
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,519
uh

393
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,839
qwrtyuiop123 exclamation mark hashtag

394
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,079
it's a very long password it's a very it

395
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,160
can be considered a relatively strong

396
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,279
password

397
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,360
uh it matches most of the criterias but

398
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
i'm gonna use it for my facebook i'm

399
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,399
going to use it for my twitter i'm going

400
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,360
to use it for my

401
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
different form accounts i'm going to use

402
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,360
it for my discord password

403
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,680
what does this what's this going to be

404
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
it's going to be my default password

405
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,120
and when that happens

406
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
if one of the services that we use let's

407
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,199
say a forum that we go to

408
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,079
has been hacked then it what it

409
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,519
effectively means is that

410
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,079
the hacker now has your password to that

411
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:18,800
forum

412
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,480
he's gonna try your username and

413
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,959
and the password combination onto the

414
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,800
variety of services uh

415
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,320
that they have interest in and they

416
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
might even and it might

417
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,839
and if that's overlap like they are

418
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,519
interested in not only the forum they're

419
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,040
interested in facebook and

420
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,199
they try your username and password onto

421
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,279
facebook and it works

422
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,040
you know you are pretty much a

423
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,959
good game so

424
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,560
this also means that uh

425
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,120
with all these default configuration

426
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,680
default passwords and stuff

427
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,600
combined to get it together with google

428
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,120
doc that's now in a google doc you saw

429
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,519
logs with username and password

430
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,000
combine these two together what do we

431
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,799
actually get

432
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,079
at the end of the day we have

433
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,720
a whole password combination list that

434
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,559
is available for you to download i mean

435
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,760
not for you but

436
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
not for hackers to download access or

437
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,599
anyone who is interested and managed to

438
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,240
find this kind of database

439
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
now they have access to not only your

440
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,799
facebook not your form accounts

441
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,799
you have access to pretty much all of

442
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,799
your services that you use

443
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,720
and that can be a really scary thing

444
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
considering that

445
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
how much of uh how much of our personal

446
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,840
life

447
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,918
is now digitalized on the cloud

448
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,640
so that's it in when we uh so that's it

449
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
we can actually look into google to look

450
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,080
for default passwords

451
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,160
for different routers different services

452
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
and even uh you know

453
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,080
and even data we can even look for

454
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,440
password dumps

455
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
so as to find different kind of password

456
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,679
combinations that people are using

457
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,360
and you know this is probably one of the

458
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,799
things that they

459
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,280
uh attackers use once they've identified

460
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
uh

461
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
all of these services ip cameras that's

462
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,360
available online

463
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,120
now moving on from looking at scarring

464
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,559
on all these online things

465
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,760
another thing that is really pertinent

466
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,720
in uh finding uh bits and pieces of our

467
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,039
trills to find our treasure

468
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,240
it's within the exif data itself

469
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,720
access data is quite subtle because it

470
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,360
is there

471
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,760
but a lot of times we just tend to

472
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
forget about it

473
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
and when we do a whole proof of

474
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,919
information is available there

475
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,200
so let's take a look at what is exit

476
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,039
exchangeable image file format or exif

477
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
is actually a standard that's used by

478
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,799
cameras and softwares

479
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,919
and of course camera phones you know to

480
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,919
store data attributes about

481
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,039
your media files including images video

482
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,799
voice recording and so on so forth

483
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,080
well traditionally an exif actually

484
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,520
contain image

485
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,480
information from the photo attributes

486
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,880
that

487
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,120
and this includes iso shutter speed

488
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,160
aperture and

489
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,919
so on so forth and more importantly

490
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,960
uh in recent years when we take photos

491
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
using our phones

492
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,919
our gps coordinates are embedded

493
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,360
and and so on so forth and more

494
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
you know and because of because of that

495
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,640
uh

496
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
the exif is actually stored as

497
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
information in the image

498
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,440
so as a digital image uh you can store

499
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,760
additional digital information to it

500
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,960
it's just a

501
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
another route that you know attackers

502
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
can use to actually

503
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
load information secret information or

504
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,679
even malicious payload

505
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,600
so how are exif created or modified you

506
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,039
might ask

507
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,600
common tools uh that people use to

508
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,400
actually uh

509
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,600
modify uh modify or extract

510
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
full exit data is like using the access

511
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
tools that is available for free from

512
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,679
queen's u or even adobe photoshop

513
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,720
itself so you can actually download the

514
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,640
active tools from the qr code uh

515
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,360
on the screen here uh if you like but

516
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,919
for this

517
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,360
the purpose of this workshop we'll have

518
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
it very very simple um we won't be using

519
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,480
uh such tools uh but unfortunately uh

520
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,520
this workshop

521
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
uh we'll be talking we'll be teaching

522
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,200
you how to do it on the windows computer

523
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,440
itself uh they are always doing a mac

524
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,400
uh but i will not be touching it in this

525
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,280
workshop

526
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,640
so so now we'll just jump straight

527
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,919
into the uh into the

528
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,120
hands-on portion so exit this is

529
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,320
actually a simple active abstraction uh

530
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
if you guys have actually downloaded the

531
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
pre or workshop material which is

532
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
basically the

533
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,480
image file you should see the image

534
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,679
found with the name

535
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,120
treasure map special yep so this

536
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,600
map is actually very special uh i've

537
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,360
actually embedded extra information

538
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,919
inside

539
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,880
uh inside this maps uh i mean inside

540
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,520
this image

541
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,080
itself here we go here's the image

542
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,440
all right so um if you guys can

543
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,480
actually see the image here so

544
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
how do we actually extract uh standard

545
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,520
information

546
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,840
new you can't actually see it from the

547
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,440
photos app itself

548
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
but inside uh windows inside windows x

549
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,919
explorer itself

550
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,200
you can so let's take a look at how we

551
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,799
can access it

552
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,840
so now when we have the file actually uh

553
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
actually have the file here

554
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,039
we can actually just right click on it

555
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,039
onto it

556
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,240
scroll all the way down to properties

557
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,679
and here we have the properties

558
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,679
all right so in this properties when we

559
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,000
go to see the details

560
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,360
you can actually see that

561
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,959
you can actually see all the information

562
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,719
all right so um

563
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,159
so in this information uh from all of

564
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,760
these information are you able to

565
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,200
find uh some t-bits there

566
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
so first and foremost um one of the t

567
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,919
bits here that we have is the gps

568
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
coordinates the longitude and the

569
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,120
altitude

570
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,480
now i'd like you guys to try and pay

571
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,200
and retrieve out this gps logic to a

572
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,640
letter tune

573
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,120
and placing to google and let me know

574
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
what do you guys get

575
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,840
all right uh

576
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,440
okay i'll give you guys a little bit

577
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,919
more time to copy it and

578
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,720
paste into google and see uh where do

579
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,840
you think this photo was taken

580
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
all right so yes um some of you might

581
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,320
have guessed it right

582
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,640
this photo was supposedly taken at drool

583
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,880
however there's one issue here which is

584
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,799
it is not actually taken at drool this

585
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,760
photo was actually taken at raffle city

586
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,279
back in the 2018 uh uh infosec in the

587
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:55,980
city

588
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,200
[Music]

589
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,320
so that's one way or one example that we

590
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
have actually modified the file

591
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,960
and the second part of it is where is

592
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,559
the flag the flag is actually

593
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,360
it's actually just here under the camera

594
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,559
serial number

595
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,760
and this is actually a encoded uh

596
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,559
encoder string can any one of you

597
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:16,960
actually

598
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,159
solve this encoded string

599
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,080
i'll give you guys another minute to try

600
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,200
to retrieve it and

601
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
uh to see if any one of you can actually

602
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,279
find

603
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,840
uh tell me what does this string mean

604
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
so

605
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,200
all right we have some very really

606
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,440
brilliant people here

607
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,159
all right so actually this string was

608
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:04,960
encoded

609
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,240
in base 64.

610
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,960
right uh yeah okay that's the screen

611
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,799
yeah there you go this was actually

612
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,360
encoded in base64

613
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,880
and um see yeah

614
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,919
and when we deplete it decoded uh sorry

615
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,039
when we decoded it

616
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,159
we get the text the plain text which is

617
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,679
was this the treasure

618
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,679
right so if you have magic get this

619
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,840
right give yourself a pat on the back

620
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,760
all right now now that we have finished

621
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,400
exif

622
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
uh i hope you guys have actually looked

623
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
at uh so

624
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,120
actually i understood what exif is and

625
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,320
uh sometimes

626
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
uh how does exif come into place

627
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
that some people actually post

628
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,039
screenshots of their

629
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,080
uh screenshots of their webcams online

630
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
like you know hey look my dog is doing

631
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,200
this kind of activities

632
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,159
um look we're actually here and stuff

633
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,120
and then

634
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,279
they forget to scrub the excess data

635
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,559
from the

636
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,200
image itself and when the hackers get

637
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
their hands onto it

638
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,279
they can reverse they can try to run it

639
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,960
through the image algorithms

640
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,039
through google docking they'll try to

641
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,880
run through the

642
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,760
uh default services default uh port

643
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,799
numbers

644
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,159
of these uh systems and

645
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,559
through all this means they are made

646
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,000
they are able to find

647
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,120
your the cameras the ip cameras the ip

648
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,919
address for it

649
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,039
services for it but

650
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,279
this is a whole lot of trouble don't you

651
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,200
think

652
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,279
and the next topic that we have up here

653
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,400
helps to solve

654
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,120
all these problems i mean for the hacker

655
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,320
at least

656
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,000
show that showdown helps to uh make

657
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,960
finding uh

658
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,120
how it helps you to find your services

659
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,080
easily

660
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,360
what do i mean by that all right

661
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,559
so what is show that

662
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,720
shown is actually a search engine for

663
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
the internet of things

664
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
should i think of showdown like google

665
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
you know they crawl the internet

666
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,480
discover the internet for all of the

667
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
connected uh

668
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,480
devices and they collect jar they call

669
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
it the device fingerprints

670
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,279
and all of these are actually indexed

671
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:27,679
into

672
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
a single database like google so that

673
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,559
you can search through it

674
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,159
now what is show that again well

675
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,919
sorry uh why is jordan so useful

676
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,120
uh well traditional household items such

677
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,720
as refrigerators

678
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,919
even tvs and now as you can see security

679
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,159
cameras they're all connected to the

680
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,760
internet for convenience

681
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,880
you can look at your uh you can look at

682
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,000
your house camera

683
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,320
from all the way from your phone and say

684
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,039
hey look

685
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,120
um my dog is my dog is sleeping right

686
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,320
now oh

687
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,799
uh my mom uh my mom is my baby is in bed

688
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,360
um sleeping peacefully oh my baby is

689
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,720
crawling out or maybe

690
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,440
you know oh my mom is uh trying to get

691
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,320
off the bait

692
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,799
right now and i need someone someone to

693
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,159
help her

694
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,080
and so because of this convenience

695
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,640
everything is being hooked up online but

696
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,159
remember earlier on

697
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,120
that no uh so many people do not change

698
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,279
the default credentials

699
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,120
that's where the problem comes in comes

700
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,399
into play

701
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,880
i will explain that uh even more in a

702
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,159
short while

703
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,520
now in corporate environments or what we

704
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,000
also

705
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,919
what some of you might consider as an

706
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,679
industrial environment

707
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,919
manufacturing lines corporate

708
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,200
infrastructures they are all being

709
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,320
hooked up online

710
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,200
and in the case of uh manufacturing

711
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,760
lines

712
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,200
it is uh you know you know in case of a

713
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,880
metropolitan line

714
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,279
scada systems are the ones that's being

715
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,240
cooked online

716
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,360
so anyone uh who has

717
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,799
admin access to your system remotely

718
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,360
can technically do anything they want to

719
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,799
or manufacturing like

720
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,679
shut it down sabotage your plants and so

721
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,799
on so forth

722
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,720
so that's why uh understanding the use

723
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,919
of children

724
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,120
uh is or and more importantly

725
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,320
securing your infrastructure

726
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,520
or and your devices by changing the

727
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,679
passwords patching it regularly and so

728
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,240
forth

729
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,279
is paramount

730
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,240
so showdown actually uh

731
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,320
so showdown is actually is even more

732
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,640
useful uh these days because

733
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,760
modern devices like your ip cameras

734
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,159
are most likely going to be using the

735
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:54,880
standard

736
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,000
popular protocols like um in the case of

737
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,360
ip cameras again

738
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,919
they use are most of them use rtsp or

739
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,039
what we known as

740
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,000
real-time streaming protocol so you

741
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
don't only

742
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,279
need to use your vendor's application

743
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,880
you can use the private application like

744
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,320
vlc

745
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,520
and to make to name some uh to actually

746
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,480
access your video stream

747
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,000
and in many cases record them

748
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,480
furthermore if we're not talking about

749
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,000
ip cameras or

750
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,039
i mean some ip cameras they do uh they

751
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,919
even come with web interfaces

752
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,960
to actually help you to uh to actually

753
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
help you to perform remote management on

754
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
your uh

755
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,799
on your target system

756
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,360
oopsies right

757
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,720
so that's it um because they all come

758
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,159
with the web interfaces to help you

759
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:52,559
perform

760
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,760
a remote management targeting system

761
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,919
like i've explained earlier

762
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,960
it it actually becomes a very big

763
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,240
problem for you

764
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,640
for the end users who are going to be

765
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,519
the target of

766
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,880
such hackers furthermore

767
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,039
we'll show that we actually know the

768
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,880
basic details of the device

769
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
such as the device time the brand the

770
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
version and so on so forth

771
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,320
and this effectively actually means that

772
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,080
at the end of the day we

773
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,880
uh we don't even need to attack the

774
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,000
target directly we can just passively

775
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
find out all about the target and

776
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,760
prepare our payloads

777
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,240
and when we are ready we just launch the

778
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,279
attack onto the target

779
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,360
so for the next part of this uh workshop

780
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,200
uh we'll be actually going through to

781
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,559
get together

782
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,480
uh how to search on showdown and find

783
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
out about

784
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,679
uh and to find out how to use shorthand

785
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,880
showdown okay

786
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,279
so now to start off with showdown uh you

787
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,000
just go to the

788
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,200
showdowns website showdown.io and then

789
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,760
if

790
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,559
you have an account you should log in

791
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,360
already

792
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,960
otherwise i would encourage you to

793
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,279
actually log in for an account uh

794
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,320
on showdown so i'll probably give you

795
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,399
guys like a minute or two

796
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,320
to look uh to sign up or log into

797
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,919
showdown uh if you haven't

798
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:29,840
not done so

799
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,080
okay so uh hope you guys have really

800
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,519
locked in uh i'll

801
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,200
start by going through some of the

802
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,960
basics about showdown

803
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,519
um so first and foremost um showdown

804
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,519
actually have a

805
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,880
like google they have their search

806
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,760
operators to better help you to uh

807
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,360
you know streamline the search uh

808
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
results so that you

809
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,519
get uh better results or and you get the

810
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,880
results that you actually

811
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
want so first and foremost um for sure

812
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,279
we have the port uh we also have uh

813
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,039
we have basically the port we have the

814
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,919
net uh let me get it out here for you

815
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,080
guys

816
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,080
some of the uh one of the example

817
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,279
operators are like this

818
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,000
okay there you go so some of the

819
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,919
examples are like this uh we have

820
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,039
the port we have the net host name we

821
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,559
have the operating systems

822
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,679
uh country organization

823
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,000
um you know time frame that they scan

824
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,200
the system

825
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,880
we have the uh hash value

826
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,440
whether a certain screenshot is there

827
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,520
and whether or not a title exists

828
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,399
and more interestingly first i mean for

829
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,599
some of you

830
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,599
it's probably invulnerabilities um

831
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,960
by a cve vulnerability number

832
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,760
number as well so

833
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,159
by using uh by using this uh we can

834
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,760
actually

835
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,040
excuse me sorry i can actually help

836
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,480
we can actually streamline our search

837
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,159
results

838
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,040
so for example now if i were to be

839
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,760
looking up

840
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,159
uh if i'll be if i were to be looking

841
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,280
for

842
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,839
cisco devices in singapore for example

843
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,320
i'll be searching in the uh i'll be

844
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,879
searching

845
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,239
in the shura systems to look for cisco

846
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,040
devices

847
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,000
that are in the city singapore

848
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,200
and this will actually let us know uh

849
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,480
who uh which systems are in singapore

850
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,359
and are using cisco devices so you can

851
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,920
see we can see a lot of

852
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,280
amazon self uh hosted at m1 and stuff

853
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,880
uh recently unfortunately uh

854
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,160
we are getting flooded by honeypot uh

855
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,680
one of our one of our talks uh at st con

856
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,839
is also about honey pots

857
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,000
traditional just by coincidence

858
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,839
yeah so when the so honey pot also also

859
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:40,640
falls into

860
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
the search engine unfortunately because

861
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,680
after all

862
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,800
they are online so

863
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,520
uh showdown would definitely crawl onto

864
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,680
it

865
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,880
however uh on show that when a honeypot

866
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,720
is detected they actually do give a

867
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
label honeypot so you don't you know

868
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,960
that you are not falling for a traveler

869
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,520
in essence

870
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
so uh let's

871
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,440
try searching for linseed webcams okay

872
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,680
so since we know that linksys i mean if

873
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,440
you if you don't quit google you know

874
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,720
that linksys

875
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,760
web cameras they actually have a

876
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,839
certain title uh tm01 in the title

877
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,560
and we want to look for those with a

878
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
proper screenshot and how do we how can

879
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,480
we do that

880
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,320
you can just use the title and we use

881
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,400
the hash screenshots option

882
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,119
and let's take a look at the results

883
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,160
well

884
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,520
we actually have uh results of uh

885
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,119
this uh systems

886
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,119
and as you can see here we have the date

887
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,839
timestamp which is quite uh which is

888
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,119
pretty much right now this is in the

889
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,040
store

890
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,720
and so on so forth and these cameras

891
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,440
they are not not even protected just

892
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,680
uh available publicly so

893
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,879
if you take a look at one

894
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,720
many of times we might not actually be

895
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,560
able to get in because they are old

896
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,280
but when we do get in uh it will be

897
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,400
quite interesting

898
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,160
and here we are we are in

899
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,480
as you can see it's that simple

900
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,240
oh my internet is a little slow so

901
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,320
please just bear with me on my internet

902
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
speed here

903
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,119
uh and hey here we go

904
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,480
we're actually looking video live so

905
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,839
this is one of the ways that um

906
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,520
this is one of the ways that uh our

907
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,400
hiker friends they're actually maybe not

908
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,440
really friends

909
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,599
i mean you know those hackers actually

910
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,960
tried to access the uh

911
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,760
cameras in singapore so now if we were

912
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
to change the country code

913
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,440
you can put country because singapore is

914
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,680
both a country and city

915
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,280
you try ah

916
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,720
good news we are safe there's no

917
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,000
there's no uh linksys web cameras that

918
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,160
are active in singapore oh

919
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,119
said that a little too early and as you

920
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,960
can see

921
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,960
here we have one and then what's this

922
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,320
yeah this was just tested just last week

923
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,680
and it's in singapore

924
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,480
so yeah so this kind of examples

925
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,119
actually just show how scary it is to be

926
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,119
on a

927
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,359
to be on uh on the internet these days

928
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,880
actually

929
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,480
yeah so based on these examples we

930
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,560
actually can see that

931
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,680
uh it it's not exactly so

932
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,040
safe uh if we just leave everything to

933
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
default configuration

934
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,320
and here we are can we actually even

935
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,079
access it

936
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,960
oh wow we can it's still live okay i

937
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,599
think i better get off here

938
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,400
all right so yeah so that's how we can

939
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,480
actually use uh

940
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,560
how we can actually show them uh to

941
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,400
actually look for

942
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,760
this kind of information uh

943
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
not only about looking about information

944
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,000
on uh

945
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,640
on this kind of exploits ah sorry not

946
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,520
experts uh

947
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,200
looking at this kind of information

948
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,440
about web cameras and stuff

949
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,680
showdown is actually even useful if you

950
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,480
are to look

951
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,839
for vulnerabilities that um

952
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,760
exist so for example we're looking at

953
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,440
heartbeats

954
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,359
is probably one of the most popular um

955
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,040
vulnerability on the internet these days

956
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,359
i mean in the past at least and as you

957
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,400
can see um

958
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
by looking for the vulnerability it

959
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,560
actually returns to us all the different

960
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,119
servers

961
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,560
that have the vulnerability

962
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
as an attacker you don't even need to

963
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,000
look for a target you don't really need

964
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,160
to

965
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520
ping your target perform a

966
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,920
perform a fingerprint analysis directly

967
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,520
from your device

968
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,680
you can just use uh you can just use

969
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,960
showdown to search

970
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,319
who have already done the work for you

971
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,319
just to search for all these targets and

972
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,839
you have bingo you have your targets

973
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,960
so yeah and

974
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,400
that's it uh with and with that said

975
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
actually show that as you can see

976
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,319
showdown is actually very easy to use

977
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,880
and you have pretty much everything that

978
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,599
you need

979
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,680
at your fingertips and

980
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,040
that uh with that

981
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,440
and so with that we have actually come

982
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,990
towards the end of our session

983
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,800
[Music]

984
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,920
come back to the end of session and i

985
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,440
hope you guys found this session

986
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,520
interesting and i hope really hope that

987
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,200
you guys don't use this

988
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,400
for any reference purposes and

989
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,599
please keep in mind whatever that you do

990
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,319
whether or not it's legal or illegal

991
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,640
will be

992
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,200
will most likely be recorded still by

993
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,280
the end point

994
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,640
and with that uh

995
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,640
i like uh we'll move on to the q a

996
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,880
section uh so if you guys have any other

997
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,720
questions uh feel free to raise it up in

998
