uh my name is ken chung i am a part of

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,480
uh

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
the honey net project and an independent

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,079
security researcher

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,960
so uh during my free time i involving

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
some honeypot tools development

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,039
and try to play around with a different

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,319
uh deceptive

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,760
base uh defense mechanism uh

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,159
personally i always have this one big

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,400
question in my mind

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
so for example you and i we put our

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,640
personal file

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,119
on the internet then we leave it there

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,240
for

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,439
60 days or 90 days what will

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,560
happen to all them after 60 days or 90

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,520
days

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
will they still stay intact at the same

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,880
place

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,240
or all of them will be stolen after 60

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,640
days

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,439
or 90 days yeah so in fact this is a

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,880
small little idea

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,439
from so-called fundamentals uh idea

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,520
behind the scene for these uh

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
small little topics that we are going to

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,439
explore right here

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,960
who stole my hundred thousand dollars

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,119
worth of our bitcoin wallet

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,240
and let's catch them all with our

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
new deceptive baits yeah

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
let's try to explore about this together

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
for the next 30 minutes

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,479
so for the next 30 minutes we'll explore

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:04,960
about

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
three things right here first let's take

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
a quick look together

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,959
about an an open source new tool

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
that we have that we developed for this

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
particular purpose

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
namely uh honeybank secondly

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
let's take a quick look about how we are

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,440
crafted

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,400
those 100 000 worth of bitcoin wallet

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,599
and how we place it

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,959
across the internet last but not least

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,640
the most interesting part what happened

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,360
to all of this bitcoin wallet that we

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,840
put

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,040
on the internet after 90 days yeah

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
definitely i would love to stress some

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
of the lesson learned

72
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
some sort of the frustrations behind the

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
scene

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,640
and also some of the lesson learned uh

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,239
for all of us right here

76
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,879
yeah so let's try to do this together

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
nowadays uh all of us we know that our

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,159
lots of us gritty company

79
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,319
or scanned the entire internet try to

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,280
look for

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,560
insecure web service or expose

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
uh database or services on the internet

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
um lots of good brain behind the scene

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
try to find ways to secure these kind of

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,040
exposed services or devices or database

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,319
on the internet

87
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,080
definitely on the other side of the

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
world bad guy

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,120
they try to harvest those kinds the same

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
data set

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
look for uh so-called exposed

92
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,440
data sets on the same scanning result

93
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,760
with the malicious intent for example

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,879
they are trying to look for

95
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,879
some sort of server or internal system

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,280
and then those kind of juicy data that

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
are exposed to the internet

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
this will be includes uh credit card

99
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
user accredited information

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,680
user information or personal data

101
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,159
or even a corporate private data which

102
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,040
are accidentally

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,080
exposed to internet yeah for me i always

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,799
like to use

105
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
this uh small little analogy or

106
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
back in the real life for example a

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,478
teeth carry on back an empty bag

108
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,720
break into a house and then eventually

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,358
this guy will try to put all the jewelry

110
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,520
golds or silver and everything it was

111
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,479
kind of available

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
into the bag itself and then they were

113
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,479
carrying the bag the fullback

114
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,080
out from so-called uh the house itself

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
and then in the movies

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,919
sometimes we will see that sound of

117
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,600
folks they will put a small

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
gps tracker into those kind of bags

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
and then wherever the bag move from

120
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
locations to another locations um

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,160
those kind of small little gps tracker

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
will send a little ping

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
or give us some sort of the information

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
about

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,080
uh the guy who stole uh the bag itself

126
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
yeah i always wonder what if uh

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,759
anything we can do in this case in terms

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,199
of the cyber defender's

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,759
perspective now from a honeypot security

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,400
researcher's

131
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,680
point of view what if we can put

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
certain type of this type of gpx tracker

133
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
into those kind of our anti-back in this

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,240
case will be

135
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
the file or the data that we get stolen

136
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,360
wherever our data move from what a place

137
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,160
to another place will have some sort of

138
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,880
small

139
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,759
little informations about the bad guy

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,440
behind the scene

141
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,160
yeah um we are going to explore about

142
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,759
this kind of concept so called

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,280
honey token baits or breadcrumbs

144
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
over here definitely this kind of

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,360
technique is not brand new

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
it has been appeared since the past or

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
few years

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,840
but right now uh i believe that this is

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,919
definitely one of the very useful

150
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,280
uh so-called technology or so-called a

151
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,479
small little

152
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,639
concept they'll be very useful for all

153
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,479
of us as a cyber security

154
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,240
defenders let's do a quick real live

155
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
example together

156
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,199
bank name turn and also 2017 i came

157
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,880
across this a very wonderful

158
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
uh science blog post uh by uh

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
one of the very well-known scripting

160
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
gurus uh mr didier stephen

161
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,120
at that time uh bitcoin

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,960
price uh stood up all-time high

163
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,759
back in the end of uh year 2017 i think

164
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,680
it was hitting around

165
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
or maybe 19 000 us dollar per bitcoin

166
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,240
so at that time um mr d stephen

167
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
started to observe this very interesting

168
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
observations

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,199
on his uh web server a lot of folks are

170
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,000
trying to

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
pickpocket uh bitcoin wallet from his

172
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,639
web server in this case well um

173
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
he posted uh this very interesting web

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,919
server log

175
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,240
and then uh he started to observe uh

176
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,599
those uh

177
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,199
scanning pattern also called the

178
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,880
pickpocket patterns

179
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,199
came back after weeks and after weeks or

180
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
after months

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,400
yeah but for me definitely the most

182
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,479
interesting part is the pattern

183
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,759
that appear on this particular

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,720
web server lock itself so let's take a

185
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,280
quick look

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,680
together about these web server logs are

187
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
on the screen

188
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,599
personally i would like to say that this

189
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,599
is a very beautiful and very sexy

190
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,199
uh web server log yeah it's a

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,759
i believe it's apache or web server and

192
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,400
then

193
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,240
how can we read these easily will be

194
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
the first column is the ip address

195
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
and then followed by the next column

196
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,039
which is the

197
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,440
time stamp and then the hp of get

198
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,479
requests

199
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,879
also and continuously followed by the

200
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
uri

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
a hpv response code for example in this

202
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,319
case will be the 404

203
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,360
and last but not least followed by the

204
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,240
so-called the data size you know and

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
also the user agent itself

206
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,520
yeah uh in brief bad guy

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,400
tried to continuously hitting on uh mr

208
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,960
uh

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,599
leader stephen's a web server and then

210
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,599
this guy they tried his luck

211
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,039
by guessing uh just kind of a correct

212
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,240
uh bitcoin wallet founding also called a

213
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,719
crypto wallet founding yeah in this case

214
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,000
yep um

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,120
of course it was hit with a lot of

216
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
hdb4 for respawn code in this case

217
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,360
because there was no

218
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
bitcoin uh wallet over there

219
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,600
yeah um for me

220
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
what really catch our attention the most

221
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,800
is those the pattern of the crypto

222
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,360
wallet file name appear right in this

223
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,160
web server log itself

224
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,279
so let's take a quick uh deep dive into

225
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
this particular crypto world of founding

226
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,800
together well

227
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,839
a common crypto water file name it could

228
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,720
be

229
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,320
wallet underscore dot dat

230
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
or wallet dot d80 or some sort of maybe

231
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,640
model underscore backup.ed and then

232
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,519
somehow

233
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,279
uh the attackers they try to look for

234
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,040
some zip file

235
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,480
which contains the crypto wallet

236
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,640
in this case the zip file mainly as

237
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,000
volatile zip

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
or backup slash volatility

239
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,800
yeah as a security hobby researchers

240
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,440
i started to wonder if anything that we

241
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,279
can do in here

242
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,760
what if we can try to craft a zip file

243
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
and then we just feed it to the bad guy

244
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,800
with the data that

245
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,760
they need with the fake content in it

246
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,120
and eventually

247
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,160
when the folks start to open a zip file

248
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,040
or try to explore the zip file this zip

249
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
file

250
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
will get us some sort of the

251
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
informations

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
about behind i mean the guy behind the

253
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,240
scene yeah

254
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,079
this is just a very small idea and

255
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,680
eventually this start to form

256
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,720
so-called new tools that i'd like to

257
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
introduce today right here

258
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,240
namely honeybank

259
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
well honeyback is a tool that will help

260
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,200
you

261
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
to create a big archive file zip file in

262
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,360
this case

263
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
with any folders or files in it

264
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,519
and then it will notify you if someone

265
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,360
open it and assess it

266
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
yeah um definitely the main goal right

267
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,839
here we just want to really hope that

268
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,240
it will notify us if someone access our

269
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
data

270
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,399
and it will give us some sort of the

271
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,640
information behind i mean about the guy

272
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
behind the scene

273
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,440
we hope that this could be useful for

274
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,760
the community especially from a cyber

275
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,320
defender's

276
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,279
point of view um definitely we love to

277
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,880
we hope that this will be useful

278
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,079
in terms of a data breach detections or

279
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,000
deceptive based mechanism which uh

280
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
everyone obviously experienced this year

281
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,720
in the upcoming years yeah so let's

282
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
explore together about how honeyback

283
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
works

284
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,600
honeymag is a new open source tool it's

285
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
probably available

286
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,680
on the internet on github right now yeah

287
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,079
it contains three different components

288
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,440
first has a honeymac client

289
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,600
secondly we have a honeyback simple dns

290
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
server

291
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
third it we can use a

292
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,839
responder together uh because this will

293
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,560
be very

294
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,399
useful you know to gel up the whole

295
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,839
things uh together

296
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,200
so from the screen right here you can

297
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,920
see that this is how uh

298
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,440
uh what happened when honeyback runs

299
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,880
it's just a nice it's pretty simple

300
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,680
easily to use uh common lines tools

301
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,320
yeah um let's try to explore about

302
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
what is the final zip file

303
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,359
that honeyback created

304
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
up from the screen right from the right

305
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
screen right here you can see that this

306
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,279
is the

307
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,560
so-called tree view of the zip file that

308
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,600
generated by honeybank so in this case

309
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,240
uh

310
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
we generate one of the file zip file

311
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
called secret.zip

312
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,920
and then it contains a secret folder uh

313
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,040
in the folder itself we'll just have one

314
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,959
file in it which is in this case i'm

315
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,320
naming it as a supersecret documents.pdf

316
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,120
yeah this is just a very simple uh zip

317
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,399
file in this case

318
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,040
and this is the file that uh so called

319
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,480
the final output

320
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,680
for um as a result of this a honeyback

321
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,079
client

322
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,959
itself yeah during the generation

323
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
process

324
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
honeyback will automatically slot two

325
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,320
new file into the zip file itself from

326
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,600
what you can see on the screen right

327
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,399
here

328
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,639
the zip file will be end with the file

329
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,920
extension call dot

330
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,279
url and then the second second file will

331
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,680
be the desktop.ini

332
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
in fact these two files will form so

333
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,839
called the alerting mechanisms

334
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,600
or behind the scene for us yeah um

335
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,040
let's try to explore about these two

336
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
files together desktop.ini

337
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,720
this file is commonly found in a windows

338
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,079
operating system

339
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,880
in fact the legitimate usage for this

340
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,399
desktop.ini

341
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,320
is related to how windows folder

342
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,720
how they display on the windows explorer

343
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,120
but for example in this case

344
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,160
if we want to customize icon

345
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
about how folders are displayed on the

346
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,519
windows explorer

347
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,040
we can customize it in the desktop.ini

348
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,000
um also we can customize those info tips

349
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,240
for how the folder display on windows

350
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,920
explorer as well in this case for

351
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,839
example if we

352
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
move our mouse over to the folder

353
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,399
and then it will show about this kind of

354
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,639
small little info tips

355
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,160
that this is what we can configure with

356
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,720
desktop.i9

357
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,399
yeah but uh definitely uh this is how

358
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,079
one of the interesting techniques that

359
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,800
found by a team's canary token

360
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,279
and in fact our tools honeyback inspired

361
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,000
a lot

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,040
by the team's canary token so while

363
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,800
the desktop.ini try to look for

364
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,399
icon pictures from a local machines

365
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,600
or in this case what if we can try to

366
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,079
tweak

367
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,959
this particular location we try to ask

368
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,440
desktop.ini

369
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,399
to look for icon file on the excellent

370
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,680
location

371
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,440
it could be uh from a domain that's

372
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,160
sitting outside

373
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,639
internet or it could be some sort of ip

374
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,000
address that's sitting

375
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,760
across some um servers on the internet

376
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,079
yeah in this case this form of very

377
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,800
interesting

378
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,079
and very fascinating uh techniques

379
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,560
in terms of the alerting mechanism

380
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,440
itself

381
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,639
yeah the second files will be the

382
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,079
dot url file on this the url file

383
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,720
in the legitimate usage is meant for the

384
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
convenient purpose

385
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,240
for example if someone try to click on

386
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
the url file

387
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,839
the dot ur file will lead us to the

388
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,839
www.adc

389
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,160
www.cdf.com

390
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,199
out there yeah same tricks

391
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,519
same techniques that can be implemented

392
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,240
in the

393
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,120
url file which is we can ask the url

394
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,839
file

395
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,279
to reach out to some sort of the icon

396
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,839
files

397
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,639
on the external location in this case

398
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,199
yeah

399
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,079
um these two files and the tag itself

400
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,720
are

401
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,160
really uh pretty handy and then in fact

402
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,720
in fact these are start to play all the

403
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,199
things

404
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,759
into this uh our honeyback client the

405
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,519
common line client so

406
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
yeah so the next question is once we

407
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,839
generate all this kind of

408
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,120
secret zip file what if a bad guy

409
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,560
open and unzip our secret zip file

410
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,759
and click into the secret folder

411
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,160
what will happen in this case

412
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,680
well in this case

413
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,079
honeyback will start to generate two

414
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,759
alerts

415
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,839
to circle to our honey back simple dns

416
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,399
server

417
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,199
and also the responder that we set up

418
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,639
behind the scene

419
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,600
well um that's not the ini we're trying

420
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,000
to reach

421
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,680
out to uh the domain the dns server

422
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,160
uh that we set up in this case and then

423
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,880
uh

424
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
for our simple dns server we try to

425
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,959
listen for all the incoming alerts

426
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,920
in terms of the dns traffic now we try

427
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,240
to set up a discount for a simple

428
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,599
sql 3 logging for a lot about

429
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,319
those kind of data that we receive from

430
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,799
our

431
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,919
honeyback client we will collect some

432
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,319
sort of

433
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,199
information such as the computer name

434
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,079
username

435
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,720
or the domain name of whoever tried to

436
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,199
open

437
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,799
our zip file that we created just now

438
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,840
yeah and then later stage the

439
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,320
url file let's try to reach out to our

440
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,039
responder

441
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,760
in this case our responder will try to

442
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
listen for all the incoming traffic

443
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,039
you know with the smb network protocol

444
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,000
um we try to collect information such as

445
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
the ntr and the hashes

446
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
or ntim v2 hashes in this case so

447
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,960
in overall we will try to we'll have

448
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
various pieces of information on hand

449
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
such as

450
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,640
an ip address that whoever opened the

451
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,679
zip file

452
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,799
had the username computer name domain

453
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,919
name

454
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,080
and if you're lucky enough we have those

455
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,200
kind of nti

456
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,760
hashes as well so these kind of small

457
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,080
little pieces of the informations

458
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
definitely will form a very interesting

459
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,559
pictures in terms of the investigations

460
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,960
later well um

461
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,799
in terms of the alerting mechanism in

462
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,000
this case yeah

463
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,960
we are highly relying on our so-called

464
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,520
windows

465
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,880
unc path so

466
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,280
in fact this particular approach is more

467
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,559
applicable for

468
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,840
windows operating system well this is

469
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,360
kind of just a small little

470
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,520
uh limitations right here of for example

471
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,080
if uh someone tried to open our zip

472
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
files

473
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,480
on the linux or on the mac oss machines

474
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,280
well in this case we will not receive

475
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,080
any

476
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,799
uh alerts you know and which is in the

477
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,720
simple dns server or the responder in

478
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,840
this case

479
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
well um we're trying to explore about

480
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,960
different techniques in the future as

481
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,440
well

482
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,480
for linux units and

483
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,440
also oss or operating system in this

484
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,000
case

485
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,760
so if you came across with any

486
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,840
interesting idea behind the scene

487
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
feel free to reach out to us definitely

488
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,919
we want to implement more and more

489
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,799
techniques into

490
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,799
the honeyback uh in this case in the

491
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,760
future developments

492
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,320
well right now we have uh

493
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,840
a new tools on hand and then uh

494
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,039
we can try to create a zip file

495
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,760
with uh lots of defect deceptive base

496
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,559
into it

497
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,280
or you can create thousands of zip files

498
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
easily with our honeyback tools right

499
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,760
now

500
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,679
just a common line of two just common

501
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
live tools you can just simply play with

502
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
our different scripts

503
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,760
and some other stuff uh in it

504
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,480
yeah once you have these tools on hand

505
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,320
the next big question in our mind will

506
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,120
be

507
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,320
how can we play with it and get the best

508
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,320
of it yeah we try to explore a couple of

509
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,039
different ideas behind the scene for

510
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,080
example

511
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,919
let's try to set up some sort of servers

512
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,280
and try to

513
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,320
put the zip files on the internet but uh

514
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
after a while we came across if this is

515
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,520
a very interesting idea

516
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,840
everybody gonna love bitcoin wallet

517
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,760
so what if

518
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
we try to place a hundred thousand

519
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,640
dollars worth of bitcoin wallet

520
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
on the internet and we just leave it

521
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
there for 90 days

522
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,080
what will happen to all of them

523
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,360
yeah this is a very simple uh use case

524
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,480
and then uh because uh if when we talk

525
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,840
about wallet it's going to be

526
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
interesting definitely

527
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,640
but for me right now there's another

528
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,200
big challenge in my mind right here

529
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,120
because the problems right here

530
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,679
i don't have a 100 000 bitcoin wallets

531
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,559
in here

532
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,039
yeah i mean in my pocket definitely so i

533
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,960
would say that i wish that i really had

534
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,799
that this kind of a bitcoin order

535
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,720
and if someone really can donate this to

536
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,159
me one day

537
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,679
tomorrow or in the future

538
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,919
i really appreciate the mason thank you

539
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,200
very much in advance

540
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,280
yeah oh well during the explorations of

541
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,480
our process

542
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
we came across with these a very

543
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,799
interesting uh so-called alternative

544
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,559
namely uh bitcoin test net

545
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,600
yep so we try to create a 10

546
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,320
bitcoin volume in this case and then

547
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,000
each of the bitcoin wallet

548
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,200
is unprotected with any username or any

549
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,919
password

550
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,679
or any sort of encryption mechanism

551
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,799
each of the water cells will contain one

552
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,080
btc test net well there are some

553
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,200
differences between the

554
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,159
btc test net and the real btc in this

555
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:06,880
case

556
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,600
the main difference is uh this btc

557
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,480
testnet

558
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,120
definitely doesn't contain any value

559
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,799
associated with a so-called the real

560
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,840
value such as

561
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,120
the us dollar in this case uh two of

562
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,159
them

563
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,120
the uh bitcoin address or the bitcoin

564
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,480
tesla address

565
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,360
will uh will prefix with a different

566
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,400
value

567
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,840
but then for me i feel that the

568
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,559
bitcoin wallet they look pretty similar

569
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,200
yeah

570
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,919
so you you can use the same so-called

571
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,840
crypto wallets program in order to

572
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,360
open it and the best part of this uh bts

573
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,960
bcc tesla we can get it freely from

574
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,400
a loss of forces in the internet yeah

575
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,640
in this case uh btc testnet is meant for

576
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,919
blockchains uh volume or applications uh

577
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,039
developers

578
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,559
uh you can use it to make lots of

579
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,480
transactions and those kind of

580
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,120
transactions well this looks like uh

581
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,480
real

582
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,679
um bitcoin and then uh

583
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,039
uh definitely i would like to use that

584
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,760
if you let go for this approach

585
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
once we finish use it uh definitely try

586
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,200
to transfer

587
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,320
back all this kind of bc btc testnet

588
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,080
back to the faucet because this will be

589
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,159
very useful for the com

590
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,480
for the community to for the different

591
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,080
testing purposes

592
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,520
yeah so back in uh when we

593
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,840
start this particular use case uh in

594
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
early 2020

595
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,640
in fact at that time around one btc

596
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,919
bitcoin

597
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,039
is almost equivalent to 10 000 uh us

598
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:43,679
dollar

599
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,320
but right now i know from uh for example

600
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,600
like yesterday

601
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,320
uh bitcoin bitcoin value is almost

602
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,600
equivalent to 18 or 19 000 us dollars

603
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,640
at the end of this uh 2020. yeah

604
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,159
i would say thanks to govi

605
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
well another case we try to explore

606
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,039
right here

607
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,400
is about uh mid con about water

608
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,799
i would say that uh wallet in terms of

609
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,559
the human psychology this is one of the

610
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,080
very interesting terms

611
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,600
it is about a tools or a place or a

612
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,919
placeholder for all of us the whole

613
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,760
valuable such as credit card

614
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,880
cash notes or

615
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,520
identification item identification card

616
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,480
in this case

617
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,039
oh so in real life if a wallet

618
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,919
lying on lying on the restaurants on the

619
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,120
streets

620
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,840
will people take it and pick it up and

621
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,679
try to contact the owner

622
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,840
or just some people just take it and

623
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
take the cash out of it

624
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,240
yeah the same analogy as well what do

625
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,960
you phone

626
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
we try to place those kind of a bitcoin

627
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,159
wallet

628
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,679
openly on the internet what

629
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,520
will happen to all of them yeah

630
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,919
in this case we uh we put our

631
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,320
10 bitcoin wallets on these open

632
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,760
directory listings

633
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,919
on this uh different servers on the

634
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,600
internet

635
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,159
we just let them sitting quietly over

636
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:16,720
there

637
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,400
we just want to wait for things to be

638
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
happen of course

639
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,919
we try to craft those kind of websites

640
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,600
to looks real for example

641
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,400
they contain lots of bunch of our

642
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
personal file and other documents

643
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,400
on the same wrestler so yeah initially

644
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,760
we as what we expect will be

645
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,279
this kind of very interesting and very

646
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,679
sexy lock because uh for example

647
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,760
laws of bad guy will try to chase over

648
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
your web server

649
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,919
and try to hunt a lot of uh try to

650
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,120
pickpocket the loss of

651
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,400
this bitcoin wallet from our web server

652
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,880
i mean this is what appeared on uh mr

653
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,520
didier's

654
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,799
stephen's web server logs back in 2017

655
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,000
and this is our initial expectations but

656
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,960
over the time

657
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
for the first of 30 days or maybe 35

658
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,640
days

659
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,360
our web server logs is really quiet and

660
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,240
uh this is

661
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,360
really really disappointing

662
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,919
initially we thought of our idea is

663
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,440
totally a failure

664
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,279
we won't be able to get any single

665
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,880
result of this

666
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,559
yeah what you have seen on the screen

667
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,799
right here this is our real

668
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,320
web server logs which is really quiet

669
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,039
from time to time you can see that uh

670
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,400
there may be some cats

671
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,400
or flies just flying to our

672
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,720
website if we lucky enough at the time

673
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,360
uh we'll observe some sort of googlebots

674
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,159
or google

675
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,120
or bingsbot crawl into the web server

676
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,960
and just say hi to us

677
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,159
yeah um i will say that uh

678
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,520
it could be due to the main reason that

679
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,159
this is just a newly set up web server

680
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,159
and no one really know that uh there's

681
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,679
this kind of web server access

682
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,720
on the internet so uh the first lesson

683
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,440
learned

684
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,960
just be patient yeah after a while

685
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,760
we start to have this kind of talk how

686
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,320
can we improve

687
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,440
the entire situations right here so we

688
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,520
decided to go for a more proactive

689
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,640
approach

690
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,960
we started to put some sort of

691
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
informations on page bin

692
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,840
for example everybody this is our

693
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,120
personal bitcoin wallet

694
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,960
uh uh please don't

695
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,480
download it yeah uh but definitely once

696
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,000
we put the word please don't download it

697
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,279
on password

698
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,880
things are starting to go crazy and

699
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,640
getting more interesting

700
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
because people will start to download it

701
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,080
from our web server

702
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,399
for all our bitcoin wallet that we put

703
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,679
on the

704
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,760
our web server so ladies and gentlemen

705
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,279
what happened after 90 days for all our

706
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,919
bitcoin bullets

707
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,279
yeah so in this case all the 10 of our

708
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,559
bitcoin wallet

709
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,559
which generated from honeyback was

710
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,919
stolen

711
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,360
nine of 10 of the wallet alerters

712
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,039
with the teeth information is behind the

713
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,720
scene um

714
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,080
we have one missing wallets out there

715
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,760
it could be due to uh maybe the wallet

716
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,320
was accessed in uh unix machines or

717
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,919
linear machines or

718
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,480
manual access machines um definitely the

719
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,520
most one of the

720
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,559
interesting oscillation is a the fastest

721
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,520
record for the stolen's water is almost

722
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,880
less than a minute

723
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,000
once we posted um so called the link

724
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
also got a message on the place in page

725
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,399
being sold

726
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,720
i think this could be due to some

727
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,120
automated board but who knows

728
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,840
it could be sort of a real humans behind

729
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,320
the keyboard

730
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
for the next five to ten minutes let me

731
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,559
share with you uh everyone right here

732
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,039
about

733
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,279
one of the very unexpected scene about

734
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,440
this in this case

735
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,080
yeah someone just totally kind of wiped

736
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,640
out

737
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,840
our well one of our um

738
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,240
bitcoin tesla wallet over there hey

739
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,279
buddy

740
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,039
bitcoin btc tesla doesn't contain any

741
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,600
value

742
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,960
in this case but i'm not sure why uh

743
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,640
this guy tried to uh totally empty out

744
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,080
our bitcoin uh test number right here

745
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,559
yeah um so this entire incident uh

746
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,279
happened around uh march 24th and march

747
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,640
um uh 23rd at that time

748
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
we started creating this bitcoin wallet

749
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,840
uh back in uh

750
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,679
march 23rd uh 2020 2020 early this year

751
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,000
now we leave it there on our website on

752
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,039
march 23rd and then within less than

753
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,200
24 hours surprisingly unexpectedly

754
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,120
uh the the value in the bitcoin will

755
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,320
become totally empty and becomes zero

756
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,159
yeah well let's try to investigate the

757
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,000
entire incidents together

758
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,919
we'll explore about three components

759
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,640
right here so first the web server log

760
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,760
second is the uh the honeyback dns alert

761
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,520
and the third will be the responder

762
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,200
let's take a quick look about the

763
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,880
timeline analysis for this uh

764
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,799
incidence from the web server lock

765
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,000
perspective

766
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
what you have seen on the screen right

767
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,360
here this is just a common apache logs

768
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,559
that are

769
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,760
that we have um some folks

770
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,440
we try to access our web server

771
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,640
and then grab this uh wallet.zip file

772
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,720
from a location called slash bitcoin

773
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,559
slash holders.zip

774
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,000
and then in fact our web server returned

775
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,520
the hp response code 200 and then we

776
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,919
you can see it is just a very common uh

777
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,559
firefox

778
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,000
version 74 uh user agent itself

779
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,399
uh this entire incident happened around

780
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,279
in during

781
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,840
1440 utc in terms of the time stamp

782
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,720
perspective few minutes

783
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,399
after that 1442 udc

784
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,360
um we started to receive a bunch of dns

785
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,320
requests

786
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,600
in our dns honeyback dns

787
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,880
web server you can see on the screen

788
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,679
right here

789
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,360
we receive a pretty long dns

790
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,640
request this is a kind of

791
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,799
pre-crafted in our dns back

792
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,360
i mean our honey back on dns server

793
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,240
itself

794
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,080
so for the first column it will

795
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,919
equivalent to the username

796
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,279
of whoever the machines that access

797
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,880
our uh so-called.zip file in this case

798
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,080
uh the username

799
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
will be equivalent to blue yeah and then

800
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,919
the second column

801
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,519
which is a desktop dash afn

802
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,960
and b6k this is equivalent to the

803
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,559
so-called computer name

804
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,039
and then it followed by the domain name

805
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,159
which is uh

806
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,240
the desktop dash am m fb6k

807
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,760
so by looking at the log itself

808
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,360
it indicates the bad guy unzip our zip

809
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,399
file

810
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,080
looking into our zip file the particular

811
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,559
folder itself on the windows explorer

812
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,519
on the wins on the windows machine yeah

813
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,960
definitely um

814
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,000
the best part we start to receive a kind

815
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,279
of a bunch of

816
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,480
dns alerts for almost a 20 minutes

817
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,919
non-stop 20 minutes yeah um this really

818
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,559
give us a good indicator that hey buddy

819
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,240
somebody is really looking into

820
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
your zip out and uh

821
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,679
access into this uh into the zip file

822
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,000
itself

823
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,440
let's take a quick look on the third

824
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,519
component yeah

825
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,919
after a couple of minutes after the dns

826
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,480
alert we start to receive uh

827
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,200
you know so-called smb traffic you know

828
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,320
responder

829
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,600
yep um from those are both the

830
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,960
highlighter in the yellow color

831
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,600
blue and desktop dash a m efmb6k

832
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,480
is exactly equivalent to the same

833
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,240
username and the same

834
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,159
uh computer name or the domain name

835
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,399
which appear on on our dns or server

836
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:18,960
locks uh

837
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,000
just now yeah um right now

838
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,399
we have to have some sort of the ndr

839
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,320
ntim v2 hashes

840
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,120
and it could be useful for uh the

841
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,240
analysis latest

842
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,640
in details yeah so just in brief

843
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,440
this is just the overall timelines that

844
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,519
for entire incidents to happen

845
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,960
1440 utc i'll follow the z file

846
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,600
get stolen from our web server two

847
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,039
minutes afterwards

848
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,240
we started to get uh the first dns alert

849
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,440
from our honeyback dns server

850
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,080
this really indicated that somebody open

851
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,679
and unzip our zip file

852
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,799
access into the zip file yeah

853
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,960
and he means the later ones we start to

854
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,120
observe the smb alerts in our respondent

855
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,040
last but not least uh 35 minutes

856
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,159
from our first wallet gets stolen

857
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,040
he or she just uh totally wipe out our

858
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,000
bitcoin wallet

859
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,040
by transfer the entire one btc test

860
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,520
of it i have no idea why

861
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,199
he tried to uh wipe out our

862
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,480
btc tesla in this case but i believe

863
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,440
it could be due to he or she found about

864
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,199
what we have done right here

865
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,119
and he or she is really pissed off

866
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,320
about what we did but

867
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,918
definitely the first lesson learned i

868
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,399
mean it is always good to

869
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,839
have different pieces of the

870
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,918
informations right here and eventually

871
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,320
we can gel all the evidence together

872
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,960
it will give us a very good uh pictures

873
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,119
in terms of a cyber defender's

874
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,839
point of view yeah

875
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,599
i would love to share about some of the

876
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,520
some of the lesson learned right here

877
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,240
new and don'ts um definitely the first

878
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,760
lesson then right here

879
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,440
just be patient yeah initially

880
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,920
we expect that those very beautiful web

881
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,880
server log

882
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,359
people fight with each other so try to

883
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,480
grab those kind of

884
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,280
bitcoin wallets from our web server when

885
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,079
in fact

886
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,680
it take us pretty long time

887
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,640
in order to to get those kind of uh

888
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,760
first hit

889
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,800
on our web server locks this uh

890
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,920
so-called it's always the pain and fun

891
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,280
for lots of honeypot security

892
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,440
researchers around the world

893
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,920
it always take time until the day that

894
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,720
we can harvest the good result

895
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,880
from our use cases or from our

896
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,920
experience

897
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,119
yeah secondly um

898
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,400
i would really suggest that they

899
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,040
customize our own unique bits in this

900
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,599
case

901
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,000
for example we can customize our new

902
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,119
file names

903
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,040
different tokens or different alerting

904
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,560
mechanisms

905
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,599
i believe that the more unique it can be

906
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,800
the best result that we can get a out of

907
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,760
the scene

908
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,200
yeah and then

909
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,280
i would pretty suggest i put a warning

910
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,720
banner for example

911
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,760
say that hey buddy this is our this is a

912
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,960
private and confidential data you are

913
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,440
not

914
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,599
allowed to access it this is

915
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,560
unauthorized

916
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,079
uh for you but i think

917
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,760
when somebody is already don't care

918
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,119
about this kind of banner

919
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,880
that's how the interesting stuff uh

920
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,160
started yeah

921
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,880
but so no last but not least i'll

922
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,839
definitely

923
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,359
never underestimate about the great

924
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,680
impact of this kind of a small little

925
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,040
or deceptive bait initially the entire

926
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,280
design is just meant for

927
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,839
windows operating system in this case um

928
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,320
at first personally i doubt about this

929
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,520
kind of approach

930
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,160
but uh after a while we start to collect

931
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,839
a lot of interesting result of

932
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,440
especially nine of 10 of our bitcoin

933
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,920
wallets

934
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,400
really give us a interesting result and

935
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,359
this is something

936
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,240
really unexpected in our use case yeah

937
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,280
honey honeyback uh it's an open source

938
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,119
