00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,520
hello everyone and welcome to trust but

4
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,240
verify

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
maintaining democracy in spite of

6
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,439
information countermeasures

7
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,600
my name is ally mellen i'm a security

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
strategist in the office of the cso at

9
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,799
cyber reason

10
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,640
i've spent the last decade in various

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,000
tech roles

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
i spent several years of that in

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
security working on my own security

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,640
research

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
and now i spend my time looking to

16
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,360
advance security think about the future

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,240
of security

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,200
and also help implement that in our own

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,920
organization

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
and i want to start the presentation

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
talking about what's truly critical to

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,439
our daily life

23
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
because this plays into voting more than

24
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
one might think

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
and so automatically when i think about

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,119
what's really critical to our daily life

27
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,880
i think about maslow's hierarchy of

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
needs

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
this pyramid encompasses all the things

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,439
that

31
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
maslow suspects that we need in order to

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
reach self-actualization and achieve our

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,959
full potential

34
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
the base of that pyramid are the

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,879
physiological needs these are things

36
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,680
like air

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
water food all of the things that you

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,280
really

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
absolutely need in order to just have

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
life

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
but above that actually comes that

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,440
safety element things like personal

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
security

44
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
employment any other resources that you

45
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,280
need to really live

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
a layer above that you come into

47
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,879
belonging things like

48
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,840
friendship intimacy that sense of

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
connection that you get

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
from being a part of a community and

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,760
above that you have esteem

52
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,040
things like respect and status

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,000
recognition and of course self-esteem as

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
well

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,280
and this is all leading up to

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680
self-actualization and

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,400
becoming the most that one can be you

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
need all of these things to reach

59
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,840
that top of the pyramid and so my

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
question is

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
where does voting fit into that not

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
necessarily as something that you need

63
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,319
to live

64
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,440
but as something that you have all of

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,200
these needs that need to be met before

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,720
you're actually willing to go vote

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,159
and at cyber reason we've been actually

68
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,720
identifying this through what we call

69
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
operation blackout protect the vote

70
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,400
these are a series of exercises that

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,239
i've taken part in organized for the

72
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,760
past two years

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
with members of the fbi secret service

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,519
and other law enforcement officials

75
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,799
across the world

76
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,120
and in these exercises we actually take

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
ethical hackers

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,840
we put them against law enforcement in

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,519
the tabletop exercise

80
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,360
where the hackers are trying to attack

81
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,879
the election

82
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,400
and the law enforcement is trying to

83
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,239
protect it it's usually

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
over set over the course of just

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
election day

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,599
and it's really meant to help us better

87
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,799
understand

88
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,720
what law enforcement is prepared for and

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
what they aren't so that we can improve

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,080
those processes

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,879
no actual hacking is done but the point

92
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,360
is

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,000
really to understand where law

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,279
enforcement is lacking

95
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,199
in order to make it better we see this a

96
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,639
lot for those of you who are in the

97
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,680
security industry

98
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,880
with red teaming where the red team is

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,440
actually

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,560
looking to attack and infiltrate

101
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,280
an organization in order to ultimately

102
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
make it more secure that's all that

103
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
we're doing these exercises

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
and one of the key points of the

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,520
exercises is that we do it in such a way

106
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
where we do not actually attack the

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,040
voting equipment or those things that we

108
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,880
would classically consider

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,080
to be um related to voting

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,280
infrastructure

111
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,759
like the actual polling stations

112
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,720
themselves

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
the machines there's a plethora of

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,639
research being done on that but that's

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,160
not what we're looking at here we're

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,919
trying to look at a more encompassing

117
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,680
view

118
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,639
and that's what we're going to talk

119
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,240
about today we're going to start with

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
the defender perspective

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,160
really get dig into the daily life of a

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,800
voter

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
before using that information to think

124
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,479
about things from the attacker

125
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,600
perspective

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
from there i really want you guys to be

127
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,440
thinking about and brainstorming

128
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
throughout this entire process

129
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,240
what could you do to stop an election if

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,039
you wanted to

131
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,840
whether it's hacking whether it's using

132
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,720
some other means

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
what could you do to stop or cause chaos

134
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
during an election

135
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,560
and this will really naturally lead into

136
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,440
a conversation

137
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
about how we can actually use that

138
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,880
information to then protect our

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,600
elections

140
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
which is the goal for all of us here

141
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,039
so let's dive into the defender

142
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,520
perspective

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,720
what we've seen at a government level

144
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
is election infrastructure is really

145
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,919
limited

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
to voter registration databases i.t

147
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,759
infrastructure systems

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
voting systems all of these things that

149
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
are not really comprehensive of the

150
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,479
greater picture they're very limited

151
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
down into um the actual voting systems

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,639
that we're using

153
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,720
but the question that i have is is that

154
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
really all

155
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
is that really all that we should be

156
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
thinking about here

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,199
and throughout the course of these

158
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,880
exercises what we found

159
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,400
is that it's not and instead

160
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
we can think about voting through its

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,199
own hierarchy of needs much like

162
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,919
maslow's period

163
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,000
now this pyramid actually addresses

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,039
maslow's hierarchy of needs

165
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,639
and is pretty closely linked to it

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,680
for example with physiological needs

167
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
we're talking about things like life and

168
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,800
death and property

169
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
without these things you're much less

170
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,960
likely to go vote

171
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
if you're afraid for your safety

172
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,280
probably not going to go vote

173
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
if you are losing your home you have

174
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,599
bigger priorities

175
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,639
considering um to

176
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,160
rather than going to vote similarly with

177
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,759
things like safety

178
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,599
if you don't feel safe if you don't feel

179
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
like your family is healthy

180
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,520
it makes it much more difficult to go be

181
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
willing to vote

182
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
unless there is something that seems so

183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,319
critical about voting

184
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,560
that you're motivated to do it

185
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
and then also belonging if you don't

186
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,759
feel like you belong

187
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
in the community or the country that

188
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,039
you're in

189
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,479
you are much less likely to go vote for

190
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,080
some candidate because you don't feel

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
like you're a part of the system

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,680
and then of course esteem this comes

193
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
into play in a lot of areas

194
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
but particularly if you don't feel like

195
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
your vote matters

196
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,639
which we know a large portion of the

197
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,479
population does not feel like their vote

198
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,520
matters

199
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
that it's just one vote in a sea of

200
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
votes if you feel that way

201
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,080
then you are much less likely to vote

202
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
and that is something that we've seen

203
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,638
time and time again

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
and then of course self-actualization

205
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,000
being the best that you can be

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,199
if you feel like you are not the best

207
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
person that you can be or like you're

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,919
not at that point

209
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
then you're much less likely to go vote

210
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,759
and all of this comes into what i

211
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,319
consider

212
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
the voter hierarchy of needs these are

213
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
as i said all of the things that you

214
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,360
need in order to feel safe and

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,080
comfortable

216
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,839
going to vote so when we think about

217
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
election infrastructure

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,880
well my question is is that really all

219
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,959
or are we having a very narrow

220
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,920
definition

221
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,120
tied to the voting machines themselves

222
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
that doesn't encompass all of the

223
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,399
factors to consider

224
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,920
when you're dealing with human beings

225
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,959
who have other priorities

226
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,320
day jobs other concerns because you have

227
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
all of these systems

228
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,080
that you now need to protect in order

229
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,680
for people to feel safe enough

230
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,760
and comfortable enough to go vote and

231
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
motivated enough

232
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,640
so these systems to protect actually

233
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,399
become systems that are a target

234
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,200
and in a nation like the united states

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,279
where 40 percent of eligible citizens do

236
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:21,920
not vote at

237
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,279
all any kind of voter suppression has

238
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,200
impact on an election any

239
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
so there are other elements to election

240
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
infrastructure that relate to voter

241
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
suppression faith in government and

242
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
other factors and what i want to get at

243
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,040
here is that

244
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
there are other ways to influence an

245
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,040
election

246
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
than attacking the voting machines and

247
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,959
voter suppression is

248
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,040
ultimately an attack on democracy

249
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,200
so let's jump into the attacker

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,880
perspective and really get

251
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,600
a better idea of what can be attacked

252
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,160
and again

253
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,839
i really want to point out that this

254
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,279
isn't evil

255
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,959
to jump into the attacker perspective

256
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,000
isn't evil it's why we read team

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
and it's really important to making sure

258
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,440
that we

259
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,040
are prepared for unexpected situations

260
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,800
so attackers targeting an election are

261
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,680
motivated

262
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,240
by one of three things the first is

263
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,959
potentially gaining power

264
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,680
and we see this with countries like um

265
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,720
like united states and like russia

266
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
second is to spread a particular

267
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,399
ideology and we've seen this

268
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
again um with many many countries a good

269
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,839
example is china

270
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,600
and then the third is to maintain their

271
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,360
global recognition

272
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
and support and to push their own agenda

273
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,720
so when i think about cyber attacks um

274
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
we actually at cyber reason our cso

275
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,839
likes to think about them as three

276
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,920
different layers and so i stole this

277
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,519
from him and i really like this way of

278
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,880
thinking about it you can attack

279
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
three different layers with the cyber

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
attack the infrastructure

281
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,839
plane the information plane or the ethos

282
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,120
plane

283
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,640
and the ethos plane that's that belief

284
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,200
system

285
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
the information plane is the actual

286
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
communication that you're getting

287
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
and then the infrastructure plane that's

288
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
that physical layer

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,480
things like the electric grid public

290
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,279
transit

291
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,160
physically stopping everyday activities

292
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
and what i want to do is start by

293
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,920
talking about some attacks

294
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,399
on the ethos plane and we're going to

295
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,560
take some modern day examples but also

296
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,360
some historical examples

297
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,800
in this part of the talk so again

298
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
ethos plane that's that belief system

299
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,120
bear that in mind as we go through this

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
and i want to start with the italian

301
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,600
elections of 1948.

302
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,399
1948 was a big time for election

303
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,000
interference

304
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
the us government was intent on

305
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
psychological warfare

306
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,920
and um millions of dollars

307
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,160
was going to christian democratic and

308
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,839
right-wing socialist parties

309
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,160
in italy at this time in order to sway

310
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,519
their election

311
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,920
there was a massive propaganda campaign

312
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
against communist

313
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,920
and socialist coalitions and the goal

314
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
was to change the perception of the

315
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,880
election

316
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,720
into one of democracy versus

317
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,120
totalitarianism and

318
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,560
christianity versus atheism america

319
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
versus the soviet union

320
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,839
and of course abundance versus

321
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,040
starvation and they actually were

322
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
able to sway the outcome of the election

323
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,839
this was so effective that they actually

324
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,680
repeated this process

325
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,839
in multiple countries including

326
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,000
guatemala

327
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
south vietnam afghanistan

328
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,560
indonesia and many

329
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,040
many more

330
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
another example is uh moscow

331
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,440
where they actually founded the

332
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,519
communist international party in

333
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,560
1919 and they used that to urge

334
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
the american communist party to pursue

335
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
revolutionary regime change in the

336
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
united states

337
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
this can be considered very similar to

338
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
the democracy promotion later pursued by

339
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,040
washington

340
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,399
and while this isn't a direct

341
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,760
impact on an election

342
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,639
the goal is to sway that belief system

343
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:34,959
for

344
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
future elections and to push that point

345
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,600
of view

346
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,120
another example that crosses several

347
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
lines is

348
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,279
the 1996 chinese influence on the us

349
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,000
election

350
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,720
where a chinese general sent three

351
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,800
hundred thousand dollars

352
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,519
to the clinton campaign because they

353
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,440
were interested in influencing the u.s

354
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,480
presidential election

355
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,959
now let's look at some more modern

356
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,399
attacks and we'll start with social

357
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,639
media

358
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,440
on the right we have an example here of

359
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,760
in

360
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,279
facebook ad um or facebook post

361
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,040
where someone is talking about who's

362
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
behind the mask like and share if you

363
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,600
want

364
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,880
the burka band in america the goal is

365
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
really to push this message

366
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,079
of divisiveness and to make people feel

367
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,760
like this is a common sentiment

368
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,800
in the us whether or not it is on the

369
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,680
left

370
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,360
you can see what's both a

371
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,000
ethos attack and an information attack

372
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,079
because it is a twitter post

373
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,600
saying uh save time avoid the line vote

374
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,399
from home

375
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,000
which of course you cannot vote from

376
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
home but

377
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,519
people might take this and say oh the

378
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,199
government is being so helpful

379
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,720
we can now vote from home we don't have

380
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
to go in especially during times of a

381
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,040
pandemic this could be very helpful

382
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,600
when in reality this does not actually

383
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,639
this is not a way to vote

384
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,320
and you know one of the problems that i

385
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,079
want to highlight here

386
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,839
is we're seeing companies that are

387
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,880
justifying

388
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,680
misinformation and disinformation as

389
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,360
free speech

390
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,399
and it does the way that the argument is

391
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,519
framed

392
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,240
makes it seem like this is a fair point

393
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,880
but

394
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,079
the reality of the situation is that we

395
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,040
are struggling

396
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,160
in many countries to

397
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,519
handle misinformation and disinformation

398
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,120
and it is so vast and so important

399
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,000
that it is more than just a government

400
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,800
issue

401
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
and social responsibility

402
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,040
for these individual organizations needs

403
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,839
to be

404
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,399
paramount

405
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
next we're going to look at the

406
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
information plane and some historical

407
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,839
examples from that

408
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,920
and this one is particularly interesting

409
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,519
because i want to start off by talking

410
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,160
about the foundations of america

411
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,839
specifically sam adams and

412
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,240
disinformation

413
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
now disinformation and misinformation

414
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:12,880
they're obviously not

415
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,160
new ideas but it was baffling to me to

416
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,639
learn

417
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,839
the depths to which they are very

418
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,560
much so not new ideas america was

419
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,279
actually

420
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,680
founded on the premise of a conspiracy

421
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,959
theory

422
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,040
sam adams argued that britain's

423
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,959
taxations were part of an elaborate

424
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,959
conspiracy to eventually enslave

425
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,079
american colonists

426
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,680
spread that and other early

427
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
disinformation through pamphlets and

428
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,839
speeches that contained information

429
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,880
he knew was untrue but continued to

430
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,839
spread it

431
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,639
in order to gain power in order to

432
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,279
spread

433
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,160
the the type of thinking that he wanted

434
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,519
to spread

435
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,720
and he actually used the boston

436
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920
boston massacre to that end as well

437
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,639
so when we think about disinformation

438
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,160
especially in the united states but in

439
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,679
other countries as well

440
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,480
we need to consider the fact that one

441
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
this is not something new

442
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,520
is not a new problem and two

443
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,199
some of our countries were founded on

444
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,119
this which

445
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,839
is something that it makes you

446
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,880
reconsider

447
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,039
how you view this information in the

448
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:23,919
world and

449
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,280
where we're starting from

450
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,799
next i also want to talk about the cia

451
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,000
and the propaganda

452
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,559
asset inventory this was in the 1950s

453
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,360
and 60s during the cold war era

454
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,039
um there were a lot of different radio

455
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,120
stations and magazines and

456
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,720
newspapers that the u.s um the cia was

457
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
in control of

458
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
in a particularly interesting instance

459
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,480
as you can see with these balloons

460
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,520
um the cia was

461
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,039
in control of radio free asia and

462
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
they realized that many

463
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,880
taiwanese citizens did not have access

464
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,080
to a radio as

465
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
private citizens so they actually

466
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,760
strapped radios two balloons in an

467
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,080
attempt to fly them over to taiwan

468
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,400
so that citizens would get access to the

469
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,640
radio needless to say

470
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
the balloons went the wrong direction

471
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,559
but the story is interesting

472
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,799
just for the fact that they tried this

473
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,520
and then also um another interesting

474
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,080
story

475
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,559
is a magazine that the cia actually had

476
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,520
control of called forum world features

477
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,400
and the magazine became so popular that

478
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,799
they

479
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,120
started to distribute it in the u.s so

480
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,280
the cia had to be very careful not to

481
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
accidentally place

482
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,520
false stories in the u.s magazine

483
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,320
very disturbing

484
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,840
and of course hardly a left-wing

485
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,039
newspaper in europe

486
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,720
wasn't financed directly from moscow

487
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,360
this was again in the 1950s 60s and 70s

488
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,799
another example is u.s radio in moscow

489
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,360
from

490
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,600
the time of 1976 to 1982.

491
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,799
a lot of rock music which was not

492
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,760
available in moscow the um the us would

493
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,480
actually

494
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
stream on this radio station things like

495
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,960
elton john the beatles

496
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,000
and they spent a lot of time playing

497
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,640
this music

498
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,559
and then on the breaks they would follow

499
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,400
it up with quote unquote editorial

500
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
content

501
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
which soviet authorities consider

502
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,039
disinformation

503
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
but people still listen to it in russia

504
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,480
because they wanted the music

505
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
now this one is particularly interesting

506
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
because it is an actual example

507
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,400
from election day where faith in

508
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,240
um the election was attacked

509
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,880
so three or four days before the

510
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,919
election

511
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,640
in ukraine the um

512
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,120
attackers actually compromised the cec

513
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
network

514
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
so they were able to disable vote

515
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,320
counting and this is immediately

516
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,640
losing faith in your government losing

517
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
faith in how effectively your government

518
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,760
is going to be able to count the votes

519
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,880
of this election

520
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
and the actual integrity of the election

521
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,200
they were able to get it back up and

522
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
running in about 12 hours

523
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,480
but still a few days later on

524
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,640
actual election day this was may 25th in

525
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,159
2014

526
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,360
they um underwent a

527
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
constant denial of service attack on the

528
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,440
cec website

529
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,360
and actually 12 minutes before the polls

530
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
closed

531
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
attackers posted a picture of the former

532
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,799
leader

533
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,000
of the right sector on the cec website

534
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
claiming that he won the election which

535
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,360
was then shared

536
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,720
widely by russian media almost as if it

537
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,440
was planned

538
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,440
almost now let's look at

539
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,919
some of these attacks on communication

540
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,039
that are more

541
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,240
uh modern and

542
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,280
we're seeing in the 2016 election and

543
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,640
um frequently even now

544
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,559
on the right hand side you can see this

545
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,400
helpful message supposedly coming from

546
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,880
the us government that is giving someone

547
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
their polling location however

548
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,840
this is not an illegitimate polling

549
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
location they're trying to send someone

550
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
to the wrong place

551
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,919
because ultimately if you get sent to

552
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,120
the wrong place

553
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,919
and it makes you late for work you're

554
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,360
probably going to be frustrated you're

555
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,960
probably not going to want to

556
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
try and find where your actual polling

557
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
location is

558
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
and then on the left you can see an

559
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,480
example of

560
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,400
um a message supposedly coming from

561
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,280
president trump

562
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,600
saying that your ballot has not yet been

563
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,679
submitted

564
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,320
this is uh a tactic used to shame

565
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,440
someone from vote

566
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
to voting and it's not actually from the

567
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,039
campaign

568
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,679
now let's look at the infrastructure

569
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,799
plan this one

570
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,799
is my favorite i think it's super

571
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,320
interesting the connection between

572
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,200
cyber security and actual physical

573
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
installments

574
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
so um there are quite a few examples in

575
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,320
here and we'll start again with those

576
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,240
historical ones

577
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,679
first let's talk about an assassination

578
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,559
um

579
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,440
of lumumba so the democratic republic of

580
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,880
congo

581
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,000
was created and uh gained its

582
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
independence

583
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,039
in 1960. at that time

584
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,000
lumumba was elected as the prime

585
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
minister

586
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,000
and he was shortly after

587
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,159
he was assassinated in 1961.

588
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,640
now while this was not directly related

589
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,120
to an election

590
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,840
it was politically fracturing for this

591
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,240
new

592
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,720
independent nation and it was actually

593
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,000
put on

594
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,760
the assassination was put on by the

595
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,280
american and belgian governments

596
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,799
this is the type of thing that can

597
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,120
really strongly impact people's faith

598
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,000
in their elections faith in their

599
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,039
government

600
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,120
and like fear that

601
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,799
they can have their own opinions or be

602
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,640
taken seriously or run for office and

603
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,360
not be killed

604
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,240
and let's talk about another example in

605
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,520
1965 where

606
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,840
the communist party actually finished

607
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,720
fourth in an

608
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,080
indonesian election they were offered

609
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
a proportional representation in the

610
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
government

611
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,720
as is typical but the us was not

612
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,159
happy about this they did not feel like

613
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,679
um having communists even

614
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,440
having a proportional representation in

615
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
government would be good for

616
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,000
western interests and so they secretly

617
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
supported the purge of

618
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
suspected communists and thousands to

619
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
millions of people

620
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,679
died over months the military then took

621
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,679
over as the most powerful institution in

622
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,640
the country

623
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
and this is the type of thing that

624
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,279
obviously has immediate impact because

625
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,960
people have been killed

626
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,840
but it also terrifies the public who is

627
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,799
voting freely

628
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,480
in their country after something like

629
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,760
this happens that's the question

630
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,679
and while it may not be directly

631
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,799
related to cyber security at this point

632
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,000
think about how much easier it is to

633
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,120
secretly support and push for

634
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,600
the purging of a specific group in a

635
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,640
country

636
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
when you have access to disinformation

637
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
campaigns misinformation campaigns over

638
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
the internet that can be done very

639
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,080
covertly

640
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
and next i want to talk about the bronze

641
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,080
night this again was not on election day

642
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,720
but gives a great example of what could

643
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,200
happen

644
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,520
on election day tying in those physical

645
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
aspects with the cyber aspects

646
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,799
so the bronze night

647
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,760
was a day in estonia where they actually

648
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,320
moved

649
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,520
a red army soldier to a soviet cemetery

650
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
instead of being in the center of

651
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,799
um the capital and

652
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
because they didn't want to have a red

653
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,760
army soldier in the middle of their

654
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,960
capital which i think makes a lot of

655
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,919
sense

656
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,120
anyway fake news started to spread

657
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
with russian news reports claiming that

658
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
the statue and soviet war graves were

659
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,080
being destroyed while this was happening

660
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
and this resulted in two nights of riots

661
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,120
and looting

662
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,000
156 people were injured one person died

663
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,440
and

664
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,720
a thousand people were detained

665
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
but at the same time on the

666
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
infrastructure side

667
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,440
banks media outlets and government and

668
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,159
the government

669
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,679
was um hit by a denial of service attack

670
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,919
so that meant that cash machines in

671
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,520
online banking was completely out of

672
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,480
service

673
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
government employees were unable to

674
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,520
communicate via email

675
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,600
and newspapers and broadcasters were

676
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,360
completely unable to deliver the news

677
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
this is the type of attack that really

678
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,880
combines that infrastructure and

679
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,400
information

680
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,440
plane in order to

681
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,799
cause a lot of chaos cause injury and in

682
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,880
some cases death

683
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,840
and just wreak havoc on the government

684
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,240
and

685
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,520
the individual citizens

686
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
as this quote i think this quote really

687
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,720
um

688
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,840
represents this idea that

689
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,080
cyber is really it just spreads

690
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,480
confusion covertly

691
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,919
you don't even see it and but you can

692
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:52,960
incite people

693
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,400
and incite different things in order to

694
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
further your message

695
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,080
now with physical attacks in modern

696
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
times we can look at things like the

697
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,600
electric grid this is one of the ones

698
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,039
that

699
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,880
i find very potentially scary

700
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,120
for example in 2003 a four-day power

701
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,400
outage left at least

702
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
100 people in the united states and

703
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,279
canada dad

704
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,120
if there is a power outage happening in

705
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,080
your

706
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,039
city or in your specific district or

707
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,120
whatever the case may be

708
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
you are going to be more worried about

709
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
what's going bad in your fridge then you

710
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,120
are

711
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,640
going out to vote and some people this

712
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,240
is not the case for some people will

713
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
want still want to go out and vote

714
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,919
but in reality you have a lot more

715
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,399
priorities in this situation

716
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,360
than going to vote

717
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,520
and next on that physical side i want to

718
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:55,919
look at

719
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,960
transit because it if you are unable to

720
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,200
actually get to a polling place

721
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,559
with public transit or your car or

722
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,320
whatever the case may be

723
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,080
it makes it a lot more difficult to want

724
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,039
to go and vote

725
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,880
let's not forget in 2016 when san

726
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
francisco's transit system was infected

727
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,520
with ransomware

728
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,679
now if something like this happened say

729
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,880
it's a normal day

730
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,960
we're not doing a pandemic and you go

731
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,880
um you go to work you take public

732
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,960
transit to work

733
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
you spend your day reading the news

734
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
potentially accidentally reading some

735
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
disinformation

736
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,279
and you reach the end of the day and

737
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,960
your plan is to go

738
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,840
take the train to the polling station on

739
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,279
your way home

740
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,760
but you go to the train and the train is

741
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
shut down because of a ransomware attack

742
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,360
or a denial terrorist attack or whatever

743
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,200
the case may be

744
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,039
are you gonna still try to go to the

745
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,960
post office or still try to go to the

746
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
polling station excuse me

747
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,679
or are you going to give up be

748
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,039
frustrated

749
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,039
and just go home because you've had a

750
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,399
long day of work

751
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,159
and it feels like the day should be over

752
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,159
anyway

753
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,640
a lot of people would take that as a

754
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,840
sign that they should not go

755
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,919
so what we're seeing is we can attack

756
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,200
each layer in order to

757
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,159
actually attack every part of the voter

758
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,840
hierarchy of needs

759
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,640
now let's shift back to the defender

760
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,240
perspective to think about where this

761
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,279
actually leaves us

762
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,240
and in the united states right now and

763
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,159
in many countries right now we continue

764
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:40,640
to have

765
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,320
this very narrow view of election

766
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,880
security where election infrastructure

767
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,240
is limited to voter registration

768
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,279
databases

769
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,200
voter registration databases i.t

770
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
infrastructure etc

771
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,120
this leads to things like this uh public

772
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,640
officials coming out and saying

773
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,679
that we are just gonna have to confront

774
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,399
distortions and fake stories

775
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,919
presidents saying that they're trying to

776
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,399
steal

777
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,919
an election and this is a huge scam

778
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,559
and even top congressional democrats

779
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,039
saying

780
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,360
that this information is going to be

781
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,960
amplified during this election and we

782
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,760
need to be prepared for it

783
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,799
and while it's great to be

784
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,399
publicly releasing these statements

785
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,279
it doesn't give voters the tools that

786
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,320
they need

787
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,360
to prevent it it's making a statement oh

788
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,799
by the way we're going to be struggling

789
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,159
with all of this stuff

790
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,080
but we have no solution for you we have

791
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,000
no way for you

792
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,640
to actually not have to deal with

793
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,360
something like this

794
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,240
so the question is given everything that

795
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,679
you've learned today in this talk

796
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,159
where should we really be going what

797
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,640
should election security look like

798
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,720
in order to actually take into account

799
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
all of the different aspects that we've

800
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
been talking about

801
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,320
and this is how i view it i view

802
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,559
election security as a combination of

803
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,120
things

804
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,679
like defending communication defending

805
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,640
social media

806
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,799
transit the electric grid and other

807
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,840
different things

808
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,880
in order to give a more like

809
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,399
holistic and complete view

810
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,480
of election security and in order to

811
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,519
give voters

812
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,760
much more confidence in their ability to

813
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,360
vote during election day

814
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,880
now uh there is an interactive portion

815
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,559
of this exercise

816
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,679
so i want you guys to think about

817
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,320
what your election day looks like and

818
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,760
i'll start from my side by just

819
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,960
answering these questions

820
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,159
i do vote before work which makes it

821
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,000
super convenient because i just get up

822
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,440
it's the first thing i do in the day and

823
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,039
i feel accomplished

824
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,000
but this year i am actually going to

825
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,440
mail on a ballot

826
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,200
i've applied for mail in voting i'm a

827
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,840
huge supporter of mail in voting

828
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,440
especially right now given the current

829
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,200
circumstances

830
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,679
it obviously comes with its own threat

831
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,880
model

832
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,000
but the importance of

833
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,640
preparation and thinking ahead and

834
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,279
removing

835
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,039
the ability to make these time-based

836
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,600
attacks is key

837
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
now of course modern events do change

838
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,200
this i do not want to wait in a polling

839
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,080
station

840
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,039
when people could be sick and i am on

841
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:23,679
twitter

842
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,960
and i do try to fact check as often as i

843
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,360
can

844
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
unless it's from a trusted source and

845
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,720
then i may not

846
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,960
but the majority of times i do and i

847
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,919
look for

848
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,519
um certain things and and say

849
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,840
well this doesn't seem realistic well

850
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,679
this is telling it as if there's only

851
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,039
one side to the story

852
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,679
things like that

853
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,159
so how would you attack what would you

854
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,120
do to each of these layers

855
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,039
would you take out the electric grid in

856
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,679
specific areas that are known to swing

857
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,640
republican or democrat

858
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,159
would you um take out

859
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,279
transit in as many districts as possible

860
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,480
what are the different things that you

861
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,679
would do which layers would you attack

862
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,000
and then i want you to use that

863
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,640
brainstorm

864
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,360
to think about how you can actually

865
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,559
protect it both

866
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,880
at a citizen level at an organization

867
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,200
level and at a government level

868
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,559
how would you actually defend democracy

869
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,640
given these new constraints around what

870
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,399
election security truly means

871
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,960
and i want to leave you guys with

872
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
some thoughts on how what we can do to

873
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,240
protect

874
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,440
democracy because

875
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,399
it in a lot of ways it seems like a

876
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,080
problem that we don't have much control

877
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,960
over

878
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,720
but i would argue that that is not the

879
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,200
case because a lot of these different

880
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,880
forms of election

881
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,960
election security infrastructure in this

882
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,039
new definition

883
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,760
are privately owned so whether you're in

884
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,480
the government

885
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,279
or in the private sector you need to

886
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,279
take security seriously

887
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,320
examples of that are social media many

888
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
um social media well all social media

889
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,399
networks in the us at least

890
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,520
are owned by private companies and they

891
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,760
need to be taking security seriously

892
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,800
similarly some

893
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,918
utilities are privately owned in the

894
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,320
united states and in other countries

895
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,679
and some forms of transit as well

896
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,440
all of these need people need to take

897
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,599
security seriously

898
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,280
in order to defend election day and

899
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,000
so a part of that is to work closely

900
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,960
with the government

901
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,040
develop relationships if you aren't a

902
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
member of infragard

903
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,918
but you work at a critical

904
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,079
infrastructure provider i highly

905
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,440
recommend that you join

906
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,159
it's a public private partnership with

907
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,440
the us government

908
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,599
if you're in the us and try to look it

909
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,520
up if you're not in the us

910
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,000
what your country does to interface

911
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,720
between the public and private sector

912
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,520
and then the last one is to do what you

913
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:07,920
can

914
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,359
to fight misinformation post things

915
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,480
factually

916
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,200
don't retweet things that are fake news

917
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,599
um try to read up on

918
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,640
situations and modern life and

919
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
everything going on in politics so that

920
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,240
you can be the voice

921
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,599
of truth in a world that is

922
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,079
very tied to falsehoods

923
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,000
now i've created a um a white paper on

924
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,880
