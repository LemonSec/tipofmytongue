00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,360
thank you very much for our first talk

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
in our track two

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,480
well welcome we are we are introducing

7
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,520
yourself please

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,479
thank you thank you for having me on

9
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,519
hola

10
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
my spanish is terrible these days i

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,439
haven't practiced for a long time but i

12
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:09,920
got

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
all that i understood it at least

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
um hi everyone and today we're going to

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
dive into hacker rides

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,240
there will be moments where this is

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,520
going to be a little bit more u.s

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
centric but please note that

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
chances are that might be applicable to

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,040
you as well

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,159
so let's dive into this so

22
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,079
i just want to first say that this talk

23
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
is completely dedicated to

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,159
those who have ever had to disclose

25
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,439
anything

26
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,119
um who also are have been prosecuted for

27
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,640
trying to do something good or just

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,079
doing their job

29
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,600
um to all the people who are in the

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,960
fight to bring rights for hackers

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,399
because there's a lot of us behind the

32
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,880
scenes

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,360
all right so if you don't know who i am

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,799
once again my name is columbus

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,399
i'm the vp of strategy over at 0.3

36
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,000
security and when i'm not doing that i'm

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,479
also an

38
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,040
ethical hacker advocate i'm trying to

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,159
push for rights for

40
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
us and by working with other

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,878
organizations and persons to try to push

42
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,000
out

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
and change the public perception of

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
hackers and what we do

45
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
i'm also the person and co-founder of

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
wosek and the founder of we are hackers

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
formerly known as womanhackers

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
a podcaster for itsp magazine the

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
uncommon journey with phil wiley and

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,920
alyssa miller

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
and also a hacker book club organizer

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,519
basically we read a book every month and

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,879
it's usually written by someone in the

54
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
hacking community

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
and basically the author and those

56
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
mentioned in the book do attend our

57
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,120
sessions

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
um it's every tuesday at 5 pm pacific

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
time so feel free to join us anytime we

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
are right now reading tribal packers red

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
team

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,239
um that is my url and that is my twitter

63
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,760
and instagram if you want to know

64
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,519
anything about me it's most likely on

65
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,319
that website

66
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,480
and also my twitter and instagram feel

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,760
free to follow my dms are always open

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,560
now let's get into the real stuff here

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,159
so this is going to be kind of scary

70
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,000
at times but we're going to dive in it

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,319
together

72
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,959
so you probably remember equifax the

73
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,239
bridge and whatnot but

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,640
did you know a hacker warned equifax

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,319
that it was vulnerable to the kind of

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,080
attack that later compromised

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
the personal data of more than 147

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,159
million americans

79
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,640
and this was reported by motherboard six

80
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,239
months after the researcher first

81
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,440
notified the company about the

82
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
vulnerability equifax finally passed it

83
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,120
but only after the massive breach that

84
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,319
made headlines

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,480
had already taken place according to

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,518
their own timeline

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,680
or perhaps you remember the capital one

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,920
breach which is basically

89
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
according to the federal complaint the

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
breach took place in the stages across

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,080
march and april 2019 the capital one

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
only became of the problem

93
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
on july 17th when a security researcher

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
tipped the company to a public github

95
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,959
page

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,080
that was displaying something that

97
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
looked an awful lot like

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,840
capital one private data

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
but the real question is well what if no

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
one reported the breach

101
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
and unfortunately this happens often

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
because hackers don't report a breach

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,720
due to the fear of prosecution

104
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,799
so 60 researchers don't report

105
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,399
vulnerabilities and this was a statistic

106
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,320
that was discovered by emit hel

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
elisari who knows that our laws

108
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,519
basically prevent

109
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,759
good hackers from doing what they do

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
best protecting you and me

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,759
and everyone that we love she's been

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,639
spearheading

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
into the conversation of safe harbor but

114
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
also hacker once 2018

115
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,000
hacker report surveyed 1698 members of

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,880
the hacking

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,440
community and in that survey itself i

118
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,120
found that almost one in four

119
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,919
hackers have not reported vulnerability

120
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,520
because of the company in question

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,080
didn't have

122
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,720
a bdp which is a early disclosure

123
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,759
program

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,639
those try to notify the company through

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,000
other channels such as email

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
or social media also claimed they were

127
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,680
frequently

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,199
ignored or misunderstood

129
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,759
so why are hackers scared well besides

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
the prosecution looking for the contact

131
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
info reading the policies that have been

132
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
burdened to report vulnerabilities think

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,039
about it sometimes it takes us

134
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,360
hours sometimes days and then it comes

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,639
weeks and then we're just like

136
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,199
is it even worth it to find the right

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
contact information to disclose

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,880
anything and perhaps they are hired to

139
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,000
be a hacker

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
and everything but they can still get

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,120
prosecuted too

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,400
if not everything is in check and i want

143
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,120
to go over

144
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,919
a couple cases with you so this one is

145
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,199
via dg

146
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,360
ji which as you noticed that drone

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,960
manufacturer well they basically

148
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,639
launched their own bug bounding program

149
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,919
in other words they didn't go to hacker

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,280
one by carsonic

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
to do their bug batting program they

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,440
basically did it in house one

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,800
um so two researchers uh sean and kevin

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
basically found their bug battery

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
program and wanted to double check on

156
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,440
their scope before reporting anything

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
so for their scope their bug buying

158
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
program covers all the security issues

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,680
and firmware

160
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
application servers include source code

161
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
link

162
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,840
security workaround privacy issues and

163
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,880
kevin he wants to

164
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
just confirm once again and keep a paper

165
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
trail of the scope

166
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
to make sure that he was safe it took

167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
them about two weeks to respond to him

168
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,000
to finally confirm

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
what is in scope he then reported the

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,120
vulnerability

171
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
and he's provided about three thousand

172
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,479
dollars for this fighting

173
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,039
however the agreement of receiving the

174
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:29,840
funds

175
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,560
offered no protection for himself

176
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
because of that

177
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,479
he decided to walk away the revelations

178
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,759
resulted in the company

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,319
challenging his findings and seemingly

180
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,360
threatening him

181
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
with a lawsuit tied to the computer

182
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
fraud abuse act also cfaa

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
claiming he went out of scope regardless

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,319
of the fact he made sure to confirm the

185
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,520
scope

186
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,479
and in return because of this he posted

187
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,720
the entire conversations

188
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,680
um publicly with dji and they finally

189
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,039
dropped it because of it

190
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199
it was a really bad pr thing for them

191
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,160
but overall

192
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,919
one thing to take away is keep a paper

193
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,520
trail one

194
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,599
the second thing is read it if you want

195
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,720
to have some

196
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,120
to see the reality of what happens in

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
some of the email trainings itself

198
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,440
you actually see internal conversations

199
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,000
happening

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
and they claim that he was a risk a

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
liability for them and this could be bad

202
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,280
pr for them

203
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,240
so they started to sue him because of it

204
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,280
it didn't turn out well for them clearly

205
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
another case is this with the two coal

206
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
fire employees you may have heard about

207
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
it but in september the iowa state asked

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,319
the cyber security

209
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,639
firm coal fire to conduct a penetration

210
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
test to see if its staff could gain

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,840
access into sense of data or equipment

212
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,160
so the two coal fire employees found a

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
door to the dallas courthouse

214
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
open and when they closed the door to

215
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,039
see if it would lock

216
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,960
and then attempted to open it the alarm

217
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,479
actually went off

218
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
following the protocol the employees

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,479
wait for the police arrive and

220
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
showed them their paperwork and

221
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,919
initially they were like

222
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,800
good to go however a sheriff showed up

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,840
and was like

224
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,479
no no we need to arrest them so they

225
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
showed the evidence that they were hired

226
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,879
and everything

227
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,280
they were still being arrested they

228
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
didn't have to spend a night in jail

229
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,840
the charges were later dropped of this

230
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,599
year in january

231
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,840
but it's one of those other examples how

232
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,000
you can even be doing your job and

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
doing everything you're supposed to be

234
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
doing but still have to face

235
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,120
possibly getting prosecuted

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,719
and i mean overall community consensus

237
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,799
is is that language of what's in scope

238
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,240
out of scope when disclosing or how

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,120
disclosed can be

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
really scary and also the potential

241
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,440
indictments especially

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,519
it can keep everyone up at night and

243
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,040
that's even program managers they're

244
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
asking to get hacked but they're not

245
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
asking to get hacked badly

246
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,959
they also have struggle sometimes of how

247
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,800
to conduct and handle situations when

248
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
researchers report something

249
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,640
they don't keep them up to date on it

250
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,880
and as us when we submit something we

251
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
kind of want to be updated about what's

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
going on

253
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
but in the reality all the organizations

254
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,200
out there

255
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
and government knows they probably need

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,519
a disclosure program

257
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
at this time because believe it or not

258
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,800
it's going to keep them safe too

259
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,360
and i know this is a scary subject so

260
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
here are a bunch of puppies and i did

261
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
put a cat in there for the cat lovers

262
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
to see if you guys can find spot

263
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,040
anyway all right let's continue now

264
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,360
so why are they scared of us so why is

265
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
the public scared of us you guys

266
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
and the reality is that even though

267
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,959
hackers are

268
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,360
are not attackers they're not malicious

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,320
actors and whatnot

270
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
they're still being seen and treated as

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,160
such um because this it reduces the

272
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,000
chance of report a vulnerability and can

273
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,920
cause hackers to go on the dark side

274
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
because they're seen as the same

275
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
so this is what happens when you type in

276
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,279
criminal hackers to the left and this is

277
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,880
what you see when you type in ethical

278
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
hikers to the right

279
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,279
once again is this hoodie darkness and

280
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,880
sometimes with a ski mask which is

281
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
really annoying

282
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
but it's not just the imagery that we're

283
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
also focusing on

284
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
it's also language used in the media and

285
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,240
when i say media

286
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,880
it's referring to marketing and pr

287
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,079
um you know otherwise the press

288
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,800
um so the thing is is that by using the

289
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,360
term

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,040
hacker to describe someone who's

291
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,600
actually committing a crime

292
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
um it's basically it's putting us in a

293
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
bad situation that

294
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,920
we can't even use the term hacker

295
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,279
because people think of us

296
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,480
as bad and criminal people and so that's

297
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
really a bad thing because if you think

298
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,040
about it

299
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,440
they should be using the term attacker

300
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,959
or cyber criminal

301
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,000
or just flat out criminal but

302
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,399
the thing is is that the imagery and

303
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,360
language does

304
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,399
impact us it impacts us so much because

305
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,640
it continues to fear

306
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
um basically have this idea that people

307
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,680
should be afraid of us

308
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,519
and that's not what it's supposed to be

309
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,000
about we're we're here to support them

310
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
we're supposed to protect them

311
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
from attackers we're there to protect

312
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
them every day behind scenes but they

313
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,079
don't know that

314
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,160
and that's the problem we have is that

315
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,399
we have these stereotypes and biases

316
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,320
that exist your social construction

317
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,240
beliefs

318
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
and if you're wondering chloe what are

319
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,680
socially constructed beliefs

320
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
oh don't worry we're getting into it

321
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,880
next

322
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,399
and some of you guys know every time i

323
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
give a presentation and anything

324
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,480
i always bring up the brain because it's

325
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,760
really important to know is

326
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,320
how human behavior works so we're able

327
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
to fix the situation but

328
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,680
also have a better understanding in the

329
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
world that we live in

330
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,959
and how humans react is something

331
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,240
important for us now

332
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,279
anyway so we're going to dive into a

333
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,440
couple things so understand how fear

334
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,000
works

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,720
and how socially constructed beliefs

336
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,279
impact

337
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,760
us so first things first if you don't

338
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
know a socially constructed belief

339
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,200
it's basically the ideas and beliefs and

340
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,839
that you have picked up since growing up

341
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,600
or even when you're an adult

342
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,160
so this could be images on the tv this

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
could be things that you read in the

344
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
in the news this could be things that

345
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,959
you see images

346
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,839
of um but basically it sets you up to

347
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,200
understanding more about the world you

348
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,079
live in

349
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,519
and so one of the things you need to

350
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,200
understand is that there is a part of

351
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440
your brain called the amygdala

352
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
it's a very small almond shaped tissue

353
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,720
that's

354
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
inside your temporal lobe which is

355
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,399
responsible for your emotions

356
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,200
also for your memories and whatnot the

357
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
thing is is that the amigo is completely

358
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,079
subconscious

359
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,360
but it was created in your brain to have

360
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,200
a survival mechanism

361
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,639
so it basically is sorting who's like me

362
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,519
who's not like me and based on that in

363
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,079
itself

364
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,000
it lets us know who we should feel

365
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,519
threatened by

366
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,200
so it's usually if you hear the

367
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
mentality you hear this fight versus

368
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
flight mechanism

369
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,920
um and that's basically what it is it's

370
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,000
sorting who's like me who's not like me

371
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,880
so i can be preventative and take the

372
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
right actions to protect myself

373
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
because if the person's not like me

374
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
they're a stranger

375
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,760
danger in other words they're the enemy

376
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,519
and so one of the things to think about

377
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,040
here in this part

378
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,959
is that when people are seeing the

379
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,399
images of

380
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,480
of hackers being in a basement with a

381
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
hoodie on

382
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,720
or just basically hearing in the news

383
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,040
that

384
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,839
hackers are bad people they're they're

385
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,839
causing breaches they're taking your

386
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,240
your information they're utilizing it to

387
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,920
make money off of you

388
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
they're taking away your privacy and

389
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,199
whatnot

390
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,360
the thing is is that all that imagery

391
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
and all that language

392
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,199
what it's actually doing it's creating

393
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
the socially constructed belief

394
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,639
that those folks are criminals

395
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,720
so we are criminals and you might have

396
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
seen this before where

397
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,079
you go to an event and you tell someone

398
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,519
you're a hacker

399
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,959
and they take a step back like wait

400
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,199
what or they don't even say anything and

401
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,399
their eyes get bigger

402
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,120
or um they basically just kind of freak

403
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,880
out in that moment internally but you

404
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,600
could totally see it on their face

405
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,079
and that's that's because that they have

406
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,360
been conditioned to

407
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,839
feel threatened by us and because of

408
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,480
that

409
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,959
it has created fear from images and

410
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,680
language

411
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,160
and so your amygdala which is your

412
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,199
emotional response basically then sends

413
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,160
a message

414
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
to your prefrontal cortex to let it know

415
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,199
that it's a threat so for example if

416
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:39,600
you're

417
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
taught at some point that people with

418
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
pink care are dangerous individuals

419
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
when you see someone with pink hair you

420
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
might hold your purse a little bit

421
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,160
closer you might cross the street

422
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
you might like going to another place

423
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,440
because you just

424
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
have believed all around you that people

425
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
think are dangerous

426
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
so your mcdonald always sends a message

427
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,000
to the

428
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
mental part of your brain to let it know

429
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,199
or i need

430
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,880
warning this could be a criminal

431
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,839
taken now the thing to note about the

432
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,519
amygdala is completely subconscious

433
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,160
however

434
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
it becomes consciously aware in your

435
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,199
brain

436
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,959
that you need to take a step or an

437
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,279
action when the megalith sends a message

438
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,760
to the prefrontal cortex of your brain

439
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,240
now your prefrontal cortex asks like a

440
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,880
ceo

441
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
it's verifying the threats it's

442
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
basically trying to figure out

443
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,759
is this actually a threat or not and

444
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,519
this is based on logic

445
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,720
this is based on storytelling too so

446
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
say for example because the person like

447
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,639
saw pink hair

448
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,920
knows that pink hair people are

449
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,759
dangerous or whatnot they hold their bag

450
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,480
closer

451
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,959
or they get off the elevator sooner

452
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,320
because they always assume that the

453
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,199
person with

454
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,160
pink hair is dangerous now the thing is

455
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
though is that it can always be

456
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,720
challenged

457
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,160
so this is the time when you can

458
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
challenge any socially constructed

459
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,320
belief you have

460
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
at every time so the thing is is that

461
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
okay so

462
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
um say you watched a youtube video and

463
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,240
in that youtube video itself

464
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,839
it was someone with pink hair talking

465
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,839
about how hard it is

466
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,240
in their life because no matter where

467
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
they go

468
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
people see them as criminals and they

469
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,880
always see them like holding their purse

470
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,399
a little bit closer or crossing the

471
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,120
street

472
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,920
or going to somewhere else and to avoid

473
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,880
them because they

474
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,079
see them as a threat and how much that

475
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,720
impacts that person with pink hair

476
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,959
so say for example you saw that video

477
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,320
the person with pink hair

478
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,360
explain how horrible it is to be them

479
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
because everyone's always seeing them as

480
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,920
someone who's going to do something bad

481
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,480
and how much that impacted them so the

482
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,600
next time

483
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
when you see someone walking with pink

484
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,880
hair

485
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
and your amygdala is sending a signal to

486
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,240
the prefrontal cortex saying

487
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
warning warning person of danger at that

488
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
moment

489
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
you also are remembered that video that

490
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,560
you saw on youtube of the personality

491
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,440
care explained

492
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
how hard it is to be that person because

493
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
everyone sees them as a criminal

494
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
because everyone clutches their back a

495
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
little bit closer so say for example you

496
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,760
usually would have clutched your back a

497
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,720
little bit closer

498
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,039
but now since you saw that video you're

499
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,079
kind of checking in

500
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,799
and being like you know what maybe this

501
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,000
isn't a threat

502
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
i saw that video and i think i need to

503
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,039
not do that so the thing is to note is

504
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,599
that

505
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,480
the most important thing is that you can

506
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,039
always

507
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,480
challenge biases stereotypes and whatnot

508
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,960
or socially constructive beliefs you

509
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,080
just have to work

510
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,559
at it and that's the one takeaway i want

511
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,480
to tell you guys is about is that

512
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,120
even if society sees hackers as bad

513
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,840
people

514
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,200
remember there's a difference between an

515
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,520
attacker and a hacker but a hacker is a

516
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,799
good person right

517
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,799
who's not trying to do anything going

518
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,960
out of scope and exploiting right

519
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
so the thing is to know is

520
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,600
in that moment people can challenge

521
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
their beliefs of who we

522
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,679
are and by hearing our stories and us

523
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
correcting the press

524
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,679
and trying to change the norm of how

525
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,480
people view

526
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
us it's actually possible it it's

527
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
definitely possible to change people's

528
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,720
fear

529
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
they just have to hear us and have to

530
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,240
also be open

531
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
to being okay with being wrong

532
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,640
one of those things humans we don't like

533
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
to be wrong right because it makes us

534
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,039
feel

535
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,600
inadequate to present but the most

536
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
important thing is that

537
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,799
it's the one takeaway from this entire

538
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,400
talk is that change

539
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
is possible here getting rights for

540
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,160
hackers is possible

541
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,559
even with people that saw us or still

542
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,240
see us as criminals

543
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,400
when they hear our stories and they

544
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
everything starts shifting and the

545
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,520
narrative starts shifting

546
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,200
in the way that really represents who we

547
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,679
are that's when we're able to move

548
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,960
forward and gain rights

549
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,880
so the reason why we have to do this

550
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,960
and change the mindset of the public is

551
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,000
because

552
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
this mindset set by society by people in

553
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
the media it's keeping

554
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
us unsafe and preventing us what we do

555
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,640
well

556
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
in and right now because of how the

557
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,320
public

558
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,440
sees us and views us

559
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,039
the problem is is that companies are

560
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,960
still afraid of having a vulnerability

561
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,799
disclosure program

562
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
i mean even 94 percent of the forbes

563
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,720
global 2000

564
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,039
still don't have a vdp which is

565
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,679
something you may come to regret because

566
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
we need everyone to help them out and to

567
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,280
report things when they see a

568
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,360
vulnerability

569
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,200
and the reason is that companies are

570
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
afraid of hackers

571
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
they don't want to create vulnerability

572
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,960
disclosure policies and because of

573
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,440
lack of bilateral trust amongst hackers

574
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
and organizations and government

575
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,679
some of the reasons why 60 still don't

576
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,280
report a vulnerability

577
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,039
hackers are scared of these outdated

578
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,559
laws in cfa

579
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,280
and dmca but also from interviewing

580
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,799
attackers themselves

581
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,640
one of the reasons they decide to move

582
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,360
away from ethical hacking

583
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,159
is the pay and the constant worried of

584
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,880
being

585
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
prosecuted regardless that they were

586
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,120
within scope and they didn't exploit

587
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
it's something that keeps them up at

588
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,799
night and because of that

589
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,960
that's the reason why they're like well

590
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,120
if i'm gonna already be seen as the

591
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,520
enemy to everyone i might as well be the

592
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
enemy to everyone

593
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
and this is terrible because this could

594
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,720
totally change

595
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,480
if we change legislation

596
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,159
so we're going to dive into the

597
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,919
legislation remember this is going to be

598
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,440
u.s centric right here

599
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,960
but i want to let you know that all

600
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
around the world there is

601
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,400
anthony hacking laws anthony

602
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
circumvention laws

603
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,520
and also um acceptable use policy

604
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
laws so one thing to note about

605
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
anti-hacking laws and anti-circumvention

606
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,080
laws

607
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,679
a lot of them all around the world are

608
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,679
based on the u.s laws

609
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,000
so the u.s when they change their laws

610
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,880
around

611
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,760
then other countries tend to follow and

612
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,520
so this is one thing that we should keep

613
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,159
in mind

614
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,640
so even if this is u.s centric right now

615
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,840
at this moment

616
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,080
it also impacts you most likely in

617
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,760
whatever country that you're in

618
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,240
because it does set a motion to change

619
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,880
when legislation changes

620
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,039
so let's first go into the cfa so

621
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,200
anti-hacking laws basically

622
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
it's a law that um

623
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
prohibits accessing a computer without

624
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,039
authorization or an excess of

625
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,080
authorization

626
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,679
and this is usually used when a

627
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,440
researcher goes on a scope

628
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,240
um and is also an act used to prosecute

629
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,120
hacking

630
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
now in the u.s we have the computer

631
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
fraud abuse act

632
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
which is a really random fact we'll dive

633
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,559
into cfa in a bit but

634
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,039
um if you ever seen the movie war games

635
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,039
what happened was that ronald reagan

636
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,600
when he was president he watched it and

637
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
he freaked out about hackers and was

638
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,280
like we gotta do whatever we can

639
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,520
to stop packers from doing terrible

640
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,400
things to our country

641
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
once again he freaked out from fear and

642
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,559
whatnot and that's how cfa was created

643
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,000
because he watched this movie called war

644
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,200
games anyway

645
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,880
um let's go into the next one

646
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
anticipation laws these are also known

647
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,240
as copyright laws

648
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,320
i'm basically seeing the right to repair

649
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
or reverse engineering

650
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,440
is a bridge to property

651
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,840
now when we talk about terms and

652
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,480
conditions example use policy

653
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
i mean how many of you guys have

654
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,559
actually read your terms and conditions

655
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,799
whenever you have an update because

656
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,919
there you probably didn't

657
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,919
and that's okay because a lot of us you

658
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,440
know haven't done it i mean i tried

659
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,159
doing one

660
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,520
with apple but i got so bored

661
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,840
and not to mention it's so long so i

662
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,200
decided to watch the movie instead but

663
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
in general they could be so long too

664
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,480
much verbage and it could confuse

665
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,799
anyone especially if it's written in

666
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,600
english

667
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,840
and you're an english learner it's

668
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,200
really hard even

669
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,280
attorneys have to look at this because

670
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,880
they're written by attorneys

671
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,480
and by the way i'm not an attorney just

672
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,679
so i should let you know but the thing

673
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,600
is we have to be aware of that

674
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
um but miscommunication can seriously

675
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,960
happen

676
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,919
because of these policies how they're in

677
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,000
because they're not very straightforward

678
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,159
it's all about you know loopholes and

679
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,000
everything

680
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,320
and clearly i just want to reiterate if

681
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,360
you see the dates

682
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,600
of these laws one is 1984 the other

683
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,440
one's 1998.

684
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,919
it is so old and out of date i mean y2k

685
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,600
didn't even happen yet

686
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,640
so the thing is is that remo

687
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
remember lobby's laws are out of date

688
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,919
second thing

689
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,919
is that there were a lot of them were

690
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,159
created out of fear

691
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,640
so remember the whole thing about how

692
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,159
the amygdala works

693
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,000
so basically when ronald reagan watched

694
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,080
war games he freaked out he didn't try

695
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,559
to go

696
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,679
out into the hacker to understand

697
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,640
what is a hacker versus an attacker and

698
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,360
with those that this was going to

699
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,240
basically hurt and damage have them

700
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,960
represented

701
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,240
at the table that's what happens

702
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,440
is that if we don't have empathy then

703
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,159
and taken the time to understand all

704
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,000
perspectives all those are going to be

705
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,840
affected by a law what happens is that

706
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,880
you prosecute

707
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,520
good people at the end of the day and

708
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,159
you have

709
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,080
a law that doesn't really help the

710
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,400
communities at all so that's why it's

711
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
really important to have representation

712
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,960
at all levels

713
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,880
so the big takeaway is that there are

714
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
laws that prevent good hacking

715
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
in the same way they prevent attackers

716
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
and we need good

717
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,240
hacking more than ever especially coven

718
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,559
19.

719
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,440
so i wanted to have it to cfaa because

720
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
if you are watching this

721
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,400
you need to know about it so

722
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,559
the computer fraud abuse act once again

723
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,799
which was passed in 1984 because ronald

724
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
reagan watched four games and whatnot

725
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,279
is basically so outdated and it offers

726
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
prosecutors discretion to

727
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
threaten huge petitions and jail

728
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,440
sentences to relatively underserving

729
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,080
violations of the computer policy first

730
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,960
the cfa

731
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,039
as rin punishes exceeding authorized

732
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,120
access to a protected computer

733
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,200
a phrase vague enough to inspire some

734
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,279
really broad interpretations

735
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,279
another form of cfa is the redundant

736
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,960
provisions that enable a person to be

737
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,520
punished

738
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,799
multiple times for the same crime and

739
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,039
these charges can be stacked on top of

740
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,240
one and another

741
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
resulting a third of a higher cumulative

742
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
fines and jail time for the exact same

743
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,320
violation and we'll dive into

744
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,520
that when we talk about aaron so

745
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,760
the next thing to know is that this also

746
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
allows prosecutors to bully defendants

747
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,559
usually

748
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,799
into accepting a deal in order to avoid

749
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,720
facing a multitude of charges from

750
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,159
one single solitary act

751
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,559
which is just mind-blowing it also plays

752
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,559
a significant role in sentencing the

753
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,000
ambiguity of

754
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,679
this provision meant to toughen

755
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,520
sentencing for repeat offenders of the

756
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,240
cfa

757
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
may in fact make it possible for

758
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,320
defendants to be sentenced based on what

759
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,799
should be prior convictions too

760
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,360
but we are nothing more than multiple

761
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,720
convictions for the same

762
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,480
crime the other thing that you should

763
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,120
know

764
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,919
is that if you are in the u.s i want

765
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,080
tonight i know a lot of us are afraid of

766
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
federal prosecution and whatnot but it's

767
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,760
not too much of a fear

768
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,600
um since 2013 the doj or the

769
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,840
department of justice has done whatever

770
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,240
they can to try to prevent such cases

771
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
when ethical hackers

772
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,200
are staying within scope or they're

773
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
doing their job they're not exploiting

774
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,240
um basically to protect them the thing

775
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,880
the

776
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,360
or i guess the real sectors you need to

777
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,400
be afraid of

778
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,080
using the cfa against you is local state

779
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,279
and companies because the

780
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,360
companies have been using this the most

781
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,120
um to attack us to be honest

782
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,240
now the one thing about the cfa case

783
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,640
is that you've heard all the bad things

784
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,840
about it

785
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,559
but it has actually impacted a lot of us

786
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,440
in the community

787
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
in a way that we may never be able to

788
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,960
take back

789
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,200
and for the case of aaron swartz it's so

790
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,440
important for you guys to know about him

791
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,679
and what happened to him and to

792
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,480
understand

793
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,840
why we need rights more than ever before

794
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,480
so in 2011 carmen ort has the u.s

795
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,320
attorney's office charged with

796
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,279
hacking into mit computer network to

797
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,039
download millions of scholarly articles

798
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,320
from jstor

799
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,399
it was supposed to be an act of civil

800
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,080
disobedience meant to protest a

801
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,600
restricted access to

802
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,960
research funded by taxpayers but for

803
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,000
this the u.s attorney

804
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
brought charges that current a maximum

805
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,679
penalty of 35 years

806
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,960
in prison and 1 million dollars in fines

807
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,360
now i want to pause right there because

808
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,480
they were trying to push

809
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,320
35 years for him getting into articles

810
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,640
when in reality did you know a first

811
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,840
degree murder is 25 years in prison

812
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,120
it's it's mind-blowing but anyway he was

813
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,440
looking at a maximum penalty of 35 years

814
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,000
in person 1 million fine

815
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,559
and they were able to charge this amount

816
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
of years because the way that cfa

817
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,799
is written is written and the issues

818
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,640
that have yet to be sorted

819
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,360
since it's been made into a law now

820
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,520
overall looking at aaron's situation

821
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,159
he was dealing with a 17-month legal

822
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,679
battle which had

823
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,760
no set trial date and it didn't look

824
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,720
like it was going to end

825
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,159
anytime soon through swords perspective

826
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,640
it must have been so difficult for him

827
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,240
and overwhelming

828
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
because unfortunately the future of the

829
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,520
legal battle

830
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,240
cast into doubt was the reason why

831
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,960
sports he

832
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,440
hung himself in his own apartment on

833
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,919
january 11 2013.

834
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,000
upon his death the federal prosecutors

835
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,840
then went on to drop the charges

836
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,240
but his family does say that it was the

837
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,760
government's prosecution

838
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,919
that contributed to his decision to take

839
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,080
his own life

840
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,919
this is why it's important to talk about

841
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,279
these cases

842
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,320
because these cases show us

843
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,039
how we need to push more than ever to

844
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,880
make sure we don't have cases like this

845
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,840
ever happen again

846
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,440
and the good news here is that aaron's

847
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,600
law was something that was created

848
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
because of what he went through the

849
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,039
unfortunate of it

850
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,440
is that there was a lot of lobbyists big

851
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,240
companies

852
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
that didn't want to see this get passed

853
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,159
because they want to use it to prosecute

854
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,000
their own employees if they step out of

855
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,799
law

856
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,200
but also if any hackers get into their

857
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,240
system

858
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,919
or anything like that that they can

859
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,679
always turn around

860
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,039
and it's really scary thing because cfaa

861
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,200
is just it's so out of date it hurts

862
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,559
people

863
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,720
and it's a constant fear in the back of

864
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
our mind just being a hacker

865
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,120
the cma is that one law that just it

866
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,279
kind of lingers as a shadow

867
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,039
and it just kind of gets at you little

868
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,039
by little and aaron's law was something

869
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:53,440
that

870
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,360
was trying to push to change that so we

871
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,880
wouldn't have situations like aaron

872
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,799
schwartz went through

873
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
but aaron's law overall it removed the

874
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,320
phrase exceeds

875
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,559
authorized access and replaced it with

876
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,480
access without authorization

877
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,720
which is defined to obtain information

878
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
on a computer that the accessor

879
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
lacks authorization to obtain by not

880
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,559
only circumventing technological or

881
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,840
physical measures designed to prevent

882
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,279
unauthorized individuals from obtaining

883
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,360
that information now the dmca the one

884
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,640
thing you should note about

885
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,039
is that there hasn't been any cases of

886
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,679
how

887
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,679
to deal with being prosecuted by dmca

888
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,000
it's usually just by cfa

889
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,600
but overall um this was created as a

890
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,120
piracy in a sense so it would basically

891
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,880
make it illegal to circumvent copy

892
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,799
protections designed to prevent

893
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,840
pirates from duplicating digital copper

894
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,799
and selling or freely distributing them

895
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,799
it also makes it illegal to manufacture

896
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,360
or

897
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
distribute tools or techniques for

898
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,760
circumventing copy

899
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
but in reality controversial law itself

900
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
effects have been much

901
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,840
broader by allowing game developers

902
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,480
music

903
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
film companies and others to keep a

904
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,240
tight control on how consumers

905
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,159
use their copyrighted works preventing

906
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,000
them in some cases for making copies of

907
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,919
their purchased products

908
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,240
for their own use or from jail breaking

909
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,279
smartphones

910
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,279
even if they pay for it and it's theirs

911
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,960
and other devices to use them in ways

912
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,480
that manufacturers disliked

913
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,679
now the thing is that with improvements

914
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,960
to legislation

915
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,279
we can change where we stand today but

916
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,799
in order to do that we need to dive into

917
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,720
three categories in which we've touched

918
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,480
on already because they work together to

919
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,159
bring about public change

920
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,600
and remember when we have legislation

921
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,799
that works for us it'll be a great thing

922
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,080
for everyone else

923
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,200
because it'll keep the world a little

924
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
bit more safe

925
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,279
but we have to first influence the

926
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,880
public right that's the most important

927
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,559
thing so in order to have

928
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,480
uh rights for hackers we need to get the

929
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,679
public on board

930
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,279
and in order to do so we need to dive

931
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,200
into these three categories so

932
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,799
um we need the press to push for the

933
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,399
public to become aware

934
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,600
in other words we need to change the

935
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,679
language and imagery of a hacker and

936
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,200
start using cyber criminals for those

937
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
who commit unethical hacking

938
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
overall really separate the two groups

939
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,039
attacker from hacker

940
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,279
in order to help the press organizations

941
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,679
need to be on board with bilateral trust

942
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,120
with having vulnerability disclosure

943
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,960
programs by showing their support

944
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,200
hackers and whatnot the public does

945
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
change their perception of

946
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,360
their view in general and the thing is

947
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
when organizations and public opinion

948
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,760
are motivated and see a different light

949
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,399
of who we

950
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,360
are this does motivate legislators to

951
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,960
get on board and update our current

952
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,240
legislation

953
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
so it will protect us overall we need

954
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,720
organizations media and legislation

955
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,519
to have supporting hacker rights for it

956
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,559
to become a reality

957
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,679
now how do we get there well overall we

958
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,440
need to push for awareness of ethical

959
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,159
hackers

960
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,760
and these are the five ways to get there

961
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,919
now how we get there i

962
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,279
need you so first things first

963
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,600
this is a petition so this petition is

964
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,559
for anyone out there

965
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,440
who wants to support us you don't have

966
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,720
to be a hacker to sign this

967
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,600
if you are someone who is a relative one

968
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,360
and you are just tired of what you're

969
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,840
seeing and hearing from your loved ones

970
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,080
they can sign it too but the thing is

971
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
pushing this petition out is the first

972
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,559
step it's bringing attention to the

973
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,120
matter

974
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,919
and a mission for us to work towards and

975
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,960
everything i talked about

976
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
is in that itself but it's broken down

977
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,360
by organizations

978
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,919
legislation media and the hacker

979
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,200
community

980
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
so yes please sign and share this the

981
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,159
more sanctuaries the better

982
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,600
um and my next step from this is

983
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,080
actually

984
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,760
i've taken that petition and i've

985
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,519
partnered up with brian and hacking is

986
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,880
not a crime

987
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,120
and hacking is not a crime is in the

988
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,399
works of being developed

989
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,720
but it's communicating you guys and what

990
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,080
it is is basically

991
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,640
us pushing out a new narrative of

992
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,519
hackers

993
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,840
so then we work with the press to change

994
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,279
the way that they showcase

995
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,679
us but also work with organizations that

996
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,119
are already

997
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,399
helping the hacking community

998
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,639
so it'll be a one like your one place

999
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,639
shop for everyone who's a hacker to go

1000
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,440
to if you need

1001
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
help or assistance or if you want to

1002
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,879
help the cause

1003
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,918
um you'll have that for you

1004
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,480
now the second step is to fact check the

1005
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,960
press

1006
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
so anytime the press puts an image of us

1007
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,599
in a dark hoodie or uses the term

1008
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,199
hacker instead of attacker when they

1009
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,119
should um

1010
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,159
let them know call them out be very nice

1011
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,960
to them too

1012
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,599
because they don't know better so it's

1013
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,599
it's best for us to let them know

1014
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,639
in the kindest way possible but

1015
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,040
um if you're ever struggling to try to

1016
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
explain to someone what's the difference

1017
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
between a hacker and attacker

1018
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,160
give this example instead uh think of a

1019
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,680
hacker as a locksmith

1020
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,560
and an attacker as a burglar this is a

1021
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,160
way that a lot of people also actually

1022
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,359
understand

1023
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,560
when you compare the two

1024
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,520
the third step is that working with

1025
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,599
organizations to partner and campaign

1026
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,800
with us so if there's

1027
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,480
if you work at a company or you know of

1028
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,040
a company or an organization that is

1029
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,400
interested in pushing

1030
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,440
the rights for hackers contact me

1031
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,200
let's work together here because it's

1032
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,119
going to take a bunch of organizations

1033
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,680
to come on board to push for rights

1034
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,800
and more people the merrier to get this

1035
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,680
out in the public also to push for your

1036
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,320
organization to have disclosure programs

1037
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,599
we need some sort of coordinated

1038
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,920
disclosure it's so important

1039
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,079
for us to be able to communicate with an

1040
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,960
organization when we find something

1041
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
because we want to protect everyone

1042
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,960
right now

1043
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
the fourth step is to contact your local

1044
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,640
representatives to update the current

1045
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
legislation have to sit down talk with

1046
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,480
them but don't go at alone

1047
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
always go with another person and it's

1048
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,520
really important for you to also get

1049
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,640
some training

1050
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,560
before you do go to talk to your

1051
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,680
legislators

1052
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,920
or when you go talk to the press so

1053
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,359
there's one way how to do that there are

1054
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,960
some organizations that have some

1055
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,440
training with that that's free for you

1056
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
um we are going to put some videos

1057
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,720
together to teach you

1058
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,599
how to contact your legislator how to

1059
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,400
work with your life

1060
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,800
i talk to the press so those are coming

1061
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,920
soon

1062
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,280
if you are in the us it's really

1063
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,880
important for you to also follow the van

1064
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,119
buren versus us case because it's going

1065
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:29,760
to be

1066
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,160
the first time the cfa is visited in the

1067
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,680
supreme court and it's going to happen

1068
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,160
this fall

1069
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,800
and last piece if you don't know who the

1070
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
van buren and us case

1071
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
is um let me know and dm me i just want

1072
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,960
to make sure i have some time for q

1073
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,680
a at the end but basically it's a former

1074
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,720
georgia

1075
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,560
police officer who was wrongly convicted

1076
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,800
under the cfa

1077
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,160
basically the supreme court is right now

1078
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,920
looking at the interpretation

1079
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,440
because what happened was that van buren

1080
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,119
was accused of taking money in exchange

1081
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,960
for looking up license plate in the law

1082
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,480
enforcement database

1083
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,960
he was convicted of violating the cfa

1084
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,800
because he allegedly used that database

1085
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,839
for improper

1086
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,680
purpose even though it was a dabbies

1087
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,839
that he was allowed to access

1088
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,040
for work purposes under this expansive

1089
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,680
interpretation cfa it would be a federal

1090
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,160
crime

1091
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,880
anytime a person violates a website's

1092
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,240
term of

1093
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,320
terms of service that's really important

1094
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,359
to know

1095
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,839
that's kind of scary so if finally in

1096
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,680
terms of service is a crime

1097
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,000
private companies then get to decide who

1098
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,359
goes to prison

1099
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,839
and for what putting us all at risk for

1100
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,480
everyday online behavior

1101
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,640
um this was submitted to the supreme

1102
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,839
court so it's going to be visited this

1103
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,280
fall but it's so important for you to

1104
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,320
pay attention and

1105
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,839
hope that this doesn't get through

1106
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,760
because we don't want to keep getting

1107
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,599
worried about companies prosecuting us

1108
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,400
and the last step i have to say is um

1109
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,240
support these following organizations

1110
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,839
i am the calvary they've been working

1111
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,560
since 2013 with the department of

1112
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,320
justice talking to politicians

1113
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,079
just trying to change the mainframe of

1114
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,359
how people think

1115
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,480
of hackers also disclose that io if you

1116
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,079
want to have a good idea what companies

1117
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,079
are practicing

1118
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,560
bilateral trusts amongst a hacker and

1119
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,640
the organization what not disclosure i o

1120
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,800
is a great place to get started

1121
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,880
to see what companies are have a

1122
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,960
disclosure program in the first place

1123
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,520
um sir coordination center so start cc

1124
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,000
is also

1125
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
a great place to know of an eff and the

1126
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,599
cti

1127
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,800
league spec so reach out to them if you

1128
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,240
want to support them

1129
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,760
volunteer for them if they need

1130
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,839
volunteering or if they need

1131
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,720
funds help fundraise or donate the thing

1132
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
is just reach out to these ones and find

1133
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
out how you can get involved because

1134
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,359
they can always use more hands

1135
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,440
so the main takeaways from all this is

1136
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,200
that overall we need to push for ethical

1137
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,480
hacker rights

1138
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,560
and we have to do that by gaining better

1139
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,160
perception of who we really

1140
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,520
are which is really important and so

1141
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
the five years how to get there you have

1142
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,680
gone through it and you know it now

1143
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,359
um but i do need your advice and

1144
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,960
assistance of course so if you want to

1145
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,000
get involved at all

1146
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
just dm me it's really important that we

1147
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
start this

1148
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,760
but most importantly i just want to

1149
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,560
remind every single person

1150
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,839
that the change starts with you and me

1151
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,520
and we must not give up which is the

1152
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,200
most important thing we must continue to

1153
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,280
fight for rights because

1154
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,160
aaron swartz life matters also the other

1155
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,040
thing is that

1156
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
other people have been in situations

1157
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,880
similar to aaron

1158
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,240
and it's so important that we do

1159
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,480
whatever i can to prevent such cases

1160
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,599
from occurring

1161
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,760
so we have to have their backs and by

1162
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,800
doing that is

1163
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
pushing the public to understand that

1164
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,240
we're not an enemy here

1165
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,560
we're here to help them and we do that

1166
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,680
every day behind

1167
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,160
scenes so it's important to understand

1168
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,680
that the change really starts with you

1169
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,000
and me

1170
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,599

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,640
global thing because we're all over the

1188

1217
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,280
important work to release

1218
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,400
information to the public right um

1219
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,440

phenomenal job to help with kirby 19.

1221
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,520
i don't know if you guys know but

1222
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,920
there's been a lot of attacks on

1223
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,200
hospitals

1224
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,160
and also for medical devices and also

1225
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,000
companies that are connected to

1226
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,119
vaccine creation and so cti lee is

1227
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,000
really being there

1228
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,560
to try to prevent these breaches from

1229
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,680
occurring

1230
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,200
um there are also some other

1231
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,800
organizations that are doing that as

1232
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,200
well

1233
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,319
um in the uk and in australia

1234
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,839
all you have to do is just reach out to

1235
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,760
me and if you want to get involved or

1236
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,280
anything like that do let me know but

1237
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,839
there's

1238
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,680
there are a good number of organizations

1239
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,960
that behind these have been doing

1240
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,400
whatever they can to

1241
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,839
help um basically help us disclose

1242
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,359
things

1243
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,720
okay see another question many of the

1244
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,319
people making these laws

1245
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,760
are not touch saving are there projects

1246
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,720
that work

1247
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,760
on education these law makers so they

1248
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,560
don't get

1249
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,000
information from movies yeah

1250
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
um i would love that um so what happens

1251
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,319
is that uh people will read fictional

1252
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,119
books or

1253
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,160
they'll watch tv or whatnot and the

1254
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,960
reality is that

1255
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,079
she's gonna speak out on politicians

1256
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,599
there are some politicians out there

1257
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,839
that don't meet with people that are

1258
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,760
represented

1259
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,240
and that's a huge problem because you

1260
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,079
need representation

1261
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,240
so any party that's going to be impacted

1262
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,000
by some sort of law or creation

1263
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,720
of the law you need to meet with them

1264
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,599
and there are

1265
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,680
politicians out there that don't do that

1266
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,520
and because of that we have these

1267
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,640
ongoing problems

1268
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,280
those are created that really do impact

1269
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,560
those that are

1270
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,200
underrepresented in the community and so

1271
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,560
it's really important is to

1272
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,720
try to get at least the media and big

1273
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,880
companies to get on board with it

1274
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,280
um because this changes the mindset of a

1275
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,160
politician

1276
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,720
on how they view us and that's what we

1277
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,560
need to do is like

1278
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,760
don't don't push out of fear push out of

1279
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,160
having empathy if you want to work with

1280
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,760
a politician know what

1281
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,440
their what the things that they're

1282
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
passionate about they're trying to fix

1283
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,560
and let them know how protecting hackers

1284
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,520
is somehow part of that conversation so

1285
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,800
you want to make sure that everyone

1286
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,280
walks away from a win-win situation

1287
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,680
but that's the best way is to to really

1288
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,560
showcase

1289
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,359
how we are different from others and why

1290
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,079
it's important

1291
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,079
to utilize the hacker community to help

1292
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,680
protect

1293
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,079
our country and also to help protect

1294
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,520
