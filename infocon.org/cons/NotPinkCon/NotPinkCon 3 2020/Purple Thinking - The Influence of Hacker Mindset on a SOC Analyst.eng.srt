how my uh teammates who come from a red

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
teeming background has influenced me

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
become a better song analyst so first of

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,360
all like

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,320

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
where my where i am where i live so

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
there's a joke here among the local

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
security conferences

23
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,520
besides groupie last year i went to the

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,680
different side so there was besides

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,439
melbourne besides sydney

26
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,040
uh besides brisbane uh besides pert so i

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,920
went there

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,200
and i used to work um so

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
basically my journey through uh cyber

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
security was through

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,720
uh tech meaning i first started out

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,439
doing

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,280
network operations stuff and then i got

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
into security

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
i sorry i got into um technical training

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
and consulting and then

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,119
focused on security so um

38
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
last year i was part of the project

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
treatment that initiated by the

40
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
australian women in security network

41
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
to help more women speak out in

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,560
conferences or do public speaking and

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,520
i'm a firm

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
believer in the idick principle so if

45
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,959
there's like any star tech fan there yes

46
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,879
yeah so you can see like my rainbow

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,720
beanies like this is also my trademark

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,920
hat so if you're ever

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,319
in australia for a security conference i

50
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
mean like once things open up

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,480
yeah look for the rainbow hat i'll be

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,840
there okay

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,160
so so for this short presentation i'm

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
going to be covering what i saw

55
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,519
in the evolution of the song and then

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,760
the blue team skill set and then the

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
blue and the red white becomes

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
purple and then i'm going to talk about

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,920
the hacker ethos so this is the aim for

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,879
people who may be new in the industry or

61
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,239
who are considering

62
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,160
uh which specialization or what

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
particular niche or area in cyber

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,080
security that they want to focus

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
okay so first of all pop quiz

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,959
okay so uh there are two photos that you

67
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,840
see there

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
uh one is on the left and on the right

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,959
uh

70
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
scanda and the uh

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
direction so you i'm gonna ask you uh

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
for these two photos which one

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
represents a soft pillow

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,080
it's the other one on the left scared

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,800
that or

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,440
oh direction all right am i saying it

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,000
correctly so

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,720
left or right okay so of course i

79
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,239
wouldn't be able to see you because i'm

80
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
in tweets

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,159
so okay yeah

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,280
let's see yeah you hopefully some people

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,040
are giving like feedback

84
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,400
so sit on the one on the left or on the

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
right

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,239
so if you actually

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,560
uh chose this the one we were in there's

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
more people

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,799
yes that is a representation of a song

90
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,680
okay

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
so it's actually taken from a school uh

92
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
website in singapore

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
i used to live in singapore before i

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
went uh before i migrated to australia

95
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
and this is from a school wherein they

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,400
have their own

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
software to train uh people who are

98
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,080
interested in uh

99
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,480
focusing on blue theme or uh sock you

100
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
know kind of activities okay

101
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,238
so first of all why did i uh

102
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,519
why did i give this

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639
uh this pop quiz so my background was

104
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,040
that

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,960
so i used to work for cisco sort like

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
think of it it's like a noc it's a

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
network operation center and we

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
predominantly focus on making sure

109
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,479
that the network is out so of course we

110
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,080
cannot aim for 100

111
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,919
uptime it's like 99 or 99.99

112
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
so that's a network you know kind of

113
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,479
setup and then there were also some uh

114
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
clients or customers who are concerned

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,720
about their perimeter security so it was

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,160
more of like you know making sure that

117
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,360
the firewall

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
is working and then you have like

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
unfortunate routers your switches and

120
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,160
all those things

121
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
okay so uh what's the difference now so

122
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,199
when we talk about not

123
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,160
so on the left on your on the left side

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,800
of this

125
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,120
um presentation the slide you can see

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,520
that uh on the left these are the type

127
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,919
of

128
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,720
you know equipment appliances that are

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,039
uh

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,440
under the purview or the one that is

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
being taken care of by the knock

132
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,520
and then eventually there was a

133
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
requirement to

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
uh you know make sure that firewalls you

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
know vpn gateways are okay

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
and then later on there was a

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,080
requirement to

138
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,880
focus on more like security aspects so

139
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,479
certain organizations

140
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,639
have made i used to only have like a

141
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,479
knock wherein when you say enough

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,199
all the routers switches and our

143
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,240
infrastructure stuff

144
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
even service applications it's there i

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,520
mean like people

146
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
who are taking care of those things are

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
in there and they have like you know

148
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,880
taking care of the security devices

149
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,960
but as security requirements grew

150
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,759
and there's more you know e-commerce

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,960
more of like those

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
uh internet you know related businesses

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
uh that's happening there was a greater

154
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,280
need to

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
have a more specialized group and that's

156
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
why suddenly you have like some

157
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,199
organizations where instead of just

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,800
having not they have a knock

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
then they have a song so it could be

160
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,639
that they started doing vulnerability

161
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,600
management

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
so wherein they will do like asset

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
discovery you know do all those

164
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
scanning of the different assets to

165
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
figure out what's their vulnerability

166
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
and then you also have like security

167
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,960
event monitoring so that's basically

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
like think of it like the

169
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
evolution from like like just a knock to

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,039
having another separate song

171
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,240
okay uh now it's also quite interesting

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
because there are some organizations

173
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,000
when you talk about stock

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,919
so it's not just cyber security they

175
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,680
also do like what

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
physical security so sometimes you have

177
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,720
also cct

178
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
monitoring all those things there are

179
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
also certain organizations

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,319
wherein they don't call it stock they

181
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,280
call it c

182
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
soft meaning cyber security operation

183
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,880
center so you have

184
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
those terminologies those acronyms that

185
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,000
you could

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
you know find in you know like different

187
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
organizations or even like you know

188
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,639
different

189
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,280
literature now when we talk about sock

190
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
uh what is basically the essence of the

191
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,080
song it is more of like making sure that

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,240
there's a collection of data and

193
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
analysis so it's important to

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,479
not just collect but also analyze the

195
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,280
data

196
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
and the goal is to detect any suspicious

197
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
activities so that the

198
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,800
soft team can be uh can can act on it

199
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
okay so the idea is there has to be a

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
response to malicious activities

201
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
with the end goal of making sure that

202
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,360
the organization's infrastructure

203
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
or all their you know their environment

204
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
are well protected

205
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
and when we talk about salt um

206
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,280
there are you know in terms of the

207
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,599
activities that is being done there

208
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,319
it's mostly classified as rotating type

209
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
of activity now i need to clarify the

210
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,240
terms do team writing especially for

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,199
those people

212
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,599
who are quite new to the industry so

213
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,360
traditionally when we talk about blue

214
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,520
team activities these are activities

215
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
that are designed to

216
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,720
you know defend the organization it's

217
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,639
more defending protecting

218
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
now when you talk about threat theming

219
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
it's more on like

220
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,000
trying to have an adversarial type of

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,720
activity

222
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
on the red teaming you also have you

223
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
know penetration test

224
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,879
uh testing and a lot of people who are

225
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,800
you or sometimes people who are not in

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
the industry

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,759
will have this mindset that when we talk

228
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,280
about cyber security

229
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
it's just you know hacking or ethical

230
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,879
hacking and this is like

231
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,360
penetration testing so i go around

232
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
talking about blue team stuff so that

233
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
other people will know

234
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,360
that there are different you know facts

235
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,320
are like you know

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,958
areas in cyber security so it's not just

237
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,560
you know the ethical hackers

238
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,640
you also have people who are doing the

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,399
uh defensive sides on the

240
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,279
side so with that so i came from like

241
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,040
you know the not background

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
then went into security as i specialize

243
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,560
uh

244
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,000
in um the fear so how did i get

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
there so i did a lot of self studying

246
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
and then eventually i

247
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
um got sponsored for one sense training

248
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,519
so that wasn't foreign 6408 and after

249
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,480
that i just like

250
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,959
wow there's like so much you know that i

251
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,920
don't know

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
and i started you know uh studying some

253
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,519
more and then

254
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,360
i went for a graduate certificate

255
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
incident response from science institute

256
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
and then eventually

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,040
i when i moved to uh australia i applied

258
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,680
to the

259
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,720
unsw in canberra so i went for my

260
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
master's in cyber security with the

261
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,000
focus on digital forensics

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,560
okay so it's really like uh before i

263
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,440
joined this

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,320
uh um company i work for cyber research

265
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,440
in new zealand

266
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,279
uh they're in new zealand but i'm based

267
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,800
here in melbourne i work

268
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,680
uh remotely so i'm um you know 100 you

269
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
know work from home

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
so um i come from like a blue team site

271
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
and then so in in when we talk about

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
like doing blue team

273
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,760
stuff it's more like um the mindset is

274
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
that i have to do that

275
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
and then i have to analyze and then i

276
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
have to respond and then of course

277
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
there's going to be that report so when

278
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
i write my reports i always base it on

279
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,120
the evidence

280
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,839
what did i see and then based on what i

281
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,480
saw

282
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
i tried to put together like those

283
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
different events to provide

284
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,279
context about what happened okay now the

285
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,800
company that i work for

286
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
is an mssp so what is an mssp it's a

287
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
managed security services provider

288
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,120
so the model here is that the mssp

289
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,160
provides

290
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,760
uh you know security services okay

291
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,399
and there are different clients coming

292
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
from like different industries

293
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,279
so going back to my example previously

294
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,240
where that you have

295
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
the knock and then after afterwards

296
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
there was a specialization required and

297
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,360
then

298
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,920
the security aspect was then move out

299
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,959
then you have a song

300
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
so that kind of example is based on what

301
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,720
is called an

302
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
in-house software in the organization

303
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,839
have their

304
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,320
own security operations team

305
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,079
unfortunately um not a lot of

306
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,120
organizations

307
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
uh have the uh you know the

308
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
right amount of people or people with

309
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,160
the

310
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,800
skills that can do this very specialized

311
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
function so there are some organizations

312
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,200
where

313
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,079
in they realize that we don't have

314
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,720
enough

315
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,200
number of people or it may be that we

316
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,959
they are in a location wherein

317
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,760
it's difficult to attract people to work

318
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
in that particular

319
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,040
area or maybe there's not like you know

320
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,480
enough you know people

321
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,959
specializing in that area and that's why

322
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,839
they will engage

323
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,560
another company that provides this uh

324
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
kind of services like an

325
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,839
mssp sometimes some organizations have

326
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,000
in terms of their security maturity

327
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
they don't have uh you know like any

328
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,440
idea

329
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
what is all about so what they do is

330
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,880
that

331
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,160
they get an mssp and this mssp

332
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,800
sort of like acts as the outsource

333
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,440
thought

334
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,480
and then eventually as the organization

335
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,880
uh becomes more mature they realize that

336
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,320
hey we can do this

337
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
by ourselves and then we're going to you

338
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,160
know set up our own song

339
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,240
so there's like different organizations

340
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,839
they have like different

341
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
facts on how they you know set up their

342
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,440
song okay

343
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
now if you're a fresh graduate or you're

344
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,120
still

345
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
in the university and you're considering

346
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
you know hey i want to work in a sock so

347
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,079
which one should i choose is it a sock

348
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:28,800
in a

349
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
you know in an in-house kind of setup or

350
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,240
should i go for

351
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,279
the mssp so it really depends on

352
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,360
what you want to do so it could be that

353
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,399
you want to gain

354
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,200
more um experience like with different

355
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,000
industries

356
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,959
so in that case go for an mssp and

357
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
that's what i wanted to do i wanted to

358
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,519
like really

359
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,200
get to know like different industries

360
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
because each industry or

361
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
each client coming from uh you know

362
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,120
certain industry

363
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,519
will have their own challenges so each

364
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,360
client has a very unique

365
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,839
uh environment and there's a lot of

366
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,600
learning that has

367
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,320
and that i you know i've gained because

368
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,880
of work

369
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
because of working for uh and for an

370
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
mssp

371
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,320
now if you just um if you're thinking of

372
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
going for an in-house sock

373
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,279
a job role that's also fine because

374
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,519
i uh when you're in an in-house stock

375
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,959
you know set up

376
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,959
it's easier for you to communicate with

377
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,040
your end users with the stakeholders

378
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,560
because you all belong

379
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,040
in a certain in one organization you've

380
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
all worked for a company

381
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,399
like for example if you find something

382
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,240
suspicious there was this

383
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,519
traffic from one end point or a host

384
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,480
computer

385
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,600
going connecting to you know a computer

386
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,399
and then you

387
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,639
you saw an alarm if you belong to an

388
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,680
in-house off

389
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,000
so it's just so easy to either you know

390
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
send a message using your

391
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,480
uh company collaboration tools to that

392
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
end user and ask them hey

393
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,040
did you try to attempt to connect to

394
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,440
this

395
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,000
you know to this resource but you were

396
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,920
denied and then you could ask those

397
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
things it's so easy to

398
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,519
belong to the same organization but if

399
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,639
you work for like

400
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,760
an outsourced stock an mssp but

401
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
depending on the communication

402
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,440
um pathways or you know what was

403
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
the agreement with between the mssp and

404
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,120
their

405
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,480
um and their client it could be that you

406
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,920
send them a ticket

407
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,760
or sometimes it could be that you have

408
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
those you know you've been use like a

409
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
slap or something so it depends

410
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,839
okay so each one has its own pros and

411
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,800
cons but

412
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,279
i guarantee you when you if you're new

413
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,880
and you decide to work for a song

414
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
there's a lot of things that you're

415
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
gonna be you know doing and it's

416
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
very interesting one the each day is

417
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,360
like different from

418
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,279
you know the other days there's always

419
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,760
variety okay

420
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
now for those who are wondering what are

421
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
the skill sets blue team skill sets that

422
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,600
you need in order

423
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
to you know uh function well in in a

424
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,959
soft

425
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,120
so first of all there is a requirement

426
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,839
to have at least you know the very basic

427
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
pose server and network knowledge you

428
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,160
have to be familiar with

429
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,399
you know the operating system server

430
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,279
like for example

431
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,920
active directory and you know networking

432
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
knowledge because

433
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,399
most of the stock um soft or

434
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,839
mssps okay will rely on looking at

435
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,639
network

436
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,639
you know uh the network traffic so

437
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,920
familiarity with

438
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,399
packet capture that's like uh and then

439
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,160
packet capture analysis that's really

440
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,040
important

441
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
and then of course log and data analysis

442
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
so you will be looking at logs

443
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
and you will have to analyze that you

444
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
depending on the soft that you work for

445
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,839
there will be

446
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,079
different tools that you know the stock

447
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,600
will be using to do this

448
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,120
you know analysis and then now

449
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,160
the third fourth and fifth part

450
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,279
now this may be like for someone who is

451
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,360
a little bit more like level two level

452
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,839
three

453
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,399
okay so digital forensics and then

454
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,240
incident response and malware vs

455
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,120
engineering

456
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
by the way if you listen to the keynote

457
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
speaker it was a very fantastic talk

458
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,440
about you know

459
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,519
malware versus there's like really no

460
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,360
short target you you have to keep on

461
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,160
practicing

462
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,079
now so um in our company because we

463
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,639
have a you know a small team we are like

464
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,040
basically gap of all three so we do all

465
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,920
these things

466
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,560
yeah uh but the more reverse engineering

467
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,079
it like really depends on what is the

468
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
requirement of the customer because

469
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,000
most of the time it maybe gets you know

470
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
like a commodity malware so

471
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
when we talk about commodity malware

472
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,079
there is detection with a different tool

473
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,480
so

474
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
when you need to do like more like

475
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,320
reverse engineering if it's like

476
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
something suspicious there's like a file

477
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,800
that is suspicious then you have to

478
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,360
dig deeper and you know analyze that so

479
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
these are the blue team skill set in

480
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,600
order

481
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,639
for you uh that you need in order to uh

482
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,360
you know succeed in a soft environment

483
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
don't worry about the

484
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,880
uh point one the first point and the

485
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
second point because all those things

486
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,520
okay you can learn them you know you you

487
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
set up your own

488
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
home lab and you know uh do some

489
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,359
practice okay and even digital friends

490
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:11,839
section

491
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,599
you can like there are like different

492
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
tools and i'm sorry not tools

493
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,240
like free you know lab environment or

494
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
like you know like a vm that you could

495
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,119
uh work um work with so there's like

496
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,720
safe workstation from

497
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,039
sans now okay

498
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,280
now so talk about the difference earlier

499
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,320
regarding

500
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,039
you know blue themes and red things now

501
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,559
so i come from a very

502
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,160
blue team type of background and when i

503
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,280
joined i was their first hire which is

504
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,480
like really predominantly blue

505
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
other colleagues who were hired before

506
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
me their background was more on them

507
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
you know red teaming more on fantastic

508
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,720
so i was the first blue team you know

509
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,360
like

510
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
uh higher blue team you know or someone

511
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,720
with a bluetooth mindset

512
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,480
so i'm really grateful for my teammate

513
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
because they're very helpful and they're

514
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,559
very patient okay they were the one who

515
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,160
taught me about like the different tools

516
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,799
because

517
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,360
i'm used to using like different you

518
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
know malware-based kind of

519
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,080
uh detection tools and then uh when i

520
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
joined the organization it's more about

521
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,360
like

522
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
using a lot of like blogs looking at

523
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
like you know [ __ ] captures and then

524
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,360
at the same time the interesting thing

525
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,640
was that

526
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,039
they basically repurposed certain

527
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,080
hacker tools for you know blue team kind

528
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,160
of activity so i'm not sure if you've

529
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,960
heard about

530
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,600
bloodhound but do check it out because

531
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
it's a tool that was

532
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,799
first uh created in order to determine

533
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,360
you know

534
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,720
uh active directory you know um

535
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,200
relationships so if you're gonna be you

536
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,280
know uh attacking an organization you

537
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160
want to like

538
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
go for the you know crown jewels the

539
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,240
active directory and then you need to

540
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,360
figure out like

541
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,160
uh who are the users or like domain you

542
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,720
know

543
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,799
administrators and then you can use like

544
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,160
blackhouse so

545
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,120
uh in our team i basically use

546
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,240
bloodhound to collect

547
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,120
you know active directory architects and

548
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,880
then when i need to look up like you

549
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,360
know

550
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,120
users and then you know like

551
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
relationships and all those things i

552
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,400
basically just query

553
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
uh the bloodhound collected artifacts so

554
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,919
that's one

555
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,039
um main thing that i learned from my

556
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
teammates like you can report for

557
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,760
certain tools

558
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,160
and then second is like thinking like an

559
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,039
attacker

560
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,000
so as i said before when you know i

561
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
would write you know some

562
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,520
reports like you know incident response

563
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,960
reports it would be like

564
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,520
this was detected i saw this and i built

565
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,720
up the timeline

566
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
of events like what happened so it's

567
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,960
more of like you know observing and then

568
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,720
making a conclusion based on my

569
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
observations but

570
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
now with my teammates they always like

571
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,280
say like

572
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,320
when you look at logs think of you know

573
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,080
if you're an attacker

574
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,559
how will you go about you know attacking

575
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,559
this organization which one

576
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,440
which one would you target first or what

577
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,799
is going to be your

578
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,960
uh behavior if you're gonna you know

579
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,039
move laterally so it's always like

580
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,799
you know think like an attacker when

581
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,159
analyzing dogs

582
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,640
now there is an interesting uh tool

583
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,039
analysis worksheet that the

584
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,840
japan cert has came up this particular

585
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,760
tool analysis worksheet i have the links

586
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,720
later on

587
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
in my uh in the last slide here so that

588
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,400
you can you know

589
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,960
go look for those things so the uh this

590
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
japan cert

591
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,080
uh tool analysis worksheet has

592
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,880
those different tools that are used by

593
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,960
attackers and what are the

594
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,600
forensic artifacts that they that they

595
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,880
leave behind meaning

596
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,960
if the attacker used this particular

597
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,919
tool

598
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,039
what are the logs or the source of

599
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,320
evidence that you can

600
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,720
check in your organization to find out

601
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,000
if this tool was

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,760
run in your organization so that's a

603
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
good tool analysis worksheet

604
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,559
now the third thing that my teammates

605
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,240
has influenced me is to

606
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,640
make full use of the vulnerability

607
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,919
management tools

608
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
so we use i'm not gonna name vendors but

609
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
there's like different vendors out there

610
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,159
so for vulnerability management okay i

611
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,039
look at the report so i know which

612
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,919
particular

613
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,320
servers in my client environment is

614
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,200
susceptible

615
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
to certain you know vulnerabilities of

616
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
course we always have advisory and tell

617
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,400
them that

618
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,280
hey when we run this vulnerability scan

619
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,400
we found this

620
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,240
you know issues issues and uh we need to

621
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,159
make sure that you do your patching but

622
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,840
at the same time at the back of my mind

623
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,640
at least

624
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,760
i know that this um

625
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,720
particular server is you know kind of

626
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,320
vulnerable so i have to make sure that

627
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,960
when i'm

628
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,080
doing my you know my searching you know

629
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,520
during the day for that particular

630
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,840
client and pay attention to this you

631
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,679
know server or this group of servers

632
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,640
okay

633
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,440
and then the fourth uh influence and my

634
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,120
teammates on you is that

635
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,400
um they always say demonstrate impact so

636
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,240
it used to be when i like make reports

637
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
are just like you know right there that

638
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,559
oh there was an alert and then we you

639
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,840
know i checked this

640
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,799
found this you know and uh it's using

641
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,919
let's just say

642
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,799
uh still using smb version one and this

643
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,679
is not a

644
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,919
you know a secure version so you have to

645
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,720
you know

646
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
turn that off and use a more secure

647
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,760
version so

648
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,480
but for my teammates when they make a

649
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,559
report they have to be demonstrated back

650
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,320
like for example if they found

651
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,240
a particular uh you know a

652
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,840
server they will try to uh

653
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,039
not hack but rather try to log in using

654
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,960
certain default credentials

655
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,480
so they that's to demonstrate impact but

656
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,200
before you go doing those things okay

657
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,039
caution and there's a thing you have to

658
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,840
remember

659
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,679
you have to make sure that if you work

660
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,120
on an mssp

661
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,400
or even for an in-house sock that you

662
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,600
have permission to do

663
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,720
simulated adversarial activities don't

664
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
go you know looking for like oh there's

665
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,000
like this you know

666
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,320
uh server out there that's like exposed

667
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,919
out in the internet and then i'm just

668
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,039
gonna try to

669
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,200
rdp to it even though it's like it

670
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,039
belongs to your client you have to have

671
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,320
it in the contract

672
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
and then last there um they always have

673
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,760
this mindset of be playful like how can

674
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,799
i get in

675
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,640
so we always like brainstorm about

676
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,720
things and how how can we get in

677
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
how do we get into our clients

678
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,799
environment and based on that we provide

679
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,799
recommendations in improving their

680
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,159
security posture

681
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,000
okay now um

682
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,159
at this point there's something that i'd

683
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,080
like to share with you not everybody

684
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,039
has actually heard of the hacker ethos

685
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,480
so the if you haven't heard of the

686
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,200
hacker yet

687
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,799
the idea is that um there's no judgment

688
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,000
about your you know race sex gender

689
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
academic background or your position so

690
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,640
anybody who is interested in tech

691
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,200
and tries to understand the tech they

692
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
will be considered a hacker

693
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,840
and there is a commitment to

694
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,640
transparency in openness

695
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
especially those security researchers

696
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
who are you know

697
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,120
doing their research in terms of you

698
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,440
know

699
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,760
improving security for a particular

700
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,480
product

701
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,640
or particular software so there's not

702
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,760
commitment and

703
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,240
information is shared so that uh

704
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
everyone

705
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,880
everyone can be helped so the idea here

706
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,440
with hacker is that no matter whether

707
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
you come from like the blue team side

708
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,480
you know

709
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
red team side or you have like you know

710
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
kind of a purple team kind of

711
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,960
mentality we all uh it is

712
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,480
a great cause to you know

713
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,000
try to you know follow the hacker ethos

714
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,120
basically use our uh talents

715
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,640
and skill set to help our community okay

716
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,400
now so so

717
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
anyway so i this one i guess i talked

718
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,799
too fast

719
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,120
and i think i have like plenty of time

720
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,919
for you know

721
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,840
question so um here are the links so

722
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,760
there's the bloodhound link

723
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,919
there's the tool analysis worksheet from

724
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,360
the japan sir

725
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
okay and then you have like the links to

726
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,200
those free photos that i got

727
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,240
so do we have any questions there about

728
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,919
this

729
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,240
so my point in like giving this talk is

730
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,559
to influence you know people to consider

731
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,840
going to a stock

732
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,240
okay there are into a second to make

733
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,960
sure that

734
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
people also understand that when we talk

735
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
about cyber security

736
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,320
it's not just you know the ethical

737
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
hackers you also have the

738
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,960
defenders okay and of course for

739
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,840
everyone to start

740
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,240
embracing the hacker ethos whether

741
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,520
you're in the blue team

742
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,559
or red team or you know uh whichever

743
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,440
part of that

744
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,640
you know that you work in

745
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,159
you have any questions okay

746
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,559
well maybe you're trying or something i

747
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,600
have my

748
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,720
twitter there at guile dc so my dms are

749
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,520
open

750
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,480
uh please feel free to message me due to

751
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,520
the time difference

752
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,679
maybe i won't be able to respond quickly

753
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,120
or maybe

754
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
it could be that it's my daytime but i'm

755
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,279
busy analyzing the logs

756
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,120
so i only get to respond at night

757
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,760
hi guys excellent talk we have some

758
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,320
questions in the discord channel so i am

759
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,039
going to

760
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,840
ask the questions to you the first one

761
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
is

762
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,559
what do you recommend to study to enter

763
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,080
a sock team okay

764
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,200
that's a good question okay so

765
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,880
i'll just go back to my slides here blue

766
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,120
team skill set so the first point here

767
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,240
but it's about

768
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,279
who's server network knowledge so

769
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,320
i suggest you read up about it um think

770
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,880
of it like system administration so

771
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
uh i'll be frank majority of our clients

772
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
are on a windows environment

773
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,240
so focus on the windows operating system

774
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
you need to understand uh you know like

775
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
the different you know um

776
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,039
services the windows services so you

777
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,559
know what is normal

778
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,960
okay and then you have to understand you

779
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,320
know active directory

780
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,159
like you know like and then permissions

781
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,840
all those things and then of course

782
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,919
network knowledge networking knowledge

783
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,559
so

784
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,320
you should make sure that you also

785
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
understand the different network

786
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,440
protocols so of course

787
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,679
http you know https and do some practice

788
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,880
with pickup there are a lot of online uh

789
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,960
websites where you can download pickup

790
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,480
where you can study it

791
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,880
okay so look for there's a very good

792
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,840
book about

793
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,399
wireshark so just look for that and then

794
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,120
log in data analysis so basically this

795
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
is more on like

796
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,320
uh the different logs that you know um

797
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,559
that you can get out of let's just say

798
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,399
in a windows environment so just be

799
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,919
familiar with the different

800
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,840
you know event ids of course there's

801
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,000
thousands don't memorize them all but

802
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,559
just

803
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,520
uh understand like if something happens

804
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,000
in an

805
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,799
endpoint or a computer like what are the

806
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,120
potential you know event ids that you

807
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,520
know

808
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,799
uh will show you what happened

809
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,640
and then if you want to further uh

810
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
specialize you know like look at

811
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,039
uh digital forensics so focus on

812
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,559
endpoint or the host

813
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,279
of forensics windows forensics okay

814
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,960
perfect one question more

815
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
they ask if if you are in the blue team

816
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,360
it is possible for for a person to enter

817
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,720
the to do research and

818
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
exploit development

819
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,799
okay coming from the blue team to

820
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,919
exploit development and research okay

821
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,360
so in that case you will have to look

822
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,840
for an

823
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,880
organization wherein they will

824
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,000
have uh that kind of specialization like

825
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,120
for example

826
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,480
okay think of that song as

827
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,760
something that just

828
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,399
start uh in terms of your early in your

829
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,120
career

830
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,440
because being in a sock like for example

831
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,480
when you look at

832
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,720
you know endpoints and you further like

833
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,159
study like you know

834
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,039
uh the operating system and you get to

835
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,039
understand the operating system or the

836
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,080
applications

837
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,640
so that will give you an idea like hey i

838
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,840
think there's some you know

839
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,399
issues that i see there and then you can

840
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,320
do further research so it really depends

841
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,679
on the organization so

842
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,240
it could be that if you're new you start

843
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,159
with the socks and then get to know

844
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,120
really

845
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,320
you know um operating system and

846
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,880
application and then further specialize

847
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,840
so the the great thing about cyber

848
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,760
security especially with red team and

849
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,799
the team is that

850
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,399
there are people who come from a red

851
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,240
