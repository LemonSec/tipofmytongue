1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:07,910
morning for my side my name is bachi

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:09,830
stukowski and it's a pleasure to present

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,320
you the preliminary work that we are

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,000
working on mess with respect to

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,799
disability and user experience this is

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,900
joint work with my supervisor Gabrielle

7
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:19,939
Ellen Seanie and we are from the Center

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,150
for security reliability trust at

9
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,349
University of Luxembourg so just to give

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,359
you a brief outline I'm gonna introduce

11
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:28,310
a bit the motivation about these

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,900
projects the methodology and preliminary

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,028
results that we have and what are the

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,989
next steps that we do in this direction

15
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:38,330
so I guess I do not need to explain much

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,850
to this community how Miss works

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,560
what type of use it has or how the

18
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,260
information is shared or could be shared

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,400
among the instances and communities but

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,620
it is important to know that there are

21
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,330
different types of users that come from

22
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,860
different types of organizations and

23
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,390
they have different purposes for which

24
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,460
they use the mese platform so we're

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,040
dealing with a very technically advanced

26
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,430
information sharing platform here and as

27
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,600
I said it has a diverse set of

28
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,940
stakeholders that are involved in this

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,089
platform they all have distinctive needs

30
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,970
and objectives and probably some of you

31
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,590
have experienced but as communicated by

32
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,480
Miss often there are sharing

33
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,980
difficulties so basically that are not

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,470
so much in the technical level but on

35
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,700
the social level in terms of certain

36
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,530
restrictions why people share

37
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,510
information or do not share information

38
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,700
how do they consume the information do

39
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:33,320
they trust the information or not so

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:36,320
there are a lot of issues that hover

41
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,630
let's say the technical layers of this

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,270
platform and as research suggests as

43
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,908
well the importance of user experience

44
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,470
and usability let's say these aspects

45
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,940
are paramount for the successful

46
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,770
operation of an information sharing

47
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,729
platform and the amount of information

48
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:55,330
that is consumed and contributed towards

49
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,549
it so we set out to investigate

50
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,720
basically how do miss P users evaluate

51
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:02,690
the accessibility and user experience

52
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,250
aspects of the platform and more

53
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,350
specifically how do they perceive both

54
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,110
the pragmatic and hedonic qualities of

55
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,959
the system and I will explain a bit more

56
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,860
in detail now so we set out to

57
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,560
investigate this

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,060
as a first step via a quantitative

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,630
method called the user experience

60
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,880
questionnaire which is basically

61
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,480
combination of six scales with 26 items

62
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,880
that asks people to rate specific

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,440
aspects from to imposing views such as

64
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,299
for example do you find the system

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,820
annoying or enjoyable so they have to

66
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,130
pick a value between these two values so

67
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,750
there are 26 questions of this forum

68
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,250
that try to answer or get some

69
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,740
information about the attractiveness

70
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,680
perspicuity or basically how difficult

71
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,200
it is to learn the platform or the

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,060
system the product how it is efficient

73
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,970
what is the dependability the

74
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,000
stimulation and novelty of this platform

75
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,030
so just to give you an interdependence

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,380
of these scales basically the

77
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,470
attractiveness is a pure valence

78
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,720
dimension whereas the efficiency

79
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:14,010
dependability and price security are

80
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,959
more on the goal-directed aspects of the

81
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,239
platform or the pragmatic qualities and

82
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,610
then on the hedonic sides we have the

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,560
stimulation and novelty basically how do

84
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,350
people find these aspects as well which

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,510
usually in the past have not been

86
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:31,290
considered by usability studies so the

87
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:34,798
second part was to investigate a bit

88
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,660
more who are the users that use this

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,049
platform so basically the demographics

90
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,870
the background profile education etc and

91
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,700
some of the questions were what is the

92
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,180
company that you come from how long have

93
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,089
you been using miss etc and the last

94
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,590
part is one more quantitative scale

95
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,030
which is called the system usability

96
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,650
scale and I presume maybe some of you

97
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,959
might have come across it because it is

98
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,660
a more known or standardized scale that

99
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,799
has existed for more years than the you

100
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,730
EQ however with any like with all of the

101
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,170
other scales there are certain

102
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,670
limitations those things that we need to

103
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,890
take into account when deploying them

104
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,630
and in specifically in the s u.s. it

105
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,289
does not look into any of the user

106
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:19,079
experience for the hedonic aspects so

107
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:23,190
this is for example what it what

108
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,039
questions from the SES look like so at

109
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,260
the training session that was carried

110
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,840
out in March early this year

111
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,270
we had discussed with the team of circle

112
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,210
to try to get the preliminary feedback

113
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,270
from the participants of this training

114
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,979
session on a voluntary basis to tell us

115
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,870
how do they perceive the the MIS

116
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,770
platform etc so there were 50 people

117
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,110
that were the training session 25

118
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,400
responded 25 did not respond to the

119
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:58,980
questionnaire of those 25 24 were male 1

120
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:01,260
was a female they had 20 had a technical

121
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:06,090
or engineering background five were

122
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:08,820
non-technical in terms of education 19

123
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:13,049
were more than 75 percent anonymous

124
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:18,990
taken had the bachelor's degree or

125
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:21,030
higher when it comes to the age span we

126
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,040
can see that the largest group of people

127
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:30,780
were in the range of 26 to 235 so

128
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,640
relatively a young age group and when

129
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,179
when it comes to the prior experience

130
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,250
with Miss the majority of them had used

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,070
the system for less than six months out

132
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,360
of which from one to six months was the

133
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,990
largest group were basically eight

134
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,180
people when we asked them how often they

135
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,440
use NISP

136
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,840
the people that attended this training

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,300
session said that most of them said that

138
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,820
it is between once and three times per

139
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,270
week it's only a small number used it on

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:04,070
a daily basis and the next smaller group

141
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:07,859
seventeen was even less than one week

142
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:11,180
when it comes to the industry sector the

143
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,970
participants came from these let's say

144
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,440
industries the largest was banking I

145
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,419
don't know if it has to do the fact that

146
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,630
we did the training here in Luxembourg

147
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:25,650
but that was the case in this training

148
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,000
session and when it comes to user

149
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,799
profiles now this was interesting

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,260
because before the survey we thought

151
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,240
that people have a clear let's say role

152
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,610
but many of them actually see themselves

153
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,450
the software analysts in addition to

154
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,249
another role so this is how each of the

155
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,169
people have whisperer

156
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:45,509
basically how many have indicated it and

157
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,919
see themselves the software analyst in

158
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:50,819
addition to maybe some at some of the

159
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,619
other roles so it is interesting to see

160
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,059
that there are certain users that use

161
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:58,349
the platform for multiple purposes

162
00:06:54,059 --> 00:07:02,339
actually okay so just to summarize so

163
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:04,469
48% were in this pain from 26 to 35 the

164
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,469
majority and I'll identify themselves as

165
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:09,389
security analysts they came from banking

166
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,829
the majority of them and while it was

167
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,099
the first training session for all of

168
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:15,559
them over 50% of them had used the

169
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,938
training materials or the virtual

170
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,829
machine before coming to the training

171
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:26,459
session which is one of the let's say

172
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:28,259
materials that cert circle provides okay

173
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,209
so these are the results of the

174
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,039
questionnaires and I presume this might

175
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:35,249
not necessarily mean much so I will try

176
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,959
to explain it within a larger context so

177
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:39,569
we'll start with the user user

178
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,329
experience questionnaire and basically

179
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:46,169
if we look at if we compare those means

180
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:50,459
against benchmark values we can see that

181
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:53,159
the miss platform is positively

182
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:56,549
evaluated on all aspects except for

183
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,769
perspicuity or basically those users

184
00:07:56,549 --> 00:08:00,388
found it quite complex and difficult to

185
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:03,419
use the platform all on all the others

186
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:05,759
it is very good and especially on the

187
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,068
hedonic side which is actually excellent

188
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,759
or above-average so these benchmark

189
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:15,269
values are obtained from a data set and

190
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,299
that has been carried out or that

191
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:20,969
compromise comprises 401 studies with 18

192
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:23,399
more than 18,000 people so basically the

193
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,889
average estimate of different types of

194
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,899
platforms using this scale give us

195
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,639
certain benchmark values against which

196
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,499
we can compare other systems and of

197
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,769
course we need to take this with a bit

198
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:36,990
of a consideration but I will come to

199
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:41,669
the let's see the limitations in a

200
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:46,319
minute so when it comes to the hedonic

201
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:48,209
aspects so basically how people find the

202
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:51,269
platform in terms of novelty motivation

203
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:54,550
etc it is above average it is in the

204
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:56,230
best Henry's then present best results

205
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,660
when it comes to how easy it is to learn

206
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,530
the system that is let's say the aspect

207
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,510
that me is worst on 25% and when it

208
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,880
comes to the SU s so basically the third

209
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,600
and the second scale that I showed you

210
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,460
before

211
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,530
the average score is sixty four point

212
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,690
five again this is a benchmark value

213
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,020
that has been obtained by analyzing a

214
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,180
lot a large number of different products

215
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,920
etc where 68 is considered to be the

216
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,290
average value so basically sixty four

217
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,329
point five is considered to be below

218
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,150
average which again probably might be

219
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,450
due to the fact of the difficulty to

220
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:35,050
learn the platform etc so what we need

221
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,820
to mention here is that these findings

222
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,790
are based on a very small sample so

223
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,280
basically based on 25 responses so we

224
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,410
cannot really conclude anything strongly

225
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,600
however it can give us an early

226
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,969
indication or direction in which we can

227
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,700
try to explore further and that is

228
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,670
definitely what we would like to do so

229
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,580
using mixed methods and here I again

230
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,520
mention these quantitative surveys such

231
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,560
as the EU q but also using interviews

232
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,840
and other methods we would like to

233
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,150
understand better what are the biggest

234
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,000
usability user experience issues because

235
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,620
of course these surveys can only point

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,260
us to a direction but it does not they

237
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,820
do not really explain why people answer

238
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,340
these questions like that or why do they

239
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,310
find the platform difficult to learn etc

240
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,470
so we would like to complement within

241
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,989
the next period quantitative methods

242
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,330
using some interviews so I'll be here

243
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,070
throughout the day if any of you have

244
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,140
any feedback or comments I would be more

245
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,820
than happy to hear them but of course it

246
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,130
is on a voluntary basis so you're more

247
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,110
than welcome to also provide maybe some

248
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,980
other feedback where other ways through

249
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,410
the tip etc so just to mention as a the

250
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,480
final step I invite you all to take part

251
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,230
in the user experience survey which we

252
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,290
have ported into an online forum and

253
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,390
this will be basically provided I think

254
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,969
also with the latest training materials

255
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:01,360
and the link will be provided from from

256
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,400
the circle website but from my side that

257
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,380
is all for now and a thank you for the

258
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,390
intention if you have any questions feel

259
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,050
free to let me know either in person or

260
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:19,649
do

261
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:19,649
in this podium man thank you yes

262
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,969
so in relation to this trivia how long

263
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,829
do you plan to keep it open and then

264
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:33,010
wait until you get enough results just

265
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:35,019
to have a rough idea so I think we will

266
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,019
perform analysis on a continuous basis

267
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,810
but I would say we would have it at

268
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:41,800
least for six months but even more

269
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,750
hopefully it will be something that will

270
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,510
continue on and we will get continuous

271
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,890
feedback in terms of also to be able to

272
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,720
compare how the introduction of new

273
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:57,100
features might impact the overall

274
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:58,720
experience etc so it's not like some

275
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,860
stuff you've done here are also like

276
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,870
related to the threat Intel community so

277
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,540
maybe it'd be interesting to compare

278
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,550
with already's threat Intel wise or

279
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,810
maybe other similar software have you

280
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,189
considered doing that with similar

281
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:17,800
software that's an interesting question

282
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,899
so basically if we have more data we

283
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,760
will also be able to compare how

284
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:24,070
different people evaluate the platform

285
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,819
depending on their background depending

286
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,829
on their background their role etcetera

287
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,450
but as you say it would also be good to

288
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:34,890
compare different types of products

289
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:37,810
using these methodologies now we would

290
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,520
probably need to find a large enough

291
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,619
sample that uses both of these systems

292
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,709
so that we can compare and see how they

293
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,600
evaluate those systems or if it's if

294
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,160
it's an even bigger sample than maybe

295
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,470
not the same people need to necessarily

296
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,709
evaluate both systems but we need to

297
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,910
make sure that the sample of the users

298
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,529
that answer these questions is

299
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,510
representative so that we do not come to

300
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,890
some fall conclusions but I think that's

301
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,890
something definitely that could be done

302
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:14,110
thanks very much for this what's your

303
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:17,140
instrument clearly focused on what I

304
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,370
call the UI of the tool because it

305
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,110
occurs to me that there may be

306
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,889
particularly in some of the categories

307
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,410
of respondent

308
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:28,220
some conceptual issues like what's a

309
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:31,118
galaxy and that might be a separate set

310
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,709
of you know user experience issues then

311
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:35,179
why is this button disappearing at this

312
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:37,069
time kind of thing I just wanted to

313
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:39,199
where's this both either I what if

314
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:41,059
there's a connection between I don't

315
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,949
understand what you mean by matrix and

316
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:47,269
I'm not having a good experience with

317
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:50,089
the tool so the questions that are in

318
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,679
the scales they're independent from any

319
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,899
platform they can be applied as such

320
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,119
across different so there is no

321
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,009
ambiguity when it comes to the specifics

322
00:13:56,119 --> 00:14:00,949
of the LAT form such as as you mentioned

323
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:02,269
specific features etc those are probably

324
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:05,449
things that could be investigated

325
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:07,869
furthermore in an interview but I would

326
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:10,248
not say that any bias was introduced via

327
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:11,869
the terminology that is used in the

328
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,779
platform and what the question is asked

329
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:17,149
because these are basically yeah

330
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:20,949
applicable throughout without any

331
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,949
consideration for the specific features

332
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:30,889
okay thank you

333
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,889
[Applause]
