1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:10,239
okay good morning everybody and morocco

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:12,789
di Domenico member of L do cert where I

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,900
work as a threat intelligence analyst

4
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:22,599
and today I would like to share to you

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:25,528
my work about the IOC life cycle and I

6
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:30,369
started to study this problem basically

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:34,170
reading three documents one was about

8
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:37,899
your work about the king of indicators

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,210
the N is a taxonomy that passed

10
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,789
described an indicator of compromise and

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,399
then my idea move it from another

12
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:49,809
document propose it on the World

13
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:54,340
Congress in 2012 where they used the

14
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:56,108
recommender system for a Japanese TV so

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,149
which is the problem the problem is the

16
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:01,420
constant grow in the number of indicator

17
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:04,750
of compromise that the IT department has

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,900
to manage of course this is our point of

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,659
view this is a business point of view

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,630
but the problem is also as a member of

21
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:17,200
the intelligence team is also provide of

22
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:20,259
ways usable information for the decision

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,470
making process so the the goal was

24
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:26,890
propose a theoretical solution for the

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:30,039
aging of the indicators but also find a

26
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,409
solution to improve the output of the

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,350
threat intelligence activities and the

28
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:37,750
idea is men approach based on

29
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,729
collaborative analysis using the

30
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:45,130
taxonomy best described in detail so the

31
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:48,579
parallel between a recommender

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:53,199
recommender system and our approach is

33
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:55,240
that the recommender system as has the

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,270
goal is to generate meaningful

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,589
recommendations to or from a collection

36
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:06,130
of users or items or products so in our

37
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:09,250
case the meaningful recommendation could

38
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:13,359
be keep or discard and indicator as

39
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,040
malicious collection of users we can use

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,739
the threat intelligence feeds

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,608
as a collection of users and items of

42
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:26,290
course our our set over you see that we

43
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:29,500
can use as input from the idea this is

44
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,108
the model so we use an indicator of

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:37,420
compromise list as in good we use the

46
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:39,489
API cortex and we are going to calculate

47
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,738
the sauce rate this is the rate

48
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:46,060
calculator from each threat intelligence

49
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:50,290
feed for each indicator then we finally

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,780
calculate final rate and at that point

51
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:57,700
we can take a decision about the

52
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:00,430
indicator and in which way we use the

53
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,388
variables to set in the system in order

54
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:08,409
to calculate single rate we used the IOC

55
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:13,769
data model promoted by LD assert that

56
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:17,649
best describe and an indicator the model

57
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:21,250
consists of nine namespace and line

58
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:24,329
predicate but only six are mandatory so

59
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,819
could be good to describe and indicator

60
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,150
so from the IOC data model wishes a set

61
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:33,698
of variables to using the system and

62
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,400
wishes the TLP wishes freshness

63
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:39,430
calculated as the difference between the

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,760
current date and detection date we use

65
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:46,109
level point from each threat

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,540
intelligence feed who is DHS and the

67
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,060
Admiralty scale and the sous-vide

68
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:58,540
sous-vide is a percentage value

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:04:01,479
calculated calculated on each threat

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,048
intelligence feed that represent when

71
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:08,530
the feed seen over the time all the list

72
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:12,459
of the indicator so the idea is

73
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,699
calculate build the rates rates vector

74
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:18,099
where we put all the variables user from

75
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:22,300
the IOC data model then we calculate

76
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:25,570
associate and associate is just a

77
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,540
product between sous-vide point and the

78
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:32,290
summation of the value of their in the

79
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:35,590
rates vector and at the second stage we

80
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:38,440
obtain a matrix and in every row we have

81
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,500
the IOC and the single rate is

82
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,960
calculated by each field at the end we

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,970
can calculate the final rate for each

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:52,810
indicator and then we can we can we are

85
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:55,810
at point to take a decision so in which

86
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,490
way we have to decide if we have to keep

87
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:03,090
or discard indicator one idea is

88
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:06,730
calculate the average rate between all

89
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,280
IOC final rates then we put in the

90
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:13,960
system at theta value a threshold value

91
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,780
expressed as a percentage and consider a

92
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:20,620
deviation from this value the deviation

93
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,409
is calculated as the deviation in in

94
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:28,780
that formula so in this way we have to

95
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:31,540
say we use a theta value so I'm saying I

96
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,539
want to discard all the indicators that

97
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,840
are rather than theta value from the

98
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:43,480
average rate so this is the algorithm

99
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:46,570
very really easy so if the deviation

100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,450
from the average rate is greater than

101
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:52,330
theta we are going to keep the indicator

102
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:57,159
as malicious otherwise we can discard

103
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:59,770
the idea of theta value is to keep an

104
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:04,360
open door from the analyst so we the

105
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:06,700
analyst can set the system and can tune

106
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:11,620
the system so it is a way for tuning the

107
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:15,159
system I develop a small application to

108
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,950
test the algorithm the I've training

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,040
with on machine with cortex a number of

110
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,469
analyzers commercial and free and a

111
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,310
Linux environment to run in the the

112
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:30,630
application developer in Python in

113
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,700
version 3 the name is Seligenstadt

114
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:39,969
agency sound microorganism is very small

115
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:41,960
and is its DNA consists only of 942

116
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:47,270
cells so it's really easy

117
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:50,270
to study the aging of the cell so this

118
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:54,169
is some result I put it in in the system

119
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:57,139
a list of indicators and we can see two

120
00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:00,469
two lines the blue lines the blue line

121
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:02,840
is the average rate calculated and the

122
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:07,220
red line is the trend of all ratings

123
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:11,049
calculated so below the blue line we can

124
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:16,310
see we discarded the indicators and

125
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:19,550
above the blue line we can see the bioc

126
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,789
we are going to keep as malicious the

127
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:26,930
result the result was to understand if

128
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:30,380
the algorithm is correct and that's why

129
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:35,000
I put it in the list 6 ipv4 for sure

130
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:38,289
malicious about 30 suspicious and here

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,069
we can see some results so from 1 to 65

132
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:47,479
we discarded the indicators from 67 to

133
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:53,060
100 the indicators were really malicious

134
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:55,460
so the system in this case was some

135
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,740
other tests we can do under the system

136
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,138
is bearing the number and quality of the

137
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:03,320
threat intelligence feeds and varying

138
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,750
the quality of a jacinta of associated

139
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,690
risk and varying the - worldwide tell

140
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,300
you and why not estimate how much feeds

141
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,849
are collaborative in same set of the IOC

142
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,610
because the system wants to be a

143
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:19,880
collaborative system so it's really

144
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,979
important to evaluate the quality of the

145
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,289
threat intelligence feeds and they're

146
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:27,949
recognized groups of indicators with a

147
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:32,000
common pattern I started to to do some

148
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:35,270
tests with the neural network and some

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,640
kind of cluster iteration because when I

150
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,370
ran the system I got a much much more

151
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,429
information from the threat intelligence

152
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:46,550
feed in example for the IP address we

153
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:52,579
can consider to evaluate who is output

154
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:56,180
and we can try to understand if groups

155
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:58,689
of the indicator belongs to the same

156
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,630
to attack to infrastructure in example

157
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:06,139
so this is our idea about the IOC

158
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,980
lifecycle hello your work so I study and

159
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:17,360
it's just another idea and let's see if

160
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:18,740
you have some question or yeah yeah just

161
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,880
one quick thing in one of the slides you

162
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,860
mentioned that you're taking into

163
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,800
account the average score of the other

164
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,329
data that you have in your database is

165
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,859
it something that you regularly update

166
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:32,029
or is it something that you do on demand

167
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,970
when you're requesting data no the idea

168
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,660
is around the system every on the same

169
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:41,839
list and it's important because you you

170
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,719
have to have just one is a list because

171
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,180
one ap today is malicious in three weeks

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,670
maybe is clear but in one month maybe

173
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:53,000
come back as malicious so the idea is

174
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:57,410
around a system I don't know every next

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,480
time but always on the same list and put

176
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,480
in up Andrea you see in the same list

177
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:10,790
yeah it's about on the sidelines many

178
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,740
questions except when I saw your graph

179
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:18,880
earlier on the average then the average

180
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:20,930
was a constant value so I would just

181
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,079
when I saw that I was I was just

182
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,339
wondering why it's not moving it's kind

183
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:32,479
of the same lines but I'm still like

184
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:34,880
stuck on on why it's the same this is

185
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,519
the average so is a constant values the

186
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,260
average of all ratings calculated of

187
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:47,300
already's yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

188
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:49,399
yes yes at this time yes yeah and here

189
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,949
is good also evaluate maybe some

190
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,560
standard deviation with standard

191
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:56,959
deviation here you can understand if all

192
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,430
that intelligence feeds are in which way

193
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:04,579
are collaborative or not in fact here

194
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:09,290
not all that intelligence feeds we're

195
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:14,089
really collaborative because I put some

196
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:17,019
six ipv4 malicious but they are coming

197
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:20,029
from the apt groups oh maybe not

198
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:24,110
portrait intelligence we knew about that

199
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:27,050
that IP yeah it was just a test to

200
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,120
understand if if the system were was a

201
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:37,609
collaborative between all that

202
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:39,920
intelligence feed and do you ponder it

203
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,290
with the confidence that that's given by

204
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,620
Miss pond defeat like some miss power

205
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,800
more reliable than others like if I

206
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,389
bring a feed from the honey net project

207
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,279
that just has data for money but the

208
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,680
confidence would be very low cuz it just

209
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,170
for money pods and if it's feeds from I

210
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,719
don't know that Interpol has the best

211
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,370
public feed ever that's as if the

212
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,800
highest confidence ever so it is

213
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:08,779
something you wanna do you thought for

214
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,660
the the idea is used threat intelligence

215
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:14,050
feed so you can use Miss pass another

216
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,050
feat

217
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,849
just a small question do you already

218
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,520
have some ideas on how you will

219
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,650
implement it in Misbah how will it and

220
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:40,150
great your small tool that you wrote

221
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:42,819
with misfit self so maybe we should have

222
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,520
a chat later on because we will see at a

223
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:55,090
later one but we have some ways to help

224
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:57,250
you integrate it with a business my

225
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,660
question is also in relation to the to

226
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,400
the data and sometimes and maybe I'm

227
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,469
misunderstanding but your it seems

228
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,680
you're talking about miss as a source

229
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,320
while I see more miss as a place which

230
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,530
aggregates data from various sources and

231
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,410
it aggregates as well data from sources

232
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:16,990
that I deem very trustworthy and from

233
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,719
sources that I did very non trustworthy

234
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,760
and very much polluting and so on so I'm

235
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,160
wondering in in which way you couldn't

236
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,160
integrate these elements into the models

237
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:32,500
you've made of you looked at through to

238
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:36,670
help defining that that the rating I

239
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:39,610
think you can integrate both in what way

240
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:43,540
because you can use mist as a threat

241
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:47,050
intelligence feed if it's as it has the

242
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:51,660
whole variable so DLP DHS name is part

243
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:54,880
present or you can you can use wisp as a

244
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:59,319
database but the most important thing

245
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:03,130
you use more than one feed because

246
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:07,300
collaboration is needed so miss could be

247
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,950
a source or could be a way where you

248
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,699
integrate everything because in the

249
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:16,660
misty you have different sources so it's

250
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:21,000
the same it could be the same for now

251
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,000
it's just an idea so we are working on

252
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,860
okay prediction you mean yeah because

253
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:40,620
this kind of systems or recommender

254
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:45,370
system is used to make a prediction so

255
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:48,580
you may hear right okay yeah because we

256
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:53,890
don't want predict anything I want to be

257
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:57,450
sure so I don't want make prediction

258
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,449
about an indicator of compromise

259
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:09,580
yeah at this moment I don't trust to the

260
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:14,279
machine learning for this problem no

261
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:18,760
because I am Not sure about because

262
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:28,540
depend on the source so you have to you

263
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:29,920
have to trust to the source in tradition

264
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,709
to the machine learning you mentioned

265
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,740
and mentioned now which kind of elements

266
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:38,290
would you be planning to use for for

267
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,660
machine learning because just I know the

268
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,849
eye you see the say an IP address is not

269
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,480
a good element because a machine cannot

270
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:49,240
differentiate or take into take the

271
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,360
variables into accounts to put it into

272
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:56,650
is this neural network but which which

273
00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:00,640
elements of extra metadata would you use

274
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:04,240
to feed into a machine learning right

275
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,430
now I don't know so I don't know as to

276
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:12,029
join Marshall learning with this problem

277
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:12,029
I think it's C it's a little bit hard

278
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,559
thank you very much

279
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,559
you
