1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:11,030
so thank you for being here and for

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:13,309
sitting already so my presentation will

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,419
be a bit about visualization ization of

4
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:19,730
data of Miss of course it's sometimes a

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,039
challenge when you when you work with a

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,599
larger subset of data and you want to

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,160
get something out of it so this is not

8
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,590
about putting data into mist it's more

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,448
like trying to use as a consumer use use

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,590
the data that's over there and try to

11
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:39,140
make sense try to do analysis on it and

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:44,480
etc so yeah this is this is an event

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:47,480
from one of the mists we see some

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,330
audience information we see some some

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,910
galaxies we see some relations and so on

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,760
so it's it's actually quite interesting

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,980
so I mentioned the galaxies there are a

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,110
lot of extra information in relation to

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,779
the the attacker what techniques that

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:07,760
they use what malware family was used

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,590
and so on so but these galaxies when you

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,120
click on then when you open them you get

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,570
a lot of meta data you get a lot of

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,890
extra information but how do you look at

25
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,580
it how do you visualize the information

26
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:22,640
now maybe let's go to misfit cells it

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,759
will be probably nicer so when you

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
scroll down you can have a can a very

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,490
neat feature here it's called an event

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,210
graph a semi program that and actually

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,509
when people write things quite nicely

32
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,520
you can see all the attributes and

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,640
objects relation and the relation

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,110
between the other one in the other and

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,190
when you zoom in you see that actually

36
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:51,380
this file this downloads this XA and

37
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,000
this other XA this is used by the other

38
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,158
so it tells something about the story

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,810
when you have malicious attachments for

40
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,750
example with an email with malicious

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,390
attachments that attachment drops drops

42
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,490
a file executed by neri downloads things

43
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,729
from a specific CNC and so on and so on

44
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,758
so we have all these relationships and

45
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:12,170
relationship described in a very non we

46
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,549
were talking about user friendliness

47
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,660
before but if you look at the

48
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,920
relationships here

49
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:21,620
you see a reference in here so it's used

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,510
by object 4306 scene so that doesn't

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,390
really make sense that's great my semi

52
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,269
ad it's kind of a visualization to on

53
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:33,470
those relations now

54
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,660
let's we have here a file we can expand

55
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,000
its VCF some checksum speakers and file

56
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,430
names but what do you want what what now

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,350
I have this great graph I'd like to look

58
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:47,030
further on this on this hash on just

59
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:49,040
checksum he also mentions there are some

60
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,730
relationships related events on this pin

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,410
in here so I'd also like to to see what

62
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,290
about the other what about the other

63
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:01,340
agents so cool miss also provides a

64
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:04,880
correlation graph so here let's give it

65
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,290
seconds where we see related events so

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,000
quite cool oh we see there are

67
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,970
difference events on this missed

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,960
instance and there are some things let's

69
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:18,500
move it around to bits so my smooth is

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,350
here move it's here so yeah I have a

71
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,770
more that's a good view but if I look

72
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:27,620
and another one yeah this is maybe a bit

73
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,400
less like I mean it's beautiful it's

74
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,800
kind of arts but I mean I'm just a human

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,900
eye I have like I can maybe remember I

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,380
keep like five or six items in my view

77
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,780
at once

78
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,790
so I would like to remove maybe most of

79
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:52,910
them so I only keep those that have a

80
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:54,380
value for me so this is this is really

81
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,170
one of the great things with miss is

82
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,150
that Miss knows or the software data

83
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,130
logic knows miss Pitt's not the answer

84
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,110
it's a it's a piece it's a part in this

85
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,799
little in the answer and that's where

86
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,510
our role is or we play is like we have

87
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,500
other tools sometimes tools that are

88
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,540
better for specific things and because

89
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,700
of the openness of Miss which is just

90
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,099
like allowing you to put data in it's in

91
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,260
an automated fashion to browse the data

92
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,300
through a human interface like a web

93
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,340
browser but you can also access the data

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,320
through an automated fashion and that's

95
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,979
why we starts to put a clue with our

96
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,540
favorite tools

97
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,250
it's a few I don't know where you're

98
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,260
sitting but I love you and I hate you

99
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,840
with - it's marvelous

100
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,110
but it's evolving so fast it's sometimes

101
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,549
tough to follow and in this case in

102
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,370
relation to visualization

103
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,830
I'm myself I'm using multigo I don't

104
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,720
want to do any commercial advertisements

105
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,460
about tools just a tool I use and I want

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,800
to glue it with miss and so that's what

107
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,049
I try to do of course I wasn't the first

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
so some people did the word before but

109
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,490
well miss evolves create objects

110
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,470
relationships galaxies and so on so

111
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,490
these were not added so I I spent some

112
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:10,250
time to rework it and redo it what about

113
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,110
the use cases um let's let's say you're

114
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,090
in your data visualization tool and you

115
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,280
want to know okay I hear I have an IP I

116
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,419
have a checksum or something is it

117
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,400
something I already know

118
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,500
that's one of the questions you ask and

119
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,810
you can start looking on other data

120
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,060
sources VT or order but is it something

121
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,210
I know so you would like to know is it

122
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,740
is it in miss poor notes once once you

123
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,810
know that you probably want to explore

124
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,750
further we showed a few examples through

125
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,460
the myths web UI in exploring the data

126
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:42,919
further but you want to also do it with

127
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:44,539
your favorites tool we also mentioned in

128
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,789
the web interface those relationships

129
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:49,010
between the objects these are really

130
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:51,229
great but actually it goes even further

131
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,570
there are relationships and the missed

132
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,880
models and galaxies models they have it

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,710
it's not all shown in the interface but

134
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,690
our relationships between galaxies

135
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,510
between tracked extract actors and tools

136
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,130
so if you have a tool which is used by a

137
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,979
track sector actually if you look at a

138
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,960
galaxy the JSON file so the technical

139
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,300
files you see that they are actually the

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,359
relationships are related as this

141
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,640
picture uses this tool this actor is

142
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,539
similar to the other other actor because

143
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,450
we invented 20 names for the same actors

144
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:26,270
we have TTP's we mentions them a bit

145
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,740
earlier that attack and those ATP's they

146
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,930
also have a relationship to such

147
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,640
specific actors and and and and and

148
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,440
campaigns so there's a lot of

149
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,810
relationship and those relationships

150
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,880
they really make sense when you look at

151
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,530
it from a visual perspective because we

152
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,780
are not really good at visualizing

153
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,460
everything in our heads we need

154
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,880
schools we need we need to see it in

155
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:52,520
front of our eyes so these are a few use

156
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:55,460
cases so um just before going into multi

157
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:00,099
go use who here has ever used multi go

158
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,690
oh that's okay who uses it daily or

159
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,900
weekly okay we need to talk because

160
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,180
that's one of my final questions is I'm

161
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,099
I'm not a multi your expert I use it now

162
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,350
and then and because I don't have enough

163
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,210
time of course but I'd love to hear some

164
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,000
feedback on use and use cases you have

165
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,729
so these can be added into the the

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,070
transforms so multi go is kind of this

167
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,050
visualization tool you can add entries

168
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,969
here you can add IP addresses the main

169
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,800
names file names whatever you want and

170
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,620
just create relationships in the

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,860
interface but it works with what we call

172
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,750
transforms so you have a certain data in

173
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,640
here for example an IP address you can

174
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,040
either right mouse click or look at your

175
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,680
death menu and you can query other data

176
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,669
sources like is this is this known in

177
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,500
this data source or not here we see a

178
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,849
virus total for example a checksum of

179
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,100
course you would look into a virus total

180
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:55,729
for the for for the existence or the

181
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,710
check sum so the principle and the

182
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,710
concept is the same with miss so I

183
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,539
mentioned do we want to know if

184
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,090
something is in miss let's take these

185
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,620
attributes here or these three one is

186
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,890
the domain name and those two are IP

187
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,570
addresses I can just query and ask is is

188
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,969
it in mispronounced and actually

189
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,570
immediately we see here the green mark

190
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,950
which indicates that these are in miss

191
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,080
well actually one was automatically

192
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,940
expanded and here this one doesn't have

193
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,599
the marking so I know this one is not

194
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,850
yet in my miss now if I have this one

195
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,850
but maybe in which miss event is it's

196
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:34,490
now I know it's there but I don't know

197
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:38,270
in which I'm events well I can just ask

198
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:41,719
and the tool will show me the related or

199
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,490
relevance miss pearance which of course

200
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:50,300
also has a green marking because it's in

201
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:52,520
this from there we have so in Miss we

202
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,770
have the concept of attributes we

203
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,840
objects we have object attributes we

204
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:00,400
have relationships we have tanks we have

205
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,950
galaxies so just to make everything I

206
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,990
would say easier for the analysts I'm a

207
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,270
transforms for each of the different use

208
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,030
cases or different needs to expand on

209
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:23,449
specific data because if you just expand

210
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:25,189
on everything it's it becomes a bit a

211
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:30,440
mess so you don't want to do that every

212
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:32,240
time so that that's one of the things

213
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,160
with with working with a visualisation

214
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,350
tool you will expand the data you have

215
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,760
you will start selecting the things that

216
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,260
are not relevant and then maybe you

217
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,020
throw them away because you want to get

218
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,420
it out of your view and so in here we

219
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,939
can choose I want to expend everything I

220
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,569
want just to look at the objects or not

221
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,610
let's look at another events in here

222
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:54,800
already what's the number and we can say

223
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,660
okay have let's have a look at the

224
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,370
objects that are in this event so these

225
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:05,290
are all the objects and from these we

226
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:11,780
can ask let's let's show the attributes

227
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:13,370
let's give him a few seconds and in here

228
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,430
we also see the relationships so this

229
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:20,150
file is used by this one this one is

230
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:22,400
actually this one downloads the other

231
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,650
there are a few double arrows because of

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,720
the way I used it so we also see all the

233
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,420
relationships and now if I wants to

234
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,970
maybe delete some data and change the

235
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,630
view I see actually I'm not interested

236
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:45,710
in I don't know in those files and

237
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:47,540
hashes let's go back in it's a bit

238
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:50,060
simplified again so it's it's something

239
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,099
dynamic but we're using our grades

240
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,810
database our great mystery and we use

241
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,810
the power of all those relationships

242
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:03,440
does that make sense of it I don't know

243
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:05,870
yeah okay good another example we were

244
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,370
talking about mitre attack earlier

245
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,690
Alexander was mentioned if there's a lot

246
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,089
of work that has been done also

247
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,550
integrating in the intimus but also from

248
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:15,020
a kind of a step backwards like what

249
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,670
about the other technologies that could

250
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,230
benefit from the same thing and actually

251
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,120
that's a nice thing because of the way

252
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,860
miss implements things or the miss

253
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,690
project implement things it's very

254
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,000
generic that means that any tool any

255
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,210
glue you create automatically also

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,400
benefits from these enhancements a few

257
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,110
months ago mitre published a new version

258
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,449
of attack with some extensions

259
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,330
extensions and so on and these were also

260
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,670
ones published on the repository

261
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,710
available for any tool these were also

262
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,839
immediately available for the multigo

263
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:49,970
extension so in this case let's say

264
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:53,900
we're looking for a galaxy I created it

265
00:11:49,970 --> 00:12:06,110
mainly here in the list but I can in

266
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:08,449
drag and drop in the in mitre attack

267
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,570
there's kind of a technique which is

268
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:14,810
called binary padding so we can actually

269
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,390
we can just type a substring or we can

270
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,130
ask it and actually so he shows actually

271
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,860
searching in all the galaxies he found

272
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,209
to two results which is one of the

273
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,959
course of actions and the other is the

274
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,089
attack pattern

275
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:32,150
I'm actually not interested in in those

276
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:39,920
two and now I want to explore further

277
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:41,569
the attack pattern so here we actually

278
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,469
have different elements we have

279
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:48,380
intrusion shots intrusion sets malware's

280
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,420
we have a course of actions again

281
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,189
because these are relationships in

282
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,079
relation to this attack pattern these

283
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,550
were all defined by matter but also

284
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:01,000
import it in the galaxies in those

285
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:04,339
relations let's say we want to explore

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:11,180
external malware what about the

287
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:15,530
relationships of this one so here we see

288
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,859
that external has different attack

289
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,860
pattern

290
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:26,839
we can start pivoting on its we also see

291
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:28,970
in here that external tool which is

292
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,209
another galaxy is similar to mitre

293
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,670
attackee external s and we have the

294
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:37,459
intrusion sets which also has a little

295
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:41,689
relationship because it uses it so from

296
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:48,380
here we can for example choose to delete

297
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:53,990
all those blue ones happen because it's

298
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:55,990
not relevant for us and now we can

299
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,490
continue to pivot on these elements

300
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:04,639
because this is actually of interest for

301
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:06,800
me here we see he grouped a lot of

302
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,370
attack patterns we see the relation to

303
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,639
the tractor sofa C which indeed is a

304
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:18,110
similar name to a PT 28 and we can

305
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:22,010
continue there what we can also do is

306
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:24,310
from there we can query Monsieur and of

307
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,620
course this is where the demo gods are

308
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,479
annoying and we can ask okay what are

309
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,339
the Mizpah vents that are related to

310
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,579
this galaxy this is unfortunate just a

311
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:37,880
testament on my local machine I had some

312
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:40,040
issues with the internet connection so

313
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,189
and from here on we have we're pivoting

314
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,620
from actors techniques and so on and we

315
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,449
are looking at miss data which allows us

316
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:57,290
again dynamically to visualize and use

317
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:59,420
the data to go further and further yeah

318
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,370
this is another example with purely Maya

319
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,019
attack where actually you see

320
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,690
relationships thanks to all these

321
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:09,110
relations in the galaxy you here we have

322
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:12,620
an intrusion sets apt 232 we have a

323
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,360
malware and we see now it's grouped so

324
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,250
you can't really see it on the text but

325
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,720
it's it's it's using similar techniques

326
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:23,540
also with others so we have the emissary

327
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,010
panda probably I think so they use

328
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,290
common elements so again with the

329
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,899
visualization of the data you can see

330
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,889
much more than just like reading

331
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:35,800
text on the screen so this is just a

332
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:38,680
multi get transform it's open source of

333
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,050
course so the code is on github to

334
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,138
install it is relatively simple and just

335
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,748
using as I mentioned earlier if you have

336
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:48,129
feedback and IDs just feature requests

337
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:51,100
or if you can't you want to contribute

338
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:54,279
yourself feel free to submit them one of

339
00:15:51,100 --> 00:16:01,629
the other multi-core integrations that

340
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:03,670
exists is now miss Pico I think that one

341
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:05,709
allows you to edit things from this

342
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,420
that's maybe a feature I'd like to add

343
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:09,429
in this one too

344
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,410
it's it's a bit tough because of the

345
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:15,850
multi-core limitations but the feedback

346
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,589
is really really welcome so for me this

347
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,420
really helps me to visualize the data

348
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,759
that I have in this will also use the

349
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,550
other elements of the galaxies to to

350
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,649
make things better yeah easier to

351
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,359
understand so I think that's it it's not

352
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:30,490
much it's just a small integration but I

353
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,139
think it shows the power of myth and the

354
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:38,170
power of integrating things with other

355
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:40,770
tools so pending any questions no

356
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,250
questions ok thank you very much

357
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,250
