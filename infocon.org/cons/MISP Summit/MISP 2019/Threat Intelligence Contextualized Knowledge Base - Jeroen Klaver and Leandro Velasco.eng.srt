1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,429
hello everybody thanks for stay here

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,780
he's actually a bit late now I can

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:13,450
imagine your brains are a bit fry as

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,470
well so we're going to make it fun as

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:20,710
well so as much as like Tokina a lot

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,259
also we're gonna have some nice meme so

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,449
laugh a little bit so again thank very

8
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:27,580
much especially thank you to the MIS

9
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,289
team to accept our top really happy to

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,299
be here we have been following this

11
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,450
project for question time so we are

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,160
really happy to import so what are we

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:40,180
going to talk we're going to go our way

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:45,339
of using ms-13 traditions contextualize

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,789
knowledge place but yes ourselves M

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,120
Leandre

17
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:50,980
his room we both have a similar

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,660
background which is the same math degree

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,029
now we are both working for kiplyn

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,928
security as a security researchers

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:01,329
that's Netherlands um but after school

22
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:03,100
we took slightly different paths I went

23
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,809
more for the endpoint analysis an

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:19,030
antivirus he will move for the soak and

25
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:20,619
network analysis so we so one day when

26
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:28,000
he was still working for the shock and I

27
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:31,780
was working for the I'm gonna stay here

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,250
so okay so I was working for security

29
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,860
research team and we were like how can

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,710
we help each other how can I help the

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,390
sub to have better like incidence of

32
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,399
error alerts because they were oh yes

33
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,140
nice something is wrong but what's wrong

34
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,909
and how that connects something like he

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,390
mentioned before like something is bad

36
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,149
an IP

37
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,790
yeah but IP related to what threat this

38
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,950
is connected to like a malware is it

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,649
connected to like never wear attack so

40
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,390
what's going on so we like research from

41
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,070
my low miss is a really nice project

42
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,380
like a couple of years ago

43
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,719
oh yeah let's let's give a try and we

44
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,908
start looking at the data that means

45
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,130
consume especially this free data and

46
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,900
willow at this has some potential so we

47
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,090
thought that time we were

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:18,040
working with Olimpo another

49
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,750
the otx like Network and we were like

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,109
okay we can put some of our events

51
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:26,080
towards the otx Network and like that we

52
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,349
can share our intelligence towards our

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,840
customers but it was not enough the

54
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,340
other day we were just sharing some

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,110
indication of compromise that we were

56
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,450
consuming from really nice sources but

57
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,670
we didn't know that if they were true we

58
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,459
couldn't verify them we need to add some

59
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,880
more layers into that to make something

60
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:48,250
useful with it so one day we sit

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,109
together in a nice room ok let's plan

62
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,870
something we need a more complex

63
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,510
framework multiple pieces working

64
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,190
together to like verify the data extract

65
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,840
more data how our own threat

66
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,750
intelligence because just consume an

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,440
open source one is not enough so we

68
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,610
start drawing things and we have flow so

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,269
what are we going to do how I'm gonna

70
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,069
share it and when crazy we read until

71
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,799
our manager say like yeah this is nice

72
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,200
but complicated how can I defend this

73
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,239
with a management board so like we try

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,630
to simplify them we remove some of the

75
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,730
lines have we had like less complex but

76
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,560
they was still not enough especially for

77
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,980
like a presentation like yeah it looks

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,269
like too much like though my heart so we

79
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,030
her like a nicer like schema now and

80
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:38,410
this is our platform or this is what we

81
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,579
want to because we are still working

82
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:45,010
with it it is a walking project chorus

83
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,739
project sorry um yes oh

84
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,200
the idea of today for us is to Spain how

85
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,230
we came here what we have what we plan

86
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,959
to have and yes hoping that more people

87
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,450
here might use these ideas implement in

88
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,040
their customers of the compounds so

89
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,958
let's go with the first component in

90
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,418
they of course it's open source

91
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,829
intelligence and it's not just the open

92
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,510
source intelligence that we have free

93
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,209
means which is great and it has really

94
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,489
nice sources like the circle them really

95
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,639
like that we also try to have our own

96
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,560
like scraper so we have the Cape sandbox

97
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,239
scraper we try to extract an indication

98
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,300
of compromise from known malware

99
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:25,210
families we also look at some things of

100
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,710
otx I would push it inside of our myth

101
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,000
so we can analyze that and then

102
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,068
sometimes weary push it back to the

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,250
objects but with some of our own

104
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:35,410
enrichment then we also have some circle

105
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,050
of course and Twitter because people are

106
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,889
really nice and share a lot then we'll

107
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,330
go to our second big input source and

108
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,400
this is trying certificate transparency

109
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,289
and I don't know if you are aware of

110
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,388
this project but basically I'm going to

111
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:52,750
try to explain quickly it's an

112
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:54,910
initiative done by Google to try to

113
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,780
patch the certificate authority as a

114
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,160
cell TLS structure because what happened

115
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,739
a couple of years ago with this note are

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,660
really changed many people mind like we

117
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,780
cannot just trust the system we need to

118
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:10,240
monitor it we need to be like we need to

119
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,448
be some elite training there like some

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,560
analysis so what happened now is that

121
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,710
Google says like what if we have like a

122
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,270
repository where all the certificates

123
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,190
that are being issue in the world are

124
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,948
also pushing to this repository so

125
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,440
anybody can just look at them and spot

126
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,960
some strange things like hey why is it

127
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,030
not are issuing certificates for Google

128
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,880
that's not the case that they shouldn't

129
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,739
be doing so the idea is that now we have

130
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,810
another layer that is public accessible

131
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,320
for everybody they can review the data

132
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,240
and do some proper aleady but for us why

133
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,060
is this interesting for us basically we

134
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,310
look at this project as a database of

135
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,770
certificates and we can extract the

136
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:54,070
common name for so for us it's a nice

137
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:57,190
way to get access to domain names now

138
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,770
use these to extract the data from it we

139
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,500
enrich it with some of our own ideas we

140
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,060
push into an elastic search and then we

141
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,070
create some alarms we create some

142
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,409
analyses we hunt with it so here we have

143
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,449
some examples might not be easy to read

144
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:13,120
but basically we have some punic

145
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,789
analysis we do some entropy analysis on

146
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,550
top of the domain names we also look at

147
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:20,440
like if Twitter is supposed to be issued

148
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,110
by this particular Authority why it is

149
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,789
another like rogue kind of certificate

150
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,750
so we use this to hunt for phishing

151
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:31,169
sites or sometimes malicious in general

152
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,669
here have one nice example of like a

153
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,339
scheme they're trying to do here like

154
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,839
you see get verified Twitter but if you

155
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:41,320
pay a lot of attention you see that is a

156
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,730
small thing on top of a I like that

157
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,890
if you're if you're not really pay

158
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,750
attention I get up completely shade but

159
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,360
trust me it's not I did trigger an

160
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,980
incident in my company because then we

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:58,570
have this one and it has another trick

162
00:06:50,980 --> 00:07:00,250
if you petition here they up em a pseudo

163
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,840
Maine on top of the main so people with

164
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,490
a smartphone or they are not really

165
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,469
intentions a knife that's my bank does

166
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,720
enough but it don't look at the entire

167
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,970
URL they simply just look at the first

168
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,860
part especially useful when you have a

169
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,360
small phone screen because you're like

170
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,460
you see has a first part and the rest

171
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,250
like is gone you don't pay attention and

172
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,200
Safari for example that is Google try to

173
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,600
improve that and they show the last part

174
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,280
so you it's easier to spot I basically

175
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,560
use the system to extract this sort of

176
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,229
intelligence we see some malicious men

177
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,620
and we like dig into it I will try to

178
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:35,680
charge bit more but this approach that

179
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,530
we chose ago we will add this is the

180
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,380
things we we want for our platform but

181
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,900
sometimes you know like things called

182
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,400
different size and like company has some

183
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,650
we request and that was the case with

184
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,630
the following one day we were working

185
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,099
with our previous project doing some

186
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,719
hunting and somebody came from market

187
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,670
and said hey would be nice to have a

188
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,610
like a cyber that map you know like

189
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:59,560
something that is showing really a like

190
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,990
80 inch screen now we can be like to

191
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,810
prowl our sock is blocking threads and

192
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,020
hackers I'm like so basically he won up

193
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,680
your map and like wanna like Korea thing

194
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,909
is like this is what you really want

195
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,470
it's exactly what word is this great

196
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,090
like we put in a keyboard screen

197
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,390
actually put two screens with the same

198
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,969
data

199
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:21,580
okay we're like not really happy about

200
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,669
it but is that's what you want we can do

201
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,770
it but we have trick we use real data

202
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,859
and that was like for us was a nice

203
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,570
excuse to have our honeypot Network

204
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,090
because up until now we were like no who

205
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,250
needs that that's a lot of resources we

206
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,500
don't really need that we like okay but

207
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,900
now you wanna pew pew map so we can make

208
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,570
a FIFA map but also use the backing of

209
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,340
the data so now we deploy across the

210
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,200
world we have like 90 different honey

211
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,330
pots distributed in different like

212
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,100
vendors and that give us a lot of

213
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,500
interesting data because you can see

214
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,850
like what is been massive attack

215
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,220
basically with

216
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,220
trick you shut the data Brunel and reach

217
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,730
it with ideas we have and we also have

218
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,250
some automatic alerting and some of the

219
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,380
things we can say because of this he

220
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,790
likes some of like the vBulletin now we

221
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,520
can see like oh this has been massively

222
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,500
exploited and we have real data real

223
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,510
proof of this happen it's not we are not

224
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,270
relying on a third party or a vendor

225
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:23,260
sets or like yet which is something same

226
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:25,510
with this this thing PHP and the

227
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,120
interesting part of this one it's not

228
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,800
just the exploitation we also know they

229
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,960
are hosts in the second stage somewhere

230
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,819
and what if we get access to that second

231
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,980
stage then we can understand a bit more

232
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:40,810
what is what this thread is about so now

233
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,140
we have a lot of data from different

234
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:47,949
sources some are more than others but at

235
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,630
least we have a big input of like like a

236
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,370
resource it's an now you don't even

237
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,000
explain what we do with some of these

238
00:09:51,370 --> 00:10:00,670
resources so back then I will still work

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,670
in his talk and still working on cutting

240
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,890
the thread Intel systems of customers

241
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,740
and just resolving all kinds of

242
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,560
incidents yeah Leo kinda shows up a

243
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,060
system and all this new data and that

244
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,339
gives us like the problem we want to

245
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,479
process it but mainly it takes a lot of

246
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:23,220
time to verify at the context there so

247
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,220
that was not really working for us

248
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,100
so actually we want to do more and we

249
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,390
needed some automation there to get it

250
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,780
working

251
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,880
and we set some points first okay what

252
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,220
do we need like first of all we want

253
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,590
something that just vote for us like

254
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,640
modulars or a goodie can work on it and

255
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:47,620
we look in each other's ways and freely

256
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,480
party based most of us know how to

257
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:56,290
program in Python so we have set some

258
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:59,220
goals there so actually we ended up with

259
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:03,099
the stop framework the point server

260
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,590
company and it gave us what we kind of

261
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,090
needed item based framework which

262
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,470
automatically

263
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,800
processes

264
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,620
payloads or other data and it gives like

265
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,229
a Yarra based flow control which is

266
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,700
really important for us because then we

267
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:24,340
can keep on using some standards and

268
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:28,690
well use the stuff that community

269
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:32,350
already produces so that kind of ends up

270
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:36,040
in this kind of flow diagram start with

271
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,840
input filtering mechanism then we have

272
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,750
the dispatcher they are based on and

273
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,880
based on what dispatch this because sent

274
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,200
to workers keep repeating the circle

275
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,090
until it's done we are guys

276
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,150
towards elf is those be like two days or

277
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:56,320
whatever it's just so we better use some

278
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:59,470
examples so let's say yeah it's like

279
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,920
form a page being you find some base64

280
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:09,060
string nobody now now stay what is this

281
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:12,209
so this ends up in the system and then

282
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,010
the filter you can see like new hash

283
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:17,650
verifies to hash this just looks simple

284
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,840
filtering mechanism ok new hash I don't

285
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,030
know this one yet so let's keep on

286
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,250
progressing

287
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,770
the dispatcher see is oh it's base64 and

288
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,290
it decodes it on this case you see it's

289
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:33,370
a PowerShell who download something from

290
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:39,099
Empire get up vampire some malicious

291
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:42,300
script we end up and actually that

292
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,090
payload is sent again to like filter and

293
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,740
this past weekend in this time T Oh

294
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:51,630
power saw spread this time it send this

295
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,940
to our Cape sandbox to process this

296
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:59,950
payload will keep references will it

297
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:02,290
then based on the ID of previous one we

298
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,150
keep referencing way back so you can

299
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,959
always see if it is payload recent from

300
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:11,400
this other payload and that same foam

301
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,980
like the pastebin or some other source

302
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:18,880
and actually then because of the same

303
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,860
hooks execute it you get to part it you

304
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,250
can see wait there's a connection to get

305
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,080
up these partial sketch

306
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:29,060
downloading something it's at extra

307
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:33,800
contacts at maybe some maliciousness say

308
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:37,000
maybe it's worth investigating it more

309
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:42,370
so actually you now went from like

310
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,160
monkey work analysts which is not really

311
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:49,160
nice for anybody we went to like more

312
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,780
way more like murdering like car washing

313
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,420
system which we're really happy with and

314
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,730
to show that like more real life example

315
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,959
stuff we have implemented lately is

316
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:06,560
based on raffle so they post sample home

317
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,340
paste bin so we can check from there we

318
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,829
can find payload identify them then

319
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:15,380
extracted dll from their American new

320
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:19,910
round we can extract country if we push

321
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,460
that to our elk which results and in you

322
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,829
can show some you get some nice data

323
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,260
about what's going on are just looking

324
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,839
at that data so these are whitelist

325
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,300
extensions what is the files or

326
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,620
directories these will not be encrypted

327
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:40,219
by the referendum where and you can see

328
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:44,690
and there are quite some different files

329
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:47,450
in there and take a look these are like

330
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,650
most killed processes so before the

331
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,200
encryption starts it kills some

332
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,610
processes and they're like well in the

333
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,890
middle we have like the backup server

334
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,020
which makes quite some sense in a

335
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,449
ransomware kill the backup server first

336
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,910
backup process first and then starting

337
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,130
drifting you get there's more chance if

338
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:08,569
you get like you're in somewhere you run

339
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:12,740
some in the Indians and although it's

340
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,580
also quite nice we can follow some of

341
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,220
the campaigns

342
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,470
there are these in the cool felt so you

343
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,410
can infer groups and campaigns of those

344
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:27,110
groups to more active who's doing

345
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:31,310
different kind of attacks or different

346
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:35,350
type of companies maybe even more or

347
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,349
less like or filtering system

348
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:45,260
and from there we try to get the output

349
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:47,630
image we won't be here well and from

350
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,640
miss it's for less it's for us it's a

351
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,730
database which is really useful for us

352
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,699
but the important part is like certain

353
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:59,170
blue everything around it so off the

354
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:04,730
data that Leo as its fallen L we try to

355
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:08,680
extract from Yelp using primates get the

356
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:11,450
data out there and feed it miss we have

357
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,380
something like a fair fire which is he

358
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:18,649
was explaining mostly or the earlier

359
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,380
presentation it's from you data really

360
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:25,850
customer data finds is it already out

361
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:30,050
there is that do some retro Hans or at

362
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:32,360
least say ok this IP for example we

363
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,209
never see it and our cost my data it's

364
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,670
fairly safe to say to defeat least it

365
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,529
won't get false positives it's like no

366
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,140
security data at all but at least if you

367
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:47,000
do not cost multi cleaning of course

368
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:49,400
false positives and we do some with

369
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,600
content creation and we try to take

370
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,310
towards like some like usual standards

371
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,820
stake Sigma

372
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:02,150
I'm sure Tata Guerra just to make it

373
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,120
like again more common and easy to

374
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,800
dispute later although this part is

375
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,899
something we are now really working on

376
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:16,339
with other departments in company that

377
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:18,050
is really working so that gives us most

378
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,198
of its picture actually with the outputs

379
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,480
the buff picture is for the feeds kind

380
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:28,160
of discuss is already in slope huge part

381
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:32,330
now and then we end up with like reports

382
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,510
which should be orange because it's like

383
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,460
tactical reports we're not there yet

384
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,520
that's something we won't work on that's

385
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,010
a future work for us to really start

386
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,120
losing report and tell about like what

387
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:49,120
are the trends more management likes

388
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,120
report

389
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,159
we really want to work on more Red Hat

390
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,330
information in this system we were

391
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,580
really closely together with pen testers

392
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,310
we're in the same department same floor

393
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,129
so really want them to start adding also

394
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,179
to the system with their knowledge and

395
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,330
probably use more or less the attack

396
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:14,450
framework for that to have their

397
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,129
knowledge base also somehow get it image

398
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,800
or at least start combining all the

399
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:23,060
information so that's really goes we

400
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,669
want to add so it's like a wrap of Russ

401
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:29,320
more or less like going out for a year

402
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:31,880
now you're really trying to build this

403
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,580
for us it really gave us like central

404
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,600
database and a place to put our fat

405
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,550
Intel we got like way better a few with

406
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,370
all the information and how things can

407
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,680
move together than before

408
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,659
the soccer analysts can get better

409
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,790
contacts because it's not just an alarm

410
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,990
and an IP and they need to Google why it

411
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:56,870
is hit and hopefully find something this

412
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:00,980
can just go to mess and find why is it

413
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:03,919
there today we are many more happier and

414
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,660
our roadmap is like lots of stuff stuff

415
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,720
that's really being discussed here it's

416
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,170
more on sightings and the decaying is

417
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:16,870
really interesting also for us and get

418
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:19,970
more insight in the data we already have

419
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:24,459
sometimes you just flop information and

420
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:29,000
yet you don't know what to do anymore

421
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:31,540
directly it that's kind of it's like our

422
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,540
platform

423
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,370
sorry if you said and I was a poor

424
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,720
listener but was it mainly just the two

425
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,580
of you or about how many yet really

426
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,470
so how did you manage to keep management

427
00:19:49,580 --> 00:20:06,530
off your back long enough to do this

428
00:19:51,470 --> 00:20:07,790
work so you have some kind of like

429
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:16,639
internal skunkworks

430
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:20,420
model that hardly we were it's also an

431
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,460
exposure we had that see there's like

432
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:26,120
well next rife the East nation some

433
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,980
persons although working on this with

434
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,429
some exposure which help see if it like

435
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,470
marketing helps us and we try to make

436
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,570
our way in that like find alliances

437
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,290
being in the company we also want to do

438
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,710
this and what will help us out and

439
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:46,220
thereby get the thumbs and thereby try

440
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:58,850
to convince upper management to let us

441
00:20:46,220 --> 00:21:00,290
play around more or less we see that if

442
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,540
nice other value and the see like always

443
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,340
we can go to conference so we can show a

444
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,290
work and we can lecture with all of

445
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:13,399
these requirements so that this is

446
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:16,780
Stella uh a lightning talk on hacking

447
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,780
your management it would be pretty cool

448
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,730
great idea

449
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:25,550
we are going to think our boss is great

450
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,630
at that we're going to propose that and

451
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,310
I think it's going to have a lot of

452
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:33,660
audience there any other question okay

453
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:38,809
thank you very much again

454
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,809
[Applause]
