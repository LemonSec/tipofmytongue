1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:12,860
hi everyone hope you're enjoying the biz

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,860
summit so far I'm Alexander this is it

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,839
I'm Alexander

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,789
this is Pitt it is in the in charge on

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,130
designing new integrations for our

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,550
platform and I'm leading the integration

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,759
steam

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,919
we're coming from eclectic IQ and before

9
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:31,439
we delve into the boring stuff I would

10
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:33,360
like to share a small story about a

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,510
documentary I watched a couple of days

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,510
ago actually I had a different story so

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:50,120
in can you please remove yourself thank

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:54,200
you so in the in the deserts of Israel

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,030
scientists noticed a very unusual thing

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,980
striped hyenas and gray wolves

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,330
were hunting to the other impacts mix

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,158
packs this is very very unusual because

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,530
predators especially in harsh

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,020
environments prefer to chase each other

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,149
out so they followed them and follow

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,200
them and they figured out what was going

23
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:16,700
on

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,229
see striped hyenas are really not

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,149
predators per se they're more scavengers

26
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,789
they hunt only five to ten percent of

27
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:28,409
their prey so they're not really

28
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:29,880
equipped at hunting unlike wolves but

29
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,389
then again wolves don't have their

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,639
superior sense of smell that that hyenas

31
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:37,408
can do and they have really strong jaws

32
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:40,859
so they can break through bones and

33
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:45,439
expose more meat so they started hunting

34
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:47,939
together compared to other two other

35
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,449
predators in the area their numbers have

36
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:55,258
skyrocketed and that shows that

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,469
cooperation in nature really works well

38
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,270
together we are here because we also

39
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,089
believe in cooperation in threat

40
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,279
intelligence and let me just share a

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,709
couple of words about our company we are

42
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:10,799
cyber threat intelligence company based

43
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,989
in Amsterdam we are developing another

44
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:14,580
eccentric threat intelligence platform

45
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:18,590
that

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,840
focused on allowing their users to to

47
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,250
match their needs and their current res

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,580
did they face in the most efficient way

49
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:36,240
and now I let Pete give you a small tour

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:38,130
over our but thanks so hello welcome so

51
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm sure many of you know what miss

52
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,519
bears because here but you're gonna who

53
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,700
we are or what we do so our platform is

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,400
for intelligent platform or a tip what

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,799
we do is help manage support the

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,280
aggregation analysis and simulation the

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,890
frat owns one always we achieve this is

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,260
using structured intelligence so we are

59
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,140
big fans of structured intelligence and

60
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,429
we based on internal data mode on sticks

61
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,769
sticks allows us to create a consistent

62
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,790
way for our users to using prey

63
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,700
contextual intelligence that cannot be

64
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:21,750
actioned or shared with whoever they

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:23,730
want so it's a little bit more on our

66
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,430
platform to understand how this

67
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,738
integrates was missed so supporting

68
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,080
intelligence needs you have aggregation

69
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,810
so we have incoming feeds into our

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,910
platform we have taxonomy and Tiger

71
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,340
Woods for classification I will use

72
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,100
dynamic date sets let who store

73
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,670
intelligence and cluster it analysis we

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,310
contain an interactive graph as use a

75
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,890
pivot for related intelligence we have

76
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,450
riches conquer searches and then you can

77
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,760
disseminate this intelligence finally

78
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:59,609
once you're done with analysis and

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:03,179
production so enough about our platform

80
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:06,950
we'll get into what we how we integrate

81
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,950
with myths and what we can actually do

82
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:17,488
so we're all lonely reasons you are here

83
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,358
probably we like these primarily because

84
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,859
of its support for exchange of

85
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,229
structured intelligence fuel

86
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,889
organizations it has a very low barrier

87
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:31,430
of entry given that is free

88
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:33,110
and open-source so organizations keep

89
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,530
their toes into cyber threat

90
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:40,099
intelligence share instead of just

91
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:43,520
sharing files like you stood so mr.

92
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:46,370
Knable though that also miss obviously

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,818
has a large and active community that

94
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:54,530
constantly brings new features that help

95
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:59,860
in sharing intelligence so for these

96
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:03,109
reasons we decided to enable our users

97
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,909
to collaborate and take advantage of the

98
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:09,500
MIS platform and as well the MIS

99
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:12,188
community itself to benefit some

100
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,199
something from our unique propositions

101
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:17,840
what we mean by that is to expose our

102
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,330
curated data and integrations portfolio

103
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,068
to the MIS paper system while at the

104
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,560
same time utilize the sharing

105
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:31,759
capabilities of MIS and provided to our

106
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:35,210
customers so we for that reason created

107
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,849
a quite miss Peck station it became like

108
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,900
very very simple like as an N richer for

109
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:45,319
for enriching i of cs on our platform

110
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:51,529
and pulling pulling related events from

111
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:54,020
certain organizations within the

112
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:57,830
extended that created an actual incoming

113
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:00,378
feed that constantly just the data or

114
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,909
correlations in authority but we also

115
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:04,789
wanted to give something back to the

116
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:07,789
community and for that reason we created

117
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:09,800
the outgoing feed which now also

118
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,810
supports actually sending back the data

119
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,229
after you probably analyze it to a

120
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,969
platform or the data that is already in

121
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,370
our platform can be shared with the

122
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:21,740
community finally we added support for

123
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,180
miss Jason so even if you cannot connect

124
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,159
our platforms for network presence

125
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:33,069
paranoid ceases and that sort of thing

126
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:33,069
you can still do a classic file exchange

127
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,680
so this is what he came up with on the

128
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,700
left side you can see a typical

129
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,340
representation of event actually

130
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,289
good miss and on the right side how it

131
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,849
actually looks once it comes into our

132
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:52,890
platform by default every missed event

133
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,840
is turned into an incident to our

134
00:06:52,890 --> 00:07:00,200
platform that's contacting and every

135
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:05,429
bility is turned into in indicator

136
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:08,310
observable pair however this works both

137
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,800
ways so if you have each 100 are they to

138
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,140
none on a event on our platform if

139
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,210
you'll be reflected mr. vice versa

140
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,450
however there are certain limitations

141
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:21,930
when it comes to sending the data from

142
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,190
our platform victim is our outgoing feed

143
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,600
at the moment does not support these

144
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:31,440
galaxies or complex mismatch readers so

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,080
while you can ingest reports and TTP's

146
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,180
and tractors you still cannot send them

147
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,630
back from our platform we're working on

148
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,910
that part we also don't support deletion

149
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,320
of and it is

150
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,320
we also what you've added party no yet

151
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:52,530
later and there is one small particular

152
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:54,450
thing with the current integration every

153
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,710
event that comes from our platform has

154
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,229
an additional text attribute the causes

155
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,950
small piece of metadata which helps us

156
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,810
track event version so if you connect

157
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,400
one miss instance and another missed

158
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:12,030
instance we still know that is the same

159
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:17,909
event and it actually targets the same

160
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:20,099
end and now let me give you a small

161
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:26,730
round of most common use case that we

162
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:29,360
see our customers so one of the the main

163
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:33,090
use case we see our customers having is

164
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,340
taking incoming miss taper pushing that

165
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,350
to the a classic ru platform enriching

166
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,330
it using our knowledge base and then

167
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,600
pushing a back to miss and then they can

168
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:48,230
share this with the wider miss community

169
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:51,030
so outside start so imagine an a-list

170
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,090
has just received an ongoing an incident

171
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,980
from one of his miss feeds and this is

172
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,220
kind of what it looks like

173
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,680
they then decide they want to search for

174
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,300
related set intelligence so they look

175
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,640
within their miss knowledge base and

176
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,770
they can't find anything so they decided

177
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:13,620
to pull it into the collective IQ

178
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:15,660
platform and see what they can find and

179
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,420
then this is what that incident will

180
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,400
look like so the event will be

181
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,550
represented as an incident object

182
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,319
you've got the atributes as indicators

183
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,780
or a report depending on the attribute

184
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,290
type and then you have the galaxies I

185
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:36,780
represent as a fraternity and TTP

186
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:40,140
entities so this allies decided to set

187
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,930
up automated written rules so if we look

188
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,370
at the top the indicator extract would

189
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,390
be enriched straight away what's he's

190
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,590
ingested this will create an indicator

191
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:57,270
and in this case we found a related hash

192
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:59,910
and what they do they decide to share

193
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,160
thank you they decide to pivot off the

194
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,530
rated hash and they find an existing

195
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:10,800
hash we're in the tip next slide please

196
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:13,920
thank you all right so now they find

197
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,589
they pivot off the existing hash they

198
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,709
find a malware TTP and then this malware

199
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,130
TTP has already has related intelligence

200
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,260
to it so what they do they just like to

201
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:27,780
relate this intelligence back to the

202
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,750
listening event which so that thing can

203
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,089
push back to mess it's like thank you

204
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,830
and then this is what it would look like

205
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,700
a mess and as you can see the

206
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:42,990
highlighted these are the new indicators

207
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:46,920
in the event yep and we see this as a

208
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:49,530
repeatable process so as incoming data

209
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,110
comes into Miss they men just they can

210
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,400
then decide to push it into our platform

211
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,839
push back out some to miss and then

212
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,140
share it with whoever the other

213
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,030
communities they want cool

214
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,210
I just put over to Alex he'll tell you

215
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,630
the future integration and hopefully

216
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:09,330
some stuff we may support in the future

217
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:12,060
so as I mentioned earlier

218
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,070
we are planning to add entity deletion

219
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,890
to our system using the sub delete

220
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,990
feature we are heavily investigating

221
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,330
support for custom taxonomies to allow

222
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,490
our customers to actually set up their

223
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,130
own mappings their own taxonomies

224
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:29,810
however they like to set up their

225
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,770
workflow we are definitely adding more

226
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:34,319
attribute types support for more

227
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,689
attribute types and trying to expand the

228
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,020
support for music galaxies we want to

229
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:42,600
improve the outgoing feed so it has the

230
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,670
feature parity Viteri are incomplete so

231
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,590
you know there's not this oh you can eat

232
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,439
you can adjust a tractor but you can't

233
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,140
send it and we are also working with

234
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,790
updating the configuration process so we

235
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,680
instead of setting the incoming field

236
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,510
and the outgoing field there's a

237
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,390
possibility of human error when you when

238
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:03,240
you set everything up how things should

239
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:05,160
work we want to track like actually and

240
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,750
it is that came directly in the incoming

241
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,790
field without you having to create the

242
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,240
data set everything connects

243
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:16,500
automatically that's all and that's

244
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,900
pretty much it if you want to see more

245
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,970
about this integration you can check the

246
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,699
link above or you can check our other

247
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,339
integrations that it can be inserted

248
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,250
from on our platform you can see our

249
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,170
open source projects on github one of

250
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,470
them is open taxied it is already being

251
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:44,520
used by ms and you have some questions

252
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:46,800
yes so one of the things that comes up

253
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,079
very often is the question is what other

254
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,579
tools to integrate with anteye and how

255
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,350
good is the integration so one of the

256
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,750
things that i'm wondering is do you have

257
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,580
an exhaustive list of how you've mapped

258
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,570
each individual data point between the

259
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,620
two tools to be very interesting for us

260
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,020
we are actually building at the moment

261
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,880
our integrations catalog we don't have

262
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,829
it together to that level we have a list

263
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,150
of all the integrations we support we

264
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,520
are actively working on our

265
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:15,000
documentation but we cannot promise that

266
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,250
the dates but we want that if nothing

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,290
else does the mappings so that analysts

268
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,810
can know what to expect when they oh I

269
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,899
won't use this this integrations let me

270
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:35,290
see what

271
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:36,850
do I get anyone oh thank you and to my

272
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,949
understanding eclectic also allows you

273
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,899
to share fur with with different people

274
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:43,649
in your eclectic community or trust

275
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:43,649
communities that's correct

276
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:53,559
[Music]

277
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:55,209
okay okay then I misunderstood before

278
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,889
because I had a question in relation to

279
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:00,638
distribution how it went but it's not

280
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:03,999
relevant service you can connect

281
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,220
multiple instances or instances and

282
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:09,699
share between them but it's up on all

283
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:13,059
our customers to set up what you can do

284
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:15,219
is put data from these into our platform

285
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:17,649
then to send it to another missed

286
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,809
incident one who our platform this is

287
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:28,209
the tracking had to go different

288
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:30,279
measures um just a stupid question I

289
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:35,979
know I was renting a little bit earlier

290
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:40,290
about XML and six-one but I I do know

291
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,879
that you guys support sticks one and

292
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:46,689
like I think sticks compliant was on

293
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:49,360
your first slide and and I have on a

294
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:54,639
number of occasions successfully

295
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,490
exported an event from this and imported

296
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,259
it into like taken a Cuban and vice

297
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,600
versa I'm I'm wondering have you

298
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,910
considered instead of doing and eat an

299
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,569
ETL and a data mapping between internal

300
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:11,019
data models possibly using sticks as an

301
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:16,059
interchange format which might save a

302
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:20,249
bit of work yes but I think that our

303
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:23,019
first integration it be actual events

304
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:25,149
that was before I joined eclectic ago so

305
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:28,449
I don't really have for historical

306
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:34,110
knowledge I think that our customers

307
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:36,270
complained on the way how how its how

308
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,090
the events are exported like in six

309
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,939
format for me versus how we expect them

310
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,160
in the air but maybe Steve's tubules

311
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:48,410
will solve that we haven't still try to

312
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,410
be working on adding support for sister

313
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:57,240
unfortunately multiple clients expect

314
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,540
different not be even in the sticks the

315
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,520
ideal world yeah we don't use platform

316
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:17,130
at one transport and everything will be

317
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:17,960
fine you know well oh I not sure I think

318
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:22,430
it's on

319
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:26,760
we provide integrations based on

320
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:29,339
customer contract basis so I give this I

321
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,560
like this everybody can get it it's

322
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:38,610
available but I don't know the sales

323
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:40,500
follow I'm a lowly software guy yes we

324
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,260
at the moment takes put him pretty much

325
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,110
like like events like incident it is

326
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,569
connected to an incident that also has

327
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:52,110
also spreads like like like experience

328
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:55,380
we are also I forgot to edit show you I

329
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,480
want to add more support for it so we we

330
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,090
can actually update them but it's like

331
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,330
still this you have a one governing

332
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:09,540
entity and you have the indicator

333
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:11,790
observable yes quick on that trigger

334
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,500
this is I don't know you guys are

335
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,760
different on during the week maybe if

336
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,560
you have time we could sit down and

337
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:27,750
actually time that little bit ahead and

338
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:31,139
just to see how we can map it once so

339
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,840
kind of connect over some what subgroups

340
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,850
are and things of that nature and that

341
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,100
was handed over to our marketing

342
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,409
department it was a poor partnership

343
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,360
management department and that I think

344
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:46,380
I'd diode died off but I would be very
