1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,610
all right good morning everybody I'm

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,399
pleased to be here it's my first missed

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:15,160
workshop and I've been working with the

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
core team and a few ideas and I'd like

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,580
to share with you those ideas so it's

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,169
not from me - you also want to hear your

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,359
your feedback so I'm gonna have a few

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,390
questions for you so we can just chat

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,000
about it I'm gonna talk about sightings

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,310
so you bought me some special trick out

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,340
I've been developing a lot of different

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:37,239
tools I work for a community called Evo

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,129
we do data engineering data management

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,930
I'm also the lead developer of a tool

15
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:44,230
called hope I'm giving a workshop for a

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:46,960
hack school in two days and also work on

17
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,459
various other open source projects so

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
I've been doing this presentation

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,489
listening to Professor Longhair if you

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,859
haven't heard of him he's just amazing

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,699
so what is citing I'm sure everybody has

22
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:03,280
seen this in the indie UI so it's

23
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:05,110
basically when you have an event and you

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,619
want to know that you've seen this event

25
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,869
so you can click here on the firm web

26
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:13,600
say yeah I've seen this it looks good or

27
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:16,979
but nope looks bad false positive and

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,979
you can configure a bunch of stuff so

29
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,770
first of all how many of you are using

30
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:25,509
sightings all right that's not a lot

31
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,280
it's less than a third actually it's

32
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:31,360
maybe a fourth or a fifth of the

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,399
audience so it's it's good to know among

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,799
those that are using sightings are using

35
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,530
the sighting time Drive feature which is

36
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,290
just to see how many things on time are

37
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:47,530
useful all right everybody works for a

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:50,200
circle interesting and if I am much

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,719
faster of dealing with sighting if I

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,790
remove the the graph feature because it

41
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,890
can have an impact do you think it's

42
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,750
it's okay or would you disagree with

43
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,329
this then we can debate and an RPG

44
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:06,899
debate about this who think it's okay

45
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,898
all right thanks

46
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,230
okay you want to get the latest but you

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,580
don't necessarily need to know in the

48
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,709
last because I have to store everything

49
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,170
like a and I would be much much much

50
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,180
faster if I just order the first and

51
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,458
latest you want to know the first of

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,989
course that that makes sense but I was

53
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,790
wondering if you want something in

54
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,790
between like how many I had last week

55
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,750
mm-hmm okay no that's that's good to

56
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,940
know like all right that's that's

57
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,860
something to consider and maybe we can

58
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,079
have the option and see how many and are

59
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,940
using and you have you are where more

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,349
than everybody here on the details of

61
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,340
the use cases so I'm really interested

62
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:06,560
to hear that and last question

63
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,170
who needs a CL on top of sighting it's a

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,239
serious question like are you okay to

65
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,179
share to another organization that you

66
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:18,290
have seen this host or this IP address

67
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:25,670
like who is against or who is for raise

68
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:27,980
your hand if you're against yeah okay

69
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,359
all right know that again that's that's

70
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,250
good to know that's exactly what I want

71
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,280
to hear I want to get an idea of where I

72
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,230
need to start in order to just keep this

73
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,030
project moving faster and have some

74
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,260
arguments now I can tell the guys you

75
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,079
see in the audience on you want for

76
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,048
visiting sightings so no thank you all

77
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,790
right let's keep moving

78
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:49,190
so we're gonna look from a magical point

79
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,380
of view the storage of of sightings so

80
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,930
basically this is a there is a sighting

81
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,680
stable here and in that case I'm looking

82
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,030
at all even ID 2607 and all the signing

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,120
for that even ID so you have different

84
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,100
sightings here and you have you have the

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,799
organization you have everything so one

86
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,720
line is one sighting so that's how the

87
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,870
graph is the image is just by looking at

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:17,570
the single event and the the even ID and

89
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,160
just a graph over time so we if we get

90
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,380
our attribute start inciting with just

91
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,090
yet all right select from that attribute

92
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,460
watch the ID is the one that you saw

93
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,460
before in the signing table that's one

94
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,070
event and if we stall one attribute

95
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,450
twice is gonna make 22 lines and if we

96
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,340
store three attributes is going to be

97
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,190
stored three times so then that's how

98
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,690
the graph can be made just simple I just

99
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,180
wanted everybody to mean same page here

100
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,039
so this is the sequence storage of

101
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,870
sightings so there's a bunch of things

102
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,960
here the ided at Riptide even ID

103
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:51,380
organization ID the date of deciding the

104
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,940
UUID the source and the type the type is

105
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,750
something that's very specific to how

106
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,380
miss

107
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,710
Cesar sighting and what I did is I wrote

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,750
a demon I am like okay I haven't written

109
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,090
database in my life I missed something

110
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,100
so how about I write a database and if I

111
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,989
have to I want to learn in language and

112
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,360
which language rest alright let's do it

113
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,870
in rest so basically this is the rest

114
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,850
structure of the siding and I try to be

115
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,670
as minimalistic as I could be where I

116
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,770
only store the value which is a string

117
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,510
the first time we've seen it the last

118
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,280
time we've seen it the source that we

119
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,060
can define and the source timestamp come

120
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,940
back and say all right

121
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,250
Hana I don't know what type of styling

122
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,380
this is but now I know that oh it's from

123
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,820
honeypot and I learned that a few days

124
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,409
later so maybe it's interesting to know

125
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,290
the source at some point and I want to

126
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,390
know when I learned about the source it

127
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,090
may not be in the beginning and of

128
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,950
course how many times I've seen this so

129
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:51,109
the philosophy behind second DB is just

130
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,599
just sightings it just signs from is no

131
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,220
more or less than that I just want to do

132
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,540
signings I don't want to do a generic

133
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,780
database I don't want to do anything

134
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,630
that's like over complicated I just want

135
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,890
to do science for me I was very inspired

136
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:10,340
from zookeeper zookeeper is is a way to

137
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:12,169
it's in the Hadoop ecosystem and some

138
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,820
people say it's an algorithm for a

139
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:16,580
synchronization to know where you go to

140
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,169
your database and when but the way I see

141
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,419
zookeeper is also has a key be store

142
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,799
where you can store it configurations

143
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,690
and you can say all right Dukey easy

144
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,930
path and then you just work with a path

145
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,630
which I found very very convenient and

146
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,580
also I wanted to make HTTP harder to

147
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:36,020
configure than HTTP which means by

148
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,460
default I give a shrimp certificate that

149
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,680
everybody has access to the private key

150
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,870
it's just a sub sign but I'm like okay

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,880
you can change that and you can use this

152
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,370
one it's actually no worse than having a

153
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,750
clear text being sent over the wire so

154
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,760
I'm like okay that's fine it's just

155
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,490
harder to configure HTTP for that

156
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,039
purpose so I'll give you an example of

157
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,840
the name spacing inside in DB so the

158
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,780
name spacing is just as you can see here

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,810
the path where you have in that case the

160
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,299
UUID and the variable host

161
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,750
so that's your key so the key can be

162
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,610
defined in the way you

163
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,550
in that case I say alright I want to get

164
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,390
the you idea of the organization and and

165
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,530
the name of the variable or I can't do

166
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,110
all right I want to get all the hosts

167
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,640
and I'm just doing all host and this way

168
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,380
I can start also all the hosts

169
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,810
regardless of the you idea of the

170
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,610
organization all right and you all and

171
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,920
also add the type here because as

172
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,290
remember in the Miss single database

173
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,050
there was the type so we could agree on

174
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,800
a structure but at least this is not the

175
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,720
database job to do that just above and

176
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,020
we just store all those signatures into

177
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,700
this into this key so the thing is

178
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,500
there's a lack of space for the

179
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,780
namespace which is on purpose we could

180
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,310
refine this in this if you want to but

181
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,109
at least from the database point of view

182
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,380
I just want the database to be very very

183
00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:00,270
done and just all what being told to to

184
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:02,580
store so as for the value there is a

185
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,520
REST API that allows you to written

186
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:09,990
right on site in DB so the value is sent

187
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,760
in base64 URL and no padding and we can

188
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,290
offer many more ways in the future but

189
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,930
for now that's what works in the

190
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,570
database and we provide a tool called

191
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,490
b64 that just going to encode this way

192
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,040
so then you can just give in to the URL

193
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,050
this for example I want to store miss as

194
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,510
the value and it's likely going to

195
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,669
translate into this base64 URL no

196
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,669
padding so let's do a demo

197
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,450
so here I'm starting the demon so there

198
00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:00,570
is just a simple configuration file let

199
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:04,580
me show you that first so you just tell

200
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,870
listen port so I took 9999 cuz the MIS

201
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,589
modules were in sick sick sick sick so

202
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:13,560
you know I didn't have any idea so in

203
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,180
that case I don't demonize and I just

204
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,130
have a DVD which is where I'm storing

205
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,459
the data on disk if I want start things

206
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,370
on disk the log level and SSL configured

207
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:27,260
by true a by default with those we can

208
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,260
public private and public keys

209
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:54,189
and now I'm just ring going to run Carol

210
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:57,399
on the on the database so what i'm doing

211
00:09:54,189 --> 00:10:03,539
here is i'm just doing a rest api call

212
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:07,419
where i am writing here and I used the

213
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:09,399
w-4 right and this is an m-space full

214
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:11,348
slash bar is the namespace and this is

215
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:24,009
my value here so I'm just going to start

216
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:26,979
the value so I get okay as that's fine

217
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:30,429
so I'm doing that four times and now I'm

218
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:32,919
doing another another event hello

219
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:35,139
so how to read I just changed here from

220
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,819
W to R and I just keep the rest cause

221
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:40,479
I'm reading from that next place in that

222
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:48,579
value so when I read let me do it like

223
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:49,779
this so what Emery when I read I'm

224
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:51,579
getting all the things you've seen in

225
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,139
structure where the values hello the

226
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:55,569
first time I've seen is that time the

227
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:57,220
last time I've seen is that time the

228
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:57,789
source and actually I've seen it only

229
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,329
once

230
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:03,220
now if I do it with miss foo you will

231
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,679
see that it's going to be like three a

232
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,850
count of three and it's gonna be

233
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,850
different from the first time the last

234
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,909
time I've seen it so there was just a

235
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,259
few seconds of Delta five seconds the

236
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,720
source is unknown because I haven't said

237
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:24,579
it and this is the sauce timestamp and I

238
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:29,559
have a count for all right the my

239
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:33,339
networks so how much time you have three

240
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:36,488
minutes five okay so things that sang in

241
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:39,939
DB does I leverage rest so it's all

242
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:41,529
virgin rest I can do multiple writes

243
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,179
without being a term each I don't care

244
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:44,859
cuz I in the end in the database I'm

245
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:47,709
just adding the sum of what the things

246
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:49,479
I'm having because I'm just counting so

247
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:52,689
if I was doing other things in Compton

248
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:54,069
if I was like for example writing some

249
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:55,748
values that would may have to have a

250
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:57,819
delta or D for something or we're

251
00:11:55,749 --> 00:12:00,220
merging but in my case it just counting

252
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:02,189
so I can just do a simple add to all the

253
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,089
other values are written at same time

254
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:06,879
I'm using

255
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,410
hashmap for now to start the namespace

256
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,649
so I could change it in the future but

257
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,139
for now it's working keys can be

258
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:16,240
configured to be all in memory or on the

259
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:20,139
on disk or both depending on what you

260
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,149
want to do and attributes are being read

261
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:26,439
automatically thanks to surgery which is

262
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:29,259
a rest sterilization of library so

263
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:30,879
integration plan so my idea for

264
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,100
integrating this into Miss is the

265
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,699
following and again my idea I'm very

266
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,740
open to your way of thinking so we

267
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:40,839
should keep the magical way and add 2nd

268
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,129
EB as an installation dependency just

269
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,050
add it then we have import/export with

270
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:51,279
my sequence adding to cycling dB

271
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,258
so we can go in both ways then we have

272
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,300
sign in DB side by side with Mexico so

273
00:12:53,259 --> 00:13:01,050
we store it in both we store in the

274
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,050
Mexico and inside DB then we can replace

275
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,589
then we can replace the IPA DDA pi2

276
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:15,189
siding DB feature by feature so we don't

277
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:19,449
break the Mexico and once complete we

278
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:20,980
can remove the magical table so the

279
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:23,889
benefit is we can reduce the storage

280
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,050
size it's designed for misfits serving

281
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:30,970
this the best we can and we can do

282
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:33,279
concurrent reading rights so this is

283
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,649
where you can download it so please

284
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,110
download that test up in tickets

285
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:41,439
whatever you know I'm listening to use

286
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,179
cases you have and at the same time also

287
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,920
wrote a small thing to test and debug I

288
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:47,379
want to see the material queries being

289
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,399
done in real time so I wrote a Mexico

290
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:55,059
query sniffer in C with the peak app and

291
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,129
I have Luigi's interpreter that gets all

292
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:59,350
the magical queries so I can do I can

293
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:02,860
use Lua to do other things so then I was

294
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:06,370
just creating CSV is everyday of all the

295
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,050
data coming to miss and and you know I

296
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,519
just wrote that for testing and I just

297
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,139
released this because it's cool and

298
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,929
maybe you can enjoy it for other

299
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:16,240
purposes

300
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:17,410
so with the Miss spirit

301
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,850
Miss B is right

302
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,319
the code and doing a spec yeah and I

303
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,569
thought it was nice to also write a spec

304
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:25,180
just to agree on the things so there is

305
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:27,579
a spec here that you can look at and

306
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,069
send your PRS up in issues and talk

307
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:34,628
about whatever you need all right I'm

308
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:37,209
done yes so first of all thanks I mean

309
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:39,579
it's really great stuff and going back

310
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,779
to one of the things that you raised in

311
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,758
the beginning with those questions I

312
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,470
think the answer to most of those

313
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,209
questions is both depending on the user

314
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,920
you asked so we had some discussions

315
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:49,779
recently about exactly those questions

316
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,089
and we have some users that really want

317
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,769
to do both sightings and some users that

318
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,480
are just doing reporting for example

319
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,100
where they need more accuracy on who

320
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,170
they share with and so on so indeed the

321
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,730
mix model sounds best but instead

322
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,378
perhaps thinking of copying the data

323
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,149
between the two we should consider two

324
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:06,069
systems that were both at the same time

325
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,889
with this that would take a lot of

326
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:11,829
restrictions of your back basically but

327
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:13,240
it would allow us to still maintain what

328
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,859
we have currently for those users that

329
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,110
do the reporting and for example for us

330
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,220
that want to do the massive amount so

331
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,810
one of the things were that would be

332
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,490
interesting and what I'm curious what

333
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:27,430
your view is what are we missing to be

334
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,990
able to on demand convert between one of

335
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:32,258
these systems to the other are we

336
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,389
missing anything on the existing side to

337
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:38,620
do that for example get this summary of

338
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:41,319
the data out in one shot yes so

339
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,660
basically I think I agree we should do

340
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,910
both because we can do and we're also

341
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,850
learning like it's nobody's doing that

342
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:52,089
today like nobody is doing even outside

343
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,220
of miss a scary scary beware to sight

344
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,949
and to see everything and we also know

345
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,449
that signing is just beyond indicators

346
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:01,449
it's not just about the indicators it's

347
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:05,050
also like everything you're saying so we

348
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:07,649
don't know and I think there is nothing

349
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,149
I'm missing today in how miss B's design

350
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:12,130
in order to do that the only thing I can

351
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,019
add just another rest call at the time

352
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,959
where you just tore into the siding to

353
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:18,970
sign in DB and that's how it could start

354
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,500
and it could be I think it should be an

355
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,839
optional thing in the very beginning

356
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,939
like it does not matter except for those

357
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,439
it matters and then we can learn on who

358
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:26,920
is using that really and how we can

359
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,660
tailor

360
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,009
if you were doing something that

361
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,650
everybody knew already in the past we

362
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:32,300
have

363
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,459
it's easy the answer is that oh yeah

364
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,500
sure this is how it's done in just but

365
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,510
we also need to learn ourselves so I

366
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,060
think it's best to say all right it's an

367
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,640
optional dependency and then it's a side

368
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,930
by side dependency and then who knows it

369
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,400
doesn't matter if we can see the story

370
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,229
my sickle because it's working for some

371
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,730
users I mean why stop that because we

372
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:54,790
want to stop that for no good reason

373
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:59,180
right I mean that's I see it Thanks

374
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,990
any other question all right well thank

375
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,829
you

376
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,829
[Applause]
