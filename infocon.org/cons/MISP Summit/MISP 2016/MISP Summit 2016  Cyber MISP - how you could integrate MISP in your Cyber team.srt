1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,650
I just wanted to use cyber with my title

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:13,230
first off my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex adiga I work</font>

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,680
as an instant responder for years<font color="#CCCCCC"> f</font>

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:22,619
however I'm not representing BSF so I'm

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:28,080
here on my own just<font color="#CCCCCC"> presenting my ideas</font>

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:31,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">and stuff I came up with from working</font>

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,430
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> first so first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a form of instant</font>

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,120
response teams so let's see all right

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:43,200
let's give some disclaimers some things

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned our only IDs some things can</font>

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,180
be easily implemented using the API some

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,000
things are already available and park

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,400
from are already available and of course

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost everything can be done with</font>

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:01,640
another tool can be done in a better way

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:10,560
with other tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't care i just did</font>

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:13,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok that's um so far to be peaceful so</font>

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,799
let's see how how miss work in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font>

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:22,590
it was good for exchanging<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc's for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mel</font>

20
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">there it was good for person-to-person</font>

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,399
communication and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think two or three</font>

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago started to work between</font>

23
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:36,179
organizations as well pretty good but if

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,689
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> an individual trying to put all</font>

25
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:44,219
your stuff into<font color="#CCCCCC"> here miss um that might</font>

26
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,408
not scale so you don't want to add stuff

27
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:50,100
manually because you might end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

28
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:53,700
Lisa sitting front of her books and if

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,359
you do so for half a year you might end

30
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:03,389
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and you don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

31
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:07,380
that so what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goal</font>

32
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:11,579
for for me for you guys is to speed up

33
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:15,060
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> in response process reduce stupid</font>

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,060
and boring work steps so that people in

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,670
your SOC will

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,849
quit their jobs because they do monkey

37
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,549
work and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to work in a</font>

38
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:26,488
team so you want to leverage stuff that

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:35,769
others in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> team or in other</font>

40
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:39,640
organizations do so you want this so how

41
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:41,110
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miss in your cyber key let's</font>

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,890
assume you have of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

43
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:47,890
persons working on the same case event

44
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:51,750
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the hurdle of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> handover</font>

45
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:56,319
we need to ensure stuff is documented

46
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:59,680
you want to auto enrich data I think

47
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:04,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">aleksandra talked about it this before a</font>

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:07,540
little bit in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> case um I use active</font>

49
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:10,420
directory as an example and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:15,069
automatically add events to your miss

51
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:19,000
princes and you of course only want to

52
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:24,488
focus on on how critical stuff we want

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be like these geniuses so let's see</font>

54
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:32,049
the example of the active<font color="#E5E5E5"> directory what</font>

55
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,390
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the benefits are you can have</font>

56
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:36,700
correlations between machines you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

57
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,450
see this machine was infected a year ago

58
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:43,810
already you can have correlations on

59
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:47,679
user base so user a is<font color="#E5E5E5"> using different</font>

60
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines you can identify high critical</font>

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,670
systems if that data is of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail</font>

62
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Active Directory and you can use</font>

63
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,858
for example text based on the location

64
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:02,100
of your system to get trends in what

65
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:05,769
area of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment you have more</font>

66
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,019
infections that can be easily done using

67
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:13,480
a simple Python script so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

68
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:16,930
acted in about four or five hours just

69
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,969
adding new attributes to event based on

70
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:25,630
a horse thing and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really adds value</font>

71
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,159
but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course it limits you based on</font>

72
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,070
data you have in your Active Directory

73
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:32,140
so shitting shit out

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,159
but if you have the data available it

75
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:39,940
can help your<font color="#CCCCCC"> young miss beta</font>

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:46,320
dramatically so that's me creating

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:51,370
that's good um another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example um I</font>

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,670
created I think half year ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> um is an</font>

79
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,760
integration with Miss with fire I sorry

80
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,760
so fire I has several sensors which

81
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:04,150
enables you to detect stuff in your

82
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,580
network or in your parameter what I

83
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:10,599
wanted to achieve is I want to have her

84
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:14,140
fire I event one missed payment stuff

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,960
that you can extract from these events

86
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:22,150
is for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> through as a destination</font>

87
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:25,419
IP destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> poured SI toos you can</font>

88
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,359
get meta bear names and this tool is

89
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:31,510
available already on github so you just

90
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">redirect your fire I appliance to push</font>

91
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:37,900
all the events to map server and the web

92
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,960
server takes all the events and adds it

93
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:46,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this avi to miss arm but the new</font>

94
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,520
version will come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think next week I</font>

95
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:53,590
would do as a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than at the</font>

96
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,490
moment to a lot of correlation stuff um

97
00:05:53,590 --> 00:06:02,859
to deduplicate but it already works in

98
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:04,870
production and it's good thing on but be

99
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,720
careful if you do that you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up</font>

100
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:13,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">with maybe thousands events so be sure</font>

101
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:20,460
you have enough people to follow up on

102
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:24,100
that side and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now how can we use miss in</font>

103
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:27,909
your silo<font color="#E5E5E5"> team so let's assume your</font>

104
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:32,380
cyber defense organization has of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

105
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:35,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">tr.0 or a medic stuff you have some kind</font>

106
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:38,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of soc which is outsourced for the real</font>

107
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,720
low hanging fruits you have internal

108
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,200
sock analysts and you're in series

109
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,200

110
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:55,360

111
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:58,239
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero you could add stuff like which</font>

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,720
host is affected what is location of the

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,420
system you can add stuff like the metal

<font color="#CCCCCC">barriers used the known bad destination</font>

115
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:11,050
and also threat rating based on sensors

116
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:13,210
so most sensors would<font color="#CCCCCC"> review</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

117
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,180
how critical something is so if the

<font color="#E5E5E5">member name contains</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apt you might want</font>

120
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,360
already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good basic set of</font>

121
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,210
information then next what can your

tears you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tier want to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arm they</font>

123
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,549
didn't check if it's false positive so

124
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,040
if there is AP 8888 in there might be

125
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:39,760
false positive or check the warning user

126
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:44,080
fees against the information provided by

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,510
your automated stuff they could also

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,780
start triaging<font color="#CCCCCC"> inform other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> samples</font>

response tool on your end points and

132
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,690
last but not least is they can use

133
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,880
templates um it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small feature</font>

134
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,670
but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it it's very powerful</font>

135
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,210
because using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the templates you can</font>

force your<font color="#E5E5E5"> SOC or whatever whoever's</font>

working on it to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information</font>

138
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,450
you expect from them for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they</font>

139
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,159
start working on something they need to

00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:25,210
provide a case number in your ticketing

141

need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide certain tags they need</font>

143
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,549
to provide the analyst named kind of

144
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,630
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so use templates to force people</font>

145
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,968
providing the information do you expect

easier in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the latest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> date of your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">insolence process your internal SOC</font>

149
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,420
could then correlate that stuff of other

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,240
events<font color="#E5E5E5"> so have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you seen that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

151
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">hasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been analyzed already then you</font>

152
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,160
might just drop

153
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,470
they can add business context saying

154
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,480
okay this is high critical system or I

155
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,140
know this is board member<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

156
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,840
organization and then increase or

157
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,780
decrease<font color="#E5E5E5"> the priority and of course</font>

158
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,900
adding text so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> holes of</font>

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">fishing cage it has been blocked it has</font>

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:23,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">been detected by system equalizer so</font>

161
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:28,150
just enrich the data you have already in

162
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:31,990
place and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course upload samples to</font>

163
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:35,110
send box like who or other software in

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">your organization and adding these</font>

165
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,150
results in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your music again so for</font>

166
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:47,140
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> samples might reveal another sea</font>

167
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:48,400
to address or stuff set box reveals if

you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of information</font>

169
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,980
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> in hand it's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool to then</font>

170
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,350
start your real incident response

171
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,970
process because you don't start from

172
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:03,340
zero have already a good the kind of

173
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,670
information available you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

174
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:12,040
start with manual investigation you can

175
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:14,530
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc's um because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other areas</font>

176
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:19,390
might not be empowered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font>

177
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:21,550
information you can also do reverse

178
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:27,640
engineering when you reverse engineering

179
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:30,609
on samples post modern forensics and one

180
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,300
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I discovered in the last</font>

181
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:38,470
few and the same weeks is if strategic

182
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,290
advice because if you have a good amount

183
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,630
of events in your miss that has text

184
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,120
that has locations you could for example

185
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:50,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">gift advice Kate we have seen an</font>

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,410
country we might spend some money on

188
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">awareness in that specific country or</font>

189
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can identify users we need special</font>

190
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:07,510
training these kind of strategic advices

191
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:10,620
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> are then low-hanging fruit because</font>

192
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the data available</font>

193
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:17,680
and if you do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff</font>

194
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:22,709
because will love you excellent because

195
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are all low hanging fruit</font>

196
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:29,889
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um if you if you consider</font>

197
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,579
yourself an analyst what is the most

198
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:37,449
used tool for you it's the browser we

199
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:39,339
have openly<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost the entire day um so</font>

200
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:43,240
I thought it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very nice to</font>

201
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:46,870
have a browser<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin for this so that</font>

202
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,300
you just can do right-click and search a

203
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:53,709
Miss and just make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> red or yellow if</font>

204
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:56,109
you have that information or not I think

205
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:59,829
would help a lot and shouldn't be that

206
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:08,440
hard to to implement so even March can

207
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:10,810
do it so having said that um thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

prescriptive to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> integrated in the</font>

212
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:28,410
workflow of your cyber defense strategy

213
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,670
thank you very much
