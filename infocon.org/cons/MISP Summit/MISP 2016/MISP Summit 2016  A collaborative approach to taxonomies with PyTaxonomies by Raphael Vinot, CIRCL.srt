1
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:14,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so as we were talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier</font>

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:18,410
we so we have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the titles taxonomies</font>

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,960
that are listed in JSON files and used

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,448
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss but they can also be using other</font>

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,509
tools right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the way they look like</font>

6
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:29,839
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a JSON file similar to</font>

7
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:33,260
that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is easier as I'm dealing with</font>

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,390
XML documents but it's still like

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,050
editing your txt file which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which can</font>

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,940
sometimes be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an asset so an to</font>

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,129
just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it and find out what</font>

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,108
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> txt file is already here and what</font>

13
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:47,570
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of content do you have a son it's</font>

14
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:50,210
not necessarily super easy like you may

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,180
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a way to just go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through it</font>

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,920
without without having to look at the

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,620
adult Python utter at some text file and

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,620
searching detail and so on so what I

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,570
develop to just have a nice interface to

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,980
dig into all those types enemies is a

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,869
small website that horns like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,210
it's just a flat website you can just

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,060
honk locally on your machine it pops

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,729
already seen taxonomies and this big

25
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">displays</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm in an interface so you can</font>

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:26,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just click on an untaxed on me</font>

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,490
and see the content of it and if you go

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,170
like if you go for some legal ones like

29
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you can just see all those</font>

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:37,700
indications right away without having to

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:42,649
dig into a text file which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah</font>

32
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure so and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that it's going to</font>

33
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:48,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on you see at the end of</font>

34
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,120
the line here machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> tags which is the</font>

35
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,399
same thing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> what on of us was showing</font>

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,470
earlier so you have all those

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,290
information directly like in in your web

38
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,000
browser aren't you can basically you can

39
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,830
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through it like you can self you have</font>

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,920
a really easy search interface here so

41
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:08,959
if i look for falling apart for CIT i'm

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,788
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheapy taxonomy they look</font>

43
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,219
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you oh I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to just find like</font>

44
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,859

45
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,600
to just find out some

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,290
on the text enemies you have in your

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,880
interface and you have some more

48
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,760
information like the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of entries</font>

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,250
you having each taxonomy and so on until

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,320
if you click on it you see all those

51
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,070
informations you see the version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

52
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">taxonomy and yet so you can even delete</font>

53
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">just go through that fairly easily and</font>

54
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,910
the other interesting personality that

55
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,459
you can do search so if finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> search for Hong somewhere I everyone</font>

57

61
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,870
which I have a one somewhere example

62
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,209
Enys I are the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moroi classification</font>

63
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,220
I have the same very same so I can it's

64
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy when you have one of those machine</font>

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">type one of those tax somewhere in your</font>

66
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,250
misfeasance you will be able really

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily on liking it in a few in a few</font>

68
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,760
weeks to just tried out all the other

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,500
similar tags you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add in the</font>

70
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,359
event outlet because now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot</font>

71
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,519
of tags not this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one taxonomy so it's</font>

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,030
really easy to really useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just</font>

73
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,420
find a way to get to map tax all UMI's

74
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,970
with each other but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose if web</font>

75
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,429
interface I had to develop a python

76
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,910
module that's going to load all your

77
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,680
JSON documents into a Python dictionary

78
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,870
art I'm going to show you how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,220
because it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool if you</font>

80
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:49,120
actually want to do to ADT taxonomy live

81
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:52,060
or if you want to set you all so you

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,769
just do you load your text me so you you

83
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,150
importer the class here and then so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

84
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,470
impulse<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent those funds having to</font>

85
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,420
be the nerdy directly from the internet

86
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,030
aren't loaded luckily you can also load

87
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,500
a manifest file this is no computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

88
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to just do it the default way</font>

89
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,140
from the internet then when it's done

90
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,690
you can get a text me 50 grand which

91
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">will get this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shaker texted me so as I</font>

92
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,048
mean if you wish you write in Python in

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,298
passing you recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's just</font>

94
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:24,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">like text view is that get as in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

95
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,299
dictionary and then if I do Clint

96
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,690
Prince you can I get all the texts

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">elimination take the pole section amis</font>

98
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:42,280
of all the author<font color="#CCCCCC"> tibbetts in text me if</font>

99
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:42,280
I want to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> well if I do see that</font>

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,740
that reason I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to dedicate a dump</font>

101
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,980
of all the attributes of the taxonomy

102
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,690
and what is really interesting when when

103
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,120
I do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that i can text box so I</font>

104
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,130
can get my text enemy directly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my in</font>

105
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,800
my come online on damp it as a JSON file

106
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,690
and import it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this directly so it's</font>

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,180
really it's really straightforward to

108
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,400
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own stuff on teach me to be</font>

109
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,590
very intimately like you have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

110
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason the text blimey this is</font>

111
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,020
dumped on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> substance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

112
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,520
work immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so you don't</font>

113
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,109
have to you don't have to mess around

114
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,030
trying out what is working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

115
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,160
touch me you can just you can just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

116
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,710
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would have really soon an</font>

117
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,390
interface like your luxury in the web

118
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,859
interface to do that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

119
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,630
right now so don't even try it's like

120
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,590
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail that it's going to</font>

121
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,150
look like that at some point you can

122
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,400
just catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all next on ax me save it</font>

123
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,780
and then upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss in the</font>

124
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,370
project or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it internally but</font>

125
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,719
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create your own</font>

126
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,910
without having to edit any text file and

127
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,440
some city also really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your bail</font>

128
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,620
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any system you want to</font>

129
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,010
change something in it so let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

130
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,500
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in the description sector</font>

131
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,430
that description<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as it's a fighting</font>

132
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:05,960
class really set for one if I change it

133
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:07,790
description equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> foo and then I do the</font>

134
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,560
design art I get description foo here

135
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:16,180
and then if i do try dump it as make

136
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,710
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON object i gets it as a text as</font>

137
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,360
violent as just the text object that you

138
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,150
can import in this directly so all that

139
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is implemented on just working on</font>

140
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,849
this way you make sure that you're like

141
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,230
zoom is are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working really cleanly and</font>

142

144
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,410
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should create it so you created here</font>

145
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,880
and then you hear the JSON file you put

146
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,770
it the directory on if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

147
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,389
tests are

148
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,599
the pie text miss module<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

149
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to load the JSON file on them it</font>

150
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,830
again which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eat compulsive</font>

158
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:10,330
enemies right now it's so it's available

159
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:13,150
in on eat up here as you can see code

160
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,389
coverage is very good and I had some fun

161
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,469
there so yeah I'm then if you just like

162
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at the code here it's going to</font>

163
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:23,409
just load all the events also<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

attributes of all the fridge<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

165
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,060
object I don't load it in you know

166
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,710
Python dictionary so you have all the

167
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,979
options of the passion passion Python

168
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,180
dictionary so you can do values keys so

169
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:44,800
if I look like that how you play

170
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:48,550
high-tech<font color="#CCCCCC"> tekzilla means that i will get</font>

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,159
all the keys so all the also name of

172
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:56,229
force of excellence aren't if I'd use em

173
00:07:51,159 --> 00:08:05,770
for values i get i get also text enemies

174
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:08,500
so if i do then that i will get so sort

175
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,180
of 0 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheer psu so it's just like you</font>

176
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,610
get this X enemy and you can just play

177
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,969
with it right away without having to

178
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,909
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with any JSON fight that's quite</font>

179
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:21,580
set for work and I had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same ID with</font>

180
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:23,919
Miss events because when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

181
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,810
missed event you also get a JSON file on

182
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,448
you may want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the same similar</font>

183

thing you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to open you of</font>

184
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,469

185
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,719
back or if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font>

186
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:39,550
everything you push back is a valid miss

187
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:42,099

really pathetic way like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you</font>

208
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,809
find really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you also make sure</font>

209
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:46,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that when you dump it so again if you do</font>

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that is going to dump you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ajisen</font>

211
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:55,740
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mood actual valid missed event</font>

212
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:58,410
you can import again in English so

213
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,399
that's and that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way</font>

214
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,709
that's something really wanted to

215
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,459
implement so full fool is going to just

216
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everything again Jason Jason the</font>

217
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,878
classic Jason them is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

218
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,219
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can upload on one of your</font>

219
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,629
instance because there is some some

220
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,399
particular fish you don't want to

221
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,290
reupload again if you should do some

222
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,000
edits in some fields you don't want to

223
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,509
get up close everything but yeah that's

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">a ID so you can you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all that by</font>

225
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:28,079
just using a completely normal Python

226
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:34,709
code without touching any kind of

227
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:36,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">chisholm any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cavities in files and again</font>

228
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:41,369
it's implemented in a really similar way

229
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:45,199
I load I love all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attributes present</font>

230
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:49,649
in the indecision in the JSON document

231
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:51,959
check on I in portage in a Python will

232
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,879
be spiteful object<font color="#CCCCCC"> find / when I ever</font>

233
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,768
even have a date I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be parted as</font>

234
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">dead time so this way you can actually</font>

235
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">compile events you can come back the</font>

236
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,209
debt of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> events using like</font>

237
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,650
comparing times in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> pies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is also</font>

238
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,829
really good

239
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,209
[Music]

240
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,890
do an idle imp it again I don't eat

241
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,440

242
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,300
out so that's fairly straightforward I

243
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,300
also load everything as in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tagore's when</font>

244
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:19,359
I can I'm dump it again back as as a

245
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,430
format<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquitted via by this so all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

246
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,310
stuff it's like it looks really big but

247
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:29,410
it's really just just a way to import

248
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,699
full JSON object in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bison class I'll</font>

249
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,569
do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like with it after a</font>

250
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:38,380
while and to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I dump</font>

251
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:41,410
I don't dump is natural valid JSON

252
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:46,350
object I use I use the schema provided

253
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:50,260
in enemies repository and compile it

254
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:54,360
when I don't you will get a warning if

255
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,770
it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a valid miss project</font>

256
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can also use miss objecting</font>

257
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,610
also tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> without any problem if you</font>

258
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,340
can just get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a missed object get all the</font>

259
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeds you want using pure python code</font>

260
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,650
without having to dig with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

261
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do whatever you like and yeah so</font>

262
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,189
that's at so really that's something I

263
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,630
really wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and it's like it</font>

264
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font>

265
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:20,340
be merged upstream like merging in the

266
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:24,960
master bunch soon so yeah like that's

267
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:27,940
that's the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps in infamous I</font>

268
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,500
explain most of what I wanted to show I

269
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,570
mean it's just like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any more</font>

270
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,170
questions or anything you would be just

271
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:38,260
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> having in to manage text enemies</font>

272
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,180
you know other tool or if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

273
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:45,069
interested in lectures on specific stuff

274
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:47,560
you would like to have in in Miss pimp i

275
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,050
miss that blue interested in yeah

276
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussing about that yeah my approach</font>

277
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do us let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as least</font>

278
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,010
amount of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I can when I actually</font>

279
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,530
play with a whisper and so I also know a

280
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,870
