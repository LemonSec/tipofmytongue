00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,479
good afternoon everyone first of all I

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:10,050
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank Chaka Khan</font>

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,200
organizers to provide such an amazing

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,630
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh actually I cannot imagine</font>

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,650
that one day I will have a chance to a

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,160
major public presentation with varying

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:26,698
sleepers short others and such kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,240
shirts it's a very awesome ok let's

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:34,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">begin my name is cloud and i'm working</font>

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,489
with pilotto networks and on the

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,290
antivirus our research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> development</font>

12
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:43,320
that's all I think others are no it's so

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,989
important so let's begin the topical is

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elias malware so some people are</font>

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:53,370
missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seriously though our iOS</font>

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,309
mobile really but the situation is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,930
over the past three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years this is a</font>

18
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:03,619
whole list of the new areas new iOS

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,619
malware family's been discovered and

20
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:11,220
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at the red one all</font>

21
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:14,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">read all the great ones are the mail</font>

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">wheels that ever affected down</font>

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,060
jailbroken devices and all italic ones

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,830
are those male well that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> indeed I</font>

25
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,320
post official apple store so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

26
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:35,070
could say from this reader that this is

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:38,460
a problem now oh also considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,610
believe that most of us should only use

29
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,559
non jailbroken devices in the daily walk

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:49,409
in knife how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people jailbroken you</font>

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,280
for all rooted your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android devices how</font>

32
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:59,040
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here only a few I think</font>

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:01,770
three or four people do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anyway</font>

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,630
the problem is that even you don't

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,890
jailbroke and your phone is still risky

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,109
this is what we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about today we were talking</font>

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how a non jailbroken iOS malware</font>

39
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,890
were pretty

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,980
used massively and then how to how they

41
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,099
were distributed and then how did the

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,069
evo<font color="#E5E5E5"> since and lost how the mid profit</font>

43
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:31,200
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that i would like to award</font>

44
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:36,030
some confusion first of all is a risky

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,048
or malicious in most<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases when we talk</font>

46
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:43,379
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> male well it means that it had</font>

47
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:48,389
malicious behaviors but today lots of

48
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:51,090
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> feminists that you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now say is</font>

49
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:53,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">so bad or so malicious cause of the</font>

50
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:57,269
restriction of the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> assistant is</font>

51
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:01,379
still pretty secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> save you so you can</font>

52
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:04,319
you say is risky that's that's what so

53
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,689
today we are using the world malware but

54
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,189
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risky well the potential and wanted</font>

55
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,849
a publication<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> future we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

56
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:15,060
included the second is that the in the

57
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:17,970
world or pork there are really many many

58
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,069
excellence security researchers in

59
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,430
spiritual academic researchers on the

60
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,319
approval concept of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware in the</font>

61
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,199
past eight years but today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are more</font>

62
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:32,790
talking about the real the actual

63
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:35,040
attacks ending for example when we

64
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:38,519
talking about windows or android or New

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:44,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">York malware that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usual means that those</font>

66
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:46,799
male well were are spread out<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly by</font>

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,099
some automatically way without users

68
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:54,900
knowledge user even<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not know it but</font>

69
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:58,138
on la's we will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> then more families</font>

70
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,540
are due to need user to do some

71
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,689
interactions with the devices for

72
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,790
example to in storage to click it to

73
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:11,569
impose something we will see many

74
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:14,939
examples of that way and then lots of

75
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:18,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Elway's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mel well do orange inflow from</font>

76
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">or targeted some regions in the world</font>

77
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:26,340
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> China so Oh some people</font>

78
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that why do we really</font>

79
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,299
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to care about</font>

80
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,880
if it's just the original problem the

81
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,030
answer is first of all some of the

82
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,090
feminist still affect all users around

83
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,780
the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example the Xcode goes</font>

84
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,210
affected I think more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundreds of</font>

85
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,000
countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world another</font>

86
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,659
answer is that some technicals that they

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">developed that they used were more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

88
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:59,310
more adopted by other attacks around the

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:02,070
world for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example are about about two</font>

90
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,520
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I found the real lookers that</font>

91
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,740
use the enterprise certificate to talk

92
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">non jailbroken devices and you know</font>

93
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">about are about half year later they</font>

94
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,120
were true one is begging teen another

95
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,760
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> up name is the one click fraud</font>

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,720
those 20 you all learn from it and use

97
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same way to a talk not jailbroken so</font>

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,470
the lots are the doctor concept is a

99
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:33,299
design flaw or code validity the pounds

100
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,360
of very awesome vulnerabilities that

101
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,590
been discovered year by year which could

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:44,610
lead to like information leaking or are

103
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,260
used for jailbreaking that's what we are

104
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">not talking about today we are talking</font>

105
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:53,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will talk about some few design</font>

106
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,210
flaws you can also say is or ability but

107
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:00,030
it's no some are<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's know some awesome</font>

108
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,330
reversing things but some is actually

109
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,450
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> by some design problems ok let's</font>

110
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">begin the first is how to produce the</font>

111
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:14,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">male well of course phalangeal broken so</font>

112
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:19,080
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you could you could develop</font>

113
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:22,680
single male well just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on demand but</font>

114
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:26,400
another problem is that how could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

115
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,440
massively produce them the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

118
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:39,600
this is actually idea that presented you

119
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,340
know 30 years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bay so do for 30 years</font>

120
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,810
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thompson</font>

technicals of our compelling theory but

answer is single day just one single

152
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:40,049
could add a fourth load with a pass to

object<font color="#CCCCCC"> fell after doing this one single</font>

154
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,779

160
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:03,810
this is actually the trick used by the

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:07,590
famous Xcode ghost this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan at the</font>

165
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:26,689
and the top the ad hoc existed in a

six-month<font color="#CCCCCC"> days without being discovered</font>

but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the term impact continuing</font>

168
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,720
till today this<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning I also saw some</font>

169
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,130

post CDN for downloading especially for

193
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:01,170
problem in some regions also developers

194
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,540
usually disable the gatekeeper cause of

195
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:07,199
some other developer development tools

196
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,000
popular tools something to note signed

200
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:22,230

<font color="#CCCCCC">7000 apps in apple store and these are</font>

hundreds of millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users around the</font>

203
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:32,520
world the worst case is that this

204
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,100
malware is actually vulnerable that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to traffic is so HTTP so you can hide</font>

206
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,800
jacket and through Hyde regular comments

207
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:44,040
you could reach an API named openurl

208
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,800
which is pretty dangerous that you could

209
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,430
through this API and fake the comments

210
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,099
to a install arbitrary<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad by fishing or</font>

211
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,459
you can even display some messages or

00:11:53,100 --> 00:12:00,570
display a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dialog article user to improve</font>

213
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:04,190
anything so till<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I have no idea how</font>

214
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:07,440
many still a lamp yeah but when these

215
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:10,740
families is a lab that this

216
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:15,450
vulnerability may lead to a serious

217
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:19,860
problem anyway is it only discovered

218
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:22,140
after half year<font color="#E5E5E5"> always be made by some</font>

219
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,930
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some developers recognize a</font>

220
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,170
blow more traffic of their app of their

221
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:33,530
own app and also this this is a

222
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:36,180
interesting story right<font color="#E5E5E5"> our this malware</font>

223
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:40,069
infinitely infected a super popular

224
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:43,560
social network app then even the other

225
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:47,660
himself not expected so that app brings

226
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:51,479
hundreds of millions of users which are

227
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,930
actually do is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> silver which</font>

228
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,550
hosted in amazon's AWS armored of course

229
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,370
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepted the so huge</font>

230
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:04,050
significant traffic but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font>

231
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:06,210
that that guys are created<font color="#E5E5E5"> card I've</font>

232
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,510
been out of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of so many</font>

233
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:12,330
traffic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> thus it was overdone and and</font>

234
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,120
then all the connection will will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

235
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:18,330
like one to two seconds which make a

236
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,209
huge delay<font color="#E5E5E5"> our huge delay of the apps</font>

237
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,649
launching and finally that social

238
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:29,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">network jeans</font>

239
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:31,709
the problem so I was suggestion to

240
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:34,680
prevent this problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

241
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:38,790
enable the gatekeeper and check the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex</font>

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:42,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">college integrity I verified I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> post</font>

243
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:45,269
method the method of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost effective the</font>

244
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:50,869
problem is that a viet<font color="#CCCCCC"> i check it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

245
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:55,309
spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two and half minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

246
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:58,259
thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many developers will</font>

247
00:13:55,309 --> 00:14:01,709
always perform this checking every time

248
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:05,540
you compel a single program by like two

249
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:08,849
or three minutes but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that</font>

250
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,149
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do know this is already need you to</font>

251
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:16,800

00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:32,219
also you can even detect<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether it is a</font>

in the procedure over campaigning and

there is load owning a single compiler

something for example you can children

problems that nobody could prevent or

provided a effective way to resolve the

problem another problem is that

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:20,899
third-party code is will also may be

00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,199
many insensitive about risky code I

292
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,330
think the answer should be that partly

293
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,690
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they would like to</font>

294
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">collect users information to our ok</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Somali this is actually a abused over</font>

296
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:41,189
users privacy data signal question is

297
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:44,130
that why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the sdk code is used</font>

298
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:48,060
risk and is a considerable problem the

299
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:52,740
problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipod do have a very good</font>

300
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:55,020
design sandbox 400 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> iOS app but let's</font>

301
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,380
think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't matta new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font>

302
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:01,829
or iOS or other plane phones the apps

303
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:04,380
sandbox is designed in the in the pan in

304
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bundle in the boundary of app it's</font>

305
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,470
just the perhaps everything inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

app share the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> commission share the</font>

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,690
same user and share the same data which

308
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,119
means actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a developer you</font>

309

<font color="#E5E5E5">adopted the code from third-party you</font>

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,920
and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party code could</font>

312
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,860
theoretical<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take control of all your</font>

313
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,370
data and share all your permission could

314
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,580
do ABC so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem you said how could</font>

315
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">you trust the day how to resolve this</font>

316
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,590
problem as we develop a soldier so that

317
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,949
only use<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known choice awards SDKs</font>

318
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:47,429
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's necessary to perform code</font>

319
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:51,020
review to us both source code and the

320
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:54,500
compounder<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our the binary code</font>

321
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,760
so another one is repackaging

322
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,820
repackaging is the main reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

323
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,690
enjoyed our mail well being so huge

324
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:05,370
number it's so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so owning or set the</font>

325
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,740
major of age who are basically we

326
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,310
produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android malware so now this</font>

327
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:15,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">technical come to a OS platform so you</font>

328
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:17,879
now is you could dick download some app

329
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:21,000
from apple store and decrypt the same

330
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:24,120
bisexuals and you add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic library</font>

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,750
into that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bundle and then you could</font>

332
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">patch the main bundle executable by</font>

333
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:34,170
adding a load command over load develop

334
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,030
and then fix the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac ojeda then you</font>

335
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,530
resent<font color="#CCCCCC"> the app by your own or</font>

336
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,540
certificate personal development

337
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,700
certificate and you could distribute

338
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:46,889
about some ways out I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

339
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:49,620
later so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually happen on</font>

340
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:53,460
malware for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example this one tiny tiny</font>

341
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:55,979
we'd be our repair dude every chart you

342
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,560
can be considered in the load command

343
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:02,670
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always say there is a load library</font>

344
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,520
by the executive lapels and pointed

345
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:08,010
through a PNG which is actually

346
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:12,600
microfilm and this one has ever ended

347
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:15,390
that will read the visuals are data and

348
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:19,919
upload your charting log as well as your

349
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:24,210
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay why people you install</font>

350
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:27,390
those kind of pirated<font color="#E5E5E5"> repaired apps or</font>

351
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:30,450
games there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons for example</font>

352
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:33,780
mostly recently or we know that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

353
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:37,410
a very popular game this is a what's the

354
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:42,570
name pokémon go how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here</font>

355
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:45,120
play pokemon go oh pretty many well so

356
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,550
pokemon gold there are two requirements

357
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,699
one is that in some regions over the

358
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:54,659
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> pokemon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gold dunno</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide service</font>

359
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:58,620
the signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said to play it you you</font>

360
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:01,320
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go outside and then to capture a</font>

361
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,689
monster but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some one</font>

362
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,240
to know one to go all set

363
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,179
or maybe for example if there is a

364
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,070
pikachu in da in<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House whatever</font>

365
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,559
you do walking into whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'll say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

366
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,678
hello Obama I want to capture monster in

367
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:19,500
your desk right so the requirement is

368
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,049
that you need to figure the GPS but if

369
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,230
your iphone is not jailbroken how to

370
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:28,019
figure GPS the way is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rebecca the game</font>

371
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:31,289
and then provided a developed to provide

372
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:35,309
it affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS location to cheating with</font>

373
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:38,250
again that's a requirement so although

374
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,678
after you produce the thousands of

375
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,419
malware how to distribute it the first

376
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">way and the major way is through the</font>

377
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:47,879
enterprise distribution so under prior

378
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,449
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used it so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

379
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:53,699
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are besides of the apple store</font>

380
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,320
it's a way they're provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

381
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplished so that you could</font>

382
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,350
distribute your own private app to

383
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,990
employees without public access and

384
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:10,049
without the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipod's review so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

385
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:12,419
know your internal code to gain a to

386
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:15,090
enloe into a are under prior

387

and as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little money and also</font>

390
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can even buy a such can double</font>

393
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,759
if you indeed cannot pay one-half

get his signing as a service that's a

396
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:43,918
lesson else to build since you know in

397
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">the underground anyway this one this</font>

398
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,740
method has a long history being abused

399
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:53,639
by the parotid apple store but then our

400
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:58,049
since the bell local it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a or begin</font>

401
00:21:53,639 --> 00:22:02,070
to abuse by the malware so this order is

00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:04,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">released after you send your abs through</font>

already been combined with lots of other

or traditional ad hoc basis like the

traffic hijacking all our rituals are

420
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,699
being used in you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> complements the</font>

421
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,480
website a decision so a pretty powerful

message<font color="#E5E5E5"> were distributed oh by the way</font>

423
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,470
this also used<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for some apps</font>

424
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-promotion Oh for example well when</font>

425
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:22,400
I visited some<font color="#E5E5E5"> top-ranked news website</font>

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:27,180
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. I also saw some similar problems</font>

427
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:30,420
huh so besides of enterprise there was a

428
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">program which is free that is a personal</font>

restrictions that as a personal

433
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,610
your own taste so you can only install

434
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:46,770
the new 100 devices but what

435
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:50,129
unbelievable<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the jig helpers</font>

436
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:53,670
these amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> feminine even trying to</font>

437
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,740
abuse this program our previously nobody

438
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,700
nobody's think this is possible because

439
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,760
it the restriction is no way to bypass

440
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:05,370
but this one is smart that he

441
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented everything in the Xcode to</font>

442
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:13,830
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate and then use it to</font>

443
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:16,950
generate a true<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pro a valid certificate</font>

444
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:20,389
from ipod server through your<font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone and</font>

445
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:24,810
then the download front front front

446
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:28,050
sewer from the mail we also see two

447
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:30,820
silver downloaded and same app and then

448
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:33,908
send everything in your own do

449
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:38,830
in the devices and then story in the

450
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:41,919
devices so it's a saint<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor devices and</font>

451
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:45,759
abuse this program the benefit is that

452
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:49,710
first of all is totally free and the

453
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:55,230
second is that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> poke a note I'll say</font>

454
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:59,139
this make hosted at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple will open</font>

455
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:03,149
thousands of certificate and no idea but

456
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:06,459
anyway this happen so medication<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

457
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:08,350
first of all if you are installed or

458
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,529
running it's underpriced that you can

459
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,649
send apps I Pavel ask you to double

460
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:17,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">conference that you translate all and in</font>

461
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:21,008
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the OS 9 you need to even</font>

462
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:24,340
click many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times to a topic on fringe</font>

463
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:26,830
and also every turn get a report of

464
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,918
malware of new discovered mobile app<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

465
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:32,559
real will recover revokes abuser

466
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,649
enterprise certificate but the problem

467
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that first of all if you want to get</font>

468
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:42,158
another one that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> low cost and</font>

469
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:45,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second is that even i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provoke lead</font>

470
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,179
in the silver<font color="#E5E5E5"> set there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still be a</font>

471
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:54,340
catch in the infected devices so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

472
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:56,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">joyce is no courage or revoke the</font>

473
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:01,418
certificate lists every day or every

474
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:04,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">hour are in actually courage in act</font>

475
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:08,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">three to seven days so it will kinds of</font>

476
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:10,389
results so after you revoked it or it

477
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:12,820
will take about three to seven days to

478
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:18,850
be effective in your devices this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

479
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:21,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">a window i have also reduced as a valid</font>

480
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,769
a date of personal certificate but

481
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:26,229
mostly ridiculous ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is thinking</font>

482
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:29,529
what months ago we're going to pour a

483
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:32,950
new or personal certificate from ipod

484
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:35,919
sewer and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> micro</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instance system told</font>

485
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,649
me this one you see our is in effective

486
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,570
right now i will no idea why that's a

487
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:44,080
totally new account that new certificate

488
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,600
anyway the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

489
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,449
try

490
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,179
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural male well under the apple</font>

491
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:53,090
store so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put two has days are</font>

492
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,220
cultivating but no details so nobody

493
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,949
know how they do it stayed even it

494
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,350
dynamically automatically or manually no

495
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,570
one knows but there are pretty many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

496
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:06,110
one just the first look the first method

497
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,450
is amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's not that you could</font>

498
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:12,260
I'll pee yourself you could exploit

499
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:15,980
yourself so you you embedded<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> P</font>

500
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,570
vulnerability in your own are so sorry

501
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,850
it's the option<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be obviously</font>

502
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:22,850
exploited<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure okay you invaded it</font>

503
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:26,719
one billet in your own app and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

504
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:29,810
exploit basic by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic to</font>

505
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,170
change the behavior but this is a silly

506
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:37,760
measure of this all that la successfully

507
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:40,580
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> offense or talk to apple store but</font>

508
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">a neighbor sees is used by drill mail</font>

509
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:46,879
well before and the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

510
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could perform code obfuscation to</font>

511
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,510
this is assumed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipod will have</font>

512
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:56,030
some experts you perform manually review

513
00:27:53,510 --> 00:28:00,680
to your code and also this could bypass

514
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:02,899
some now security<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys that are also it</font>

515
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,720
could bypass and automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> rose to</font>

516
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,270
detector code so the ones that you could

517
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,300
target a certificate data for example

518
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:14,720
these are examples that freedom of the

519
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:17,810
instant age in the in steady will our it

520
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,240
prevailed functionality like who viewed

521
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:22,820
your Instagram pages this is a

522
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,670
functionality that the Instagram

523
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">operation is not provided but these apps</font>

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:31,550
provided our actual you can steal social

525
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:34,490
i bestow back who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about who kills</font>

526
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:37,159
with me or or in study Tector insta

527
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:41,240
analyze everything exam you will still

528
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:44,180
feel awesome apps like that but these

529
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,160
these are apps we are actually uploaded

530
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:50,420
the password you<font color="#E5E5E5"> imported through the</font>

531
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:56,180
sewer and also there were some our apps

532
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:58,040
that will steal what happen the first

533
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">message to our with the</font>

534
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,250
to apple store is that you could perform

535
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">checking of the environment of execution</font>

536
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:08,770
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could determine the</font>

537
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:11,660
geolocation you could determine sample

538
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:14,389
the IPO juice you could determine the

539
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:18,110
language of devices this is assume that

540
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:21,500
the manually reviewing of the of the

541
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:24,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipod's region is performed by some</font>

542
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in some locations in specific at</font>

543
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:31,460
hand so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could provide a</font>

544
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:33,830
app to apple store and disable the

545
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:37,270
normal functionality through network off

546
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:41,270
for like two weeks after two weeks are

547
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:44,300
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> past the cultivating you could enable</font>

548
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,760
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through network traffic so for</font>

549
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">example this is a male well that during</font>

550
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,780
the if you access<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by devices in</font>

551
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:56,240
English<font color="#CCCCCC"> all or acts are visited are</font>

outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the channel you will see it's</font>

553
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,810
a english learning app so i can imagine

554
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:06,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i post waiting guy are listening</font>

555
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:09,110
the good morning or it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wake up</font>

556
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,020
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crab but actually if you are</font>

557
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:16,580
accessing enough from the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

558
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:19,550
china your Gators are so the party apple

559
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:23,020
store yeah it's a soda party apple store

560
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:26,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">clent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in official apple store I</font>

561
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:28,639
can't imagine I can say okay the<font color="#CCCCCC"> North</font>

562
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">why's that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you could just do it</font>

563
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:37,340
is the ipods those cold<font color="#CCCCCC"> ratings and use</font>

564
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:40,850
far far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what we sort is not</font>

565
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:43,750
restricted at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so for example</font>

566
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:46,879
this one actually saw same way it

567
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:50,210
contains so many insensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> AP is and</font>

568
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:54,050
so many sensitive streams in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code in</font>

569
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:57,500
plain text that we could read pretty

570
00:30:54,050 --> 00:31:00,379
many of rules to college<font color="#CCCCCC"> 21 it let's</font>

571
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:04,420
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> high advantage but it bypassed</font>

572
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:08,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">i will store again again and again i</font>

573
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:11,270
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt the cultivating to resist</font>

574
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,989
ok so the medication is that first of

575
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,710
all you could

576
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:18,230
movies for<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple store but there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

577
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:21,380
remote Keaney which means if you have

iron storage to mitigating a signal

580
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:31,040
problem is that you could theoretically

581
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:33,020
adopt a more restricted review but the

582
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,360
most nervous the most original changes

583
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:39,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your body months ago I</font>

our time will reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the front a week to</font>

586
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:52,790
a day I can image how<font color="#E5E5E5"> could they improve</font>

587
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:57,889
the code review in this way so another

588
00:31:52,790 --> 00:32:00,320
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> so choose through the USB so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all at</font>

589
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,570
the first you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> using any USB</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it you can use a rechargeable power bank</font>

593
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:17,000
to install malware and you will actively

even notice the baggage how to mitigate

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,960
though are some technical way for

609

616
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,530
this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:32,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">and medicine that design for at the</font>

00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:34,830
first designed for ipod<font color="#E5E5E5"> about i think is</font>

621
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:43,860
the music's drm protection so the

622
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">logical is that you purchase the music</font>

00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,959
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> app from apple store and then</font>

624
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,690
download it to your pc or your mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

625
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,660
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> installed these</font>

626
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:59,880
apps or sink this music from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc or</font>

627
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:05,550
mac to your iphone or ipod so the sink

628
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:08,460
presidio is that the device will send a

629
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:10,918
soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as and data to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone out sort</font>

00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,649
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> your computer and you computer</font>

631
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,658
make a response to your phone which me

632
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:19,440
are this procedure<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used that you</font>

633
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:23,310
approve that the computer has really

634
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:27,030
purchased valid beautiful app from the

635
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:31,399
Apple Store so i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some design</font>

636
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:36,450
that from the from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipod ipod a</font>

637
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:39,359
design that first of all or issue has

638
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:42,060
restrictions that each apple ID could

639
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,270
note banded visa and most of five

640
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:47,639
computers but you to know restricted how

641
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:50,580
many iphones or ipod or ipad you could

642
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,190
use so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe because I</font>

643
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:56,879
the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are into any apple store</font>

644
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,130
on iPod so anyway and the second that

645
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,650
you're in production is only really one

646
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,450
with the app is no readable visa<font color="#E5E5E5"> I apply</font>

647
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,650
these know really believe is the devices

648
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:09,720
so which means that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I downloaded an</font>

649
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:13,109
app from apple store and you downloaded

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,939
one through ten oh dear hope you are you

651
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:19,230
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same they are protected by</font>

652
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:21,630
the same key<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I posted a is</font>

that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> related the security of this</font>

00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:03,350
that also incision code could also use

all the behavior of these families so

689
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:25,620
mostly critical behavior is that it will

700
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,310
is that immediately remove it right just

first of all Mel well especially a less

00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:47,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mel well it's pretty different with</font>

866

on it to note should be out manually to

be many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different forms or ways to</font>

873
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:09,740
perform the top the second takeaway is

874
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:12,690
that they are worried are some practical

875
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:16,979
although low-tech<font color="#E5E5E5"> but still practical</font>

876
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:19,260
the effective way to a don't you talk

877
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:23,010
and some technicals has been mitigated

878
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:28,050
but some still haven't or have no way

879
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:30,420
and through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this through research on the</font>

880
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,970
approaches and through research on the

881
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:38,030
reasons through the reasons I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

882
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:40,859
could our fund more in the world later

883
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,690
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some security suggestions</font>

884
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,390
of the most important is thinking that

885
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:48,930
do not install app from third party or
