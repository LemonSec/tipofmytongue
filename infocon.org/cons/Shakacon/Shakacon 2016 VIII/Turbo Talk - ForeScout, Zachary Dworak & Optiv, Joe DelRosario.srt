00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,479
specifically with the security tools

the investments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they already own</font>

so how could<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Scout help and what</font>

51
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,849
exactly do we do if i can relate for

<font color="#CCCCCC">scout into three words it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be C</font>

control and orchestrates sort of further

54
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,590
explore what exactly we do and each

55
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,379
phase the sea<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece is all about</font>

56
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,930
identifying every IP adjustable device

57
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:40,989
on your network in real time we're doing

58
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,700
that without the need of an agent so we

59
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,519
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be totally agentless if need be</font>

60
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,768
we're also vendor agnostic when it comes

61
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,099
to switching as well unlike some of our

62
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:53,109
competitors we see every managed and

unmanaged device in real time as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

64
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:57,810
mentioned so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the managed</font>

65
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pcs macs small devices</font>

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,670
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> includes those managed devices</font>

67
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,888
that may go undetected such as patches

68
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,700
being broken or disabled it could be a

69
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:11,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Navy being out of dates perhaps and then</font>

70
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">we also see those unmanaged devices so</font>

71
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,699
this could be mobile device hotspots

72
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:22,150
BYOD IOT type devices even your IP

73
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:24,840

74
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,090
possibly in your conference board room

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,620
so when we speak to our customers

76
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,239
generally they'll see their network

77
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,099
visibility something like this well

78
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,500
they're only see a very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> percentage</font>

79
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,940
of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed devices and then lack</font>

80
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,040
that visibility and the rest of their

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,349
environment for<font color="#E5E5E5"> scout makes that</font>

83
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it all without the requirement of an</font>

84
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,099

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and I'll touch on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and another</font>

86
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,918
slider to that we fully integrate with

87
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,810
other security tools in your

88
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,659
environments so just to name a few their

sim a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TD vulnerability assessment tools</font>

90
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,638
MDM type tools as well the control piece

91
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,470
is the second piece and it's all about

92
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,750
hardening the network basically

93
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,510
preventing a breach<font color="#E5E5E5"> from happening in</font>

94
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,280
the first place and enforcing policies

95
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,679
that you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already established or</font>

96
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">custom built policies so we do this by</font>

learning the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user we can also segment a</font>

another type of user off on a separate

100
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:29,400

102
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,900
third and<font color="#E5E5E5"> final piece and this is all</font>

103
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">about leveraging the security tools that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">visibility certainly don't have to take</font>

149
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,039
my word for it Gartner has leveraged us

150
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,800
or has identified us i should say as a

151
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,039
leader in their space for the past four

152
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,139
to five years among other subscriptions

153
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,460

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,120
give you his background and furthermore

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,590
the partner benefits that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,590

159
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:59,400
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks Zach my name is</font>

162
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,500
my client account managers also kento me

163
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,830
so we are the local team here in Hawaii

164
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,590
for optiv I've got this slide here first

165
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,810
and foremost I wanted to see who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

166
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:21,479
question who actually knows who optiv is

167
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:26,280
show of hands who knew of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cue vont or</font>

168
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,900
fish net in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

169
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this as more the kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font>

170
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,068
an education of what's been going on

171
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,370
over the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year or so so as you can</font>

172
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:37,770
see here optiv is the creation or them

173
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,449
from the merger<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a coupon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and fishnet</font>

174
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can see where part of the</font>

175
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Blackstone portfolio companies so they</font>

176
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:46,440
essentially purchased both companies for

177
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,090
about a year year and a half ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

178
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,340
was just a natural synergy to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

179
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:54,479
merge the two companies so we've got the

180
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,549
strengths of both and as part of that

181
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,960
that now makes us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market leading</font>

just pure<font color="#CCCCCC"> plays cybersecurity the</font>

185
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,568

188
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,199

192
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:27,000
weird because of the merger we were at

193
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:30,770
two billion in sales last year and were

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,289
targeted to go to about 2.5 this year

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:37,130
looking to double in about<font color="#CCCCCC"> three four</font>

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,569
the way from the sea so level to give a

225

229
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,900
there and as you can see we've also got

the whole cycle of what we cover in the

all the way to the monitoring we also

manage security services for the SEM

236
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,010
things like that and then through all

your defenses and controls the actual

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:25,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">endpoints or the actual solutions at the</font>

239
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:27,060
bottom this just goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of what</font>

240
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do specifically on a security service</font>

241
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,260
east side so from<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything on a security</font>

242
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,050
consulting so that would be strategy you

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">know like risk of compliance design</font>

244
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,079
architecture implementation and from the

245
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,660
security operations side we've got our

246
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,010
managed services and for this I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

247
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,350
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> side it goes into the details of</font>

248
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,630
actual products and solutions that we

249
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,760
offer managed services for it and then

250
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,980
also on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology side where we can</font>

251
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,520
do migrations optimization any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

or products for any customer this just

254
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,080
goes into more detail pretty much of the

255
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,420
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing as far as like how we do</font>

256
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,220
advisory services for pen testing

257
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,719
vulnerability assessments things like

258
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,750
that and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design on the</font>

259
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,279
architecture implementation side we also

260
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,190
do the education awareness we have a

261
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,630
security awareness training that we do I

262
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,639
know a lot of that's that's one of the

263
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,470
key things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are out there we</font>

264
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,600
actually even<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it implemented our</font>

265
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:28,199
selves where I've actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just saw</font>

266
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,970
this morning an email that I know is a

267
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,560
phishing email so I did not click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

268
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,300
and I've actually done it before where

269
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,529
yes I actually clicked on a phishing

270
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,660
email and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually one of the</font>

271
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,790
tests so it's a constantly monthly thing

272
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,130
that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have testing our</font>

273
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,360
controls within optiv so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do</font>

274
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,730
that within ourselves so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

275
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,260
do the same thing for customers like

276
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,959
yourselves as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> that security</font>

277
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,060
awareness training and and the applied

278
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,279
research is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting as well</font>

279
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,899
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have that's a lot of</font>

280
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,519
where we do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zero-day research we</font>

281
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,040
also have our own threat to<font color="#CCCCCC"> intel in</font>

00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,019
feed feed we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have something</font>

283
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,339
that feeds into<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk you know it's</font>

284
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,810
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that so that's part of</font>

285
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,070
a lot of what we've done on the applied

286
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,229
research side and we can actually do

287
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,360
custom research as well that we've done

288
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,670
I've heard of some crazy projects of

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,140
type of stuff we've got about 80 think

305
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,699
now about 80 or 90 former CISOs from all
