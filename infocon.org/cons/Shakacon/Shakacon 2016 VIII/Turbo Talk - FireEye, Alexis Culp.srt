1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
thank you very much so I'm Alexa sculpt

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,739
I'm a channel systems engineer with fire

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,410
I consulting systems engineer this year

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,450
so we're going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three</font>

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,130
pillars that you need in an organization

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,779
I did talk about this one slide last

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,479
year so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry if it's repetitive but</font>

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,630
it's still true you need technology now

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,949
fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> i has some interesting technology</font>

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,849
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own hypervisor that we</font>

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,640
built around security so unlike the

12
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:35,309
hypervisor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware has or Microsoft</font>

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,559
this is designed for security so masking

14
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,149
the fact that it's in a vm making sure

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,780
logs are incremented things of that

16
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,250
nature that technology helps us detect

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,829
unknown threats it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps us block</font>

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,390
known threats we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have great packet</font>

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,950
capture technology a whole slew of

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,360
technology and tools for saw

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,190
augmentation for incident response you

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,050
can buy all the technology on the block

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have every piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of gear ever</font>

24
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,788
created but if it's not populated with

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,090
useful actionable intelligence its shelf

26
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,380
where we've got a lot of intelligence at

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,470
fireeye we get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from three different</font>

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,270
places one is from the technology itself

29
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,070
learns right it learns about unknown

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,080
threats it shares that intelligence with

31
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,059
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our other gear shares that</font>

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,280
intelligence in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the form of Intel papers</font>

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,430
and whatnot we also have adversary

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,920
intelligence so going out and searching

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,659
forums and chat rooms and seeing what

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,850
kind of exploits are for sale kind of

37
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,979
data is for sale to get a finger<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

38
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,149
pulse of where the threat actors are

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,829
moving today where is<font color="#E5E5E5"> their most</font>

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,900
lucrative thing today third piece you

41
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,880
need you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the technology out</font>

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,610
there you can populate it with all the

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,979
useful intelligence ever created but if

44
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,890
you do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it it's again</font>

45
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">shelfwear so you need experts and we</font>

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,570
have experts around the globe at fireeye

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,250
doing incident response we do about

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 300 different organizations</font>

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,729
dealing with incident response and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over some statistics from</font>

53
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,760
last year's incident response so if we

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look we've been doing ir for 11</font>

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,459
years in the

56
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,290
mandiant side of fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> I we take a look</font>

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">at how long an average thread actor</font>

stays resonant and<font color="#E5E5E5"> undetected in a</font>

59
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,270
network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been</font>

60
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,579
some success we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen improvement</font>

61
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,310
across organizations with their cyber

62
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,310
security posture really good improvement

63
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,560
but who here thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> 146 days is still</font>

64
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay for somebody to be in the network</font>

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,050
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to own that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network any hands right</font>

66
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,489
that's still too long right I've taken

67
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,790
everything in the kitchen sink I know

68
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,200
your processes procedures I know where

69
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,170
your databases are have taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,970
databases taking credentials most likely

71
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,619
I've set up a VPN account and I have

72
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,020
domain admin privileges and I don't even

73
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">need malware to infect the network at</font>

74
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,710
that point or take data out of the

75
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:01,470
network so last year in 2015 we<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed</font>

76
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,580
a few trends that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlight</font>

77
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,560
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we've seen an increase in</font>

78
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,550
business disruption attack so these

79
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:13,200
would be not the stealthy slow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

80
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,910
attacks that were used to but more noisy

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,769
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example would be a nation-state not</font>

82
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,230
wanting somebody to release a movie and

83
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,570
being very public about that another

84
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,149
example would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be maybe taking a machine</font>

85
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,160
and holding<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for ransom how about an</font>

86
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,450
adult website that then sends you an

87
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,190
email when their stuff is stolen

88
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,780
somebody sends you an email and says I

89
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,640
have all the emails that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've ever</font>

90
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,470
sent on this adult website and I want to

91
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">give it to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wife if you don't pay me</font>

92
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,650
some bitcoins so a lot of business

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,410
disruption a lot of noisy attacks we've

94
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,540
also seen an increase in lost personal

95
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,200
identifiable information specifically

96
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,940
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> China and the third piece is that</font>

97
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,910
we've seen a tax on routers and switches

98
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,500
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that most incident</font>

99
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:01,660
responders traditionally would have

100
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,250
overlooked when doing I are so what's

101
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,730
the motivation behind a disruption

102
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:09,040
attack well there's financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivation</font>

103
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,679
for the ransomware there's political

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,260
motivation when<font color="#CCCCCC"> its nation state</font>

105
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,269
sponsored and then we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> also seen some</font>

106
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,789
attacks where they're wiping complete

107
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,329
database systems and wiping control

108
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,610
systems critical infrastructure systems

109
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,539
completely wiping there's no financial

110
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,850
gain there's no political gain

111
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,740
and then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> your standard leaking</font>

112
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,910
of confidential data to your wiki leaks

113
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,950
to the press to paste bin I would be

114
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,500
remiss<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I didn't talk about the number</font>

115
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,590
one thing on everybody's mind from 2015

116
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,520
and it's still a hot topic this year if

117
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,130
you've ever had the displeasure of

118
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,469
seeing one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these screens and you</font>

119
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,969
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good eye</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on what's</font>

120
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,200
happening in the organization these are

121
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,820
the screens that you see when that

122
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,560
machine's been completely encrypted and

123
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,940
it's too late ransomware has been common

124
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,340
there's different variants coming out

125
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,780
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a monthly basis and one</font>

126
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is the</font>

127
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,489
hackers have learned the risk profile

128
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,250
that the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> also takes when</font>

129
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,690
they make cybersecurity purchases so

130
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,850
when I'm an organization looking to make

131
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,920
a purchase for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security or to</font>

132
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,160
enhance<font color="#CCCCCC"> my cyber security posture I way</font>

133
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,260
my risk versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost hackers are</font>

134
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,180
doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing was only 17 grand</font>

135
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,210
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital shell out the money in</font>

136
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,630
Los Angeles it's a pretty low amount of

137
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,909
money so if you do that multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

138
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:35,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just with</font>

139
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:38,060
small attacks like ransomware how about

140
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,740
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> held for ransom you might not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

141
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,510
be aware of these kind of breaches this

142
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,010
is where the executive<font color="#CCCCCC"> staff or somebody</font>

143
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,520
in the organization gets an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email</font>

144
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,890
notifying them about something could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

emails between the organization talking

149
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,630
about public figures could be something

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,940
political in nature they demand a ransom

151
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,560
and then they give you a deadline all

152
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,710
via email you don't even know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,600
attack is real you have to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out is</font>

154
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,750
it real am I going to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

155
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,400
what's my risk and then the smart move

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,070
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about paying that</font>

159
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,239
maybe trace where that payment ends up

160
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,130
let's talk about the personal

September this is that lateral spread

187

nightmare that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always talk about so</font>

you get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> infection in the network you</font>

191
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:34,188
next thing you know you think you've

192
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,779
cleaned up that threat but it still

193
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:37,969
keeps coming back how is it spreading

194
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,919
laterally well these guys went ahead and

195
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:43,729
infected a cisco iOS router with the

at a cisco router and try to compare

199

whether or not a file has been added

200

ten percent so ninety percent of you

need to think about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you going</font>

299
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,800
to do when you get the ransomware do you

00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,480
have a good backup and plan in place

301

there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with</font>

backup recently another one would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to</font>

306
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,430

307
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,989
if you see lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of files being modified</font>

308
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,089

317
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,610
