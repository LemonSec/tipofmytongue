been here before and I hope you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are</font>

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,799
having a good time to want to thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,350
organizers and the the guys that and

women that read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the papers and and all</font>

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,529
the volunteers and stuff like that my

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,420
delighted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see all you people here and</font>

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,990
I mean a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people here for this</font>

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,059
hour of the morning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a little a</font>

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,980
little surprised that you're all here

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,709
instead of at the beach where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,230
I'm sure it's a lot more fun and I'm

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,879
only partly kidding about that i mean

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,230
the title of the talk is hunting

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,180
government back doors not like

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,890
announcing new ones if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was announcing</font>

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,860
new ones you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel entitled to</font>

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an audience but no this is</font>

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,120
really more about the journey i'm going

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,410
to talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones i've</font>

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,899
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring to light others have</font>

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,989
brought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> life over the last decade or</font>

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">so but it's it's really more about the</font>

26
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,060
journey and where it goes from here I

27
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,280
think they're there is a substantial

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,290
point2 talking about that though for

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,290
journalists and for researchers like

30
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,900
yourselves government officials

31
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,220
executives and regular people who i

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:26,520
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd be pretty interested in this</font>

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:29,579
if they aren't already there at some

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,610
point as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said and going back over what</font>

35
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,369
we've learned and thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

36
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,250
still don't know and thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we we did figure out what we know and</font>

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,740
with that hopefully we can figure out

39
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,310
how to start drinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the rest of it</font>

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,289
so you bear with me but there is a sort

41
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,670
of a long arc here that were that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

42
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,670
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to where we find out more</font>

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,759
about this stuff just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a level set on the</font>

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,939
slides I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a visual person</font>

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,969
there that I was 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> deaveon had 200</font>

46
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,008
slides I'm gonna have 18 and they're

47
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great for resting your eyes if</font>

48
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want some place to look other than</font>

49
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,829
me but they are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the foundation of</font>

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,390
this talk they're just illustrations

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,840
that's that's just the way it is so

52
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,839
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

53
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:22,290
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Who I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I'm here I'm my name is</font>

54
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:24,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">Joe man my byline is Joseph and I've got</font>

55
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,370
the profound good fortune<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be working</font>

56
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,099
as an investigative journalist at a

57
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,019
solvent company which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

58
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:39,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to do when I was in high school</font>

59
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:41,700
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay 35 and it's a</font>

60
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:44,069
wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> privileged job and with that</font>

61
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,230
especially if you're at a large media

62
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,429
company that is solvent I think there's

63
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,918
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of responsibility so with that in</font>

64
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,930
mind I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask your indulgence for</font>

65
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,199
the first part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this talk as I talk a</font>

66
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:02,040
little bit about the ethics of choosing

67
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:05,280
to report on this stuff I don't usually

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,040
hear a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about ethics and security</font>

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
cons and my best guess is that it's

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,219
because ethics are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of squishy and</font>

71
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,840
knowledge isn't and everybody has their

72
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:17,638
own ethics and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hard as a</font>

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,169
general rule to convince somebody that

74
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,569
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethics are wrong and your ethics</font>

75
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,949
are right so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> people just try to</font>

76
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:26,578
pass on knowledge and let<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do what</font>

77
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:30,930
they want with the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

78
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">really disagree with any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

79
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,509
having covered tech security since 1999

80
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,519
I feel like one of the tricky bits of

81
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:40,500
the industry is that there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

82
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,780
of discussion and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something of a</font>

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,829
vacuum<font color="#CCCCCC"> or at least a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ when it comes</font>

84
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,569
to ethical issues there's no course on

85
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,000
ethics that I know of its required<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

86
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,298
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer science majors or EE</font>

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,579
majors and for that matter there's no e

88
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,459
major or computer science major it's

89
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,870
required for success in security so even

90
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,359
if it was required<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm not sure what</font>

91
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,159
instruction folks would get and if

92
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,359
sometimes wish that there was there for

93
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:12,539
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like a 1-800 ethical like a</font>

94
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,699
hotline not so a hacker researcher with

95
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,620
a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> could get the answer right</font>

96
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,799
away from some great guru but to help

97
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,380
facilitate<font color="#E5E5E5"> a discussion about it for</font>

98
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,960
those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't used to it I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">regressing here but I just want to give</font>

100
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,150
you a general alert that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take morality</font>

101
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,610
see

102
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,948
seriously and before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get into a talk</font>

103
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">about finding back doors that you know</font>

00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,170
the point is it's pretty interesting I

433
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,149
believe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be reported given the</font>

434
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,059
convoluted and often unknowable chain of

435
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,620
custody involved in these sorts of

436
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,750
issues I've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the conclusion that</font>

437
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,419
back doors are back doors<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they</font>

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,210
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> collecting which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brings me to</font>

439
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,059
another recurring theme who is doing the

440
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,559
collecting philosophically most of the

441
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,629
security community probably agree is

442
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all back doors are bad maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

443
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,850
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of their own shortcuts for</font>

444
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:21,160
remote support and again it can often be

445
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">an oval unknowable exactly what's going</font>

446
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,530
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> but as with targeting I think there's</font>

447
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,510
a continuum if undocumented access that

448
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,460
circumvent security is a reasonable

449
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,350
definition of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoor then a tech</font>

450
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,170
support loophole is arguably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the least</font>

451
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,090
worst then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more general</font>

452
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,800
purpose corporate access like the Sony

453
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,870
digital rights management rootkit

454
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,590
debacle not to be confused with any of

455
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,850
the other sony security debacles

456
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,470
organized or independent hackers leaving

457
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:51,428
themselves a means back in are probably

458
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:54,240
worse than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that another country having</font>

459
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:56,500
access to all customers or product X is

460
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:04,990
very hard to distinguish from that but

461
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:06,130
arguably worse still and then there's

462
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question of where I put my own</font>

463
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">countries back door as worse than all</font>

464
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:14,830
those say<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an American company to</font>

465
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:17,889
spy on Americans like an annoying number

466
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:19,659
of answers I think it depends as a

467
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,210
threat to an individual it actually

468
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">depends wildly if I were in an extremely</font>

469
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,720
repressive place and I was a bit of a

470
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,860
dissident I would rather have the

471
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,580
American spy on me than my own

472
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,590
government if I were a nice friendly

473
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,189
democracy I might rather have my own

474
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,590
government spy on me than the Americans

475
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,330
if I'm literally talked about myself to

476
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,678
pet it depends what I'm reporting on and

477
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,010
therefore like what day of the week it

478
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,990
is but which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bigger global</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think that these sort of own</font>

489
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,990
industry truism is that security through

490
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,460
obscurity fails in the end because it

491
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,900
will eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be worth someone's time</font>

pretty obscure in every country and

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore it's worth while exploring</font>

companies are stuck in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this intersection</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of intersections</font>

of a capitalist entity to make money

they're responsible to their

shareholders and to some extent

510
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,620
accountable to their customers but

511
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,139
they're pressed more often by subtle and

unsubtle pressure from the government's

bigger lessons that<font color="#CCCCCC"> EDD Snowden brought</font>

us from Hawaii and all the more reason

instructive value as you know they're

528
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,190
going to great many stories based on the

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an aside and I don't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

531
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,760
sound ungrateful for the information but

532
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,470
a majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the published documents</font>

533
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,590
have been about NSA techniques and

534
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,730
capabilities if you accept the fact that

535
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,679
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> country is going to have an</font>

536
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,570
intelligence agency you will probably

537
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,060
want them to have pretty awesome

capabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think more important</font>

questions are how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got those</font>

540
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,530
capabilities and even more important

<font color="#E5E5E5">than that</font>

542

they do with them and I wish we'd had

00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:22,810
more stories on that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far I think we</font>

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't in part because of access</font>

limitations what Snowden what's known

546
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,250
and others could see and in part because

547
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,350
the agencies have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been reluctant to</font>

548
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,870
explain very much on those on those

549
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,540
points there's been something of an

550
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:40,989
exception with the phone calling

database<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the CDR is calling calling</font>

552
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:47,110

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,610
initial alarm and on the way to some

554
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,260
fairly substantial changes some of the

650
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,810
experts what I found most surprising was

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people had been poking holes in it</font>

658
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:08,580
more I looked into it the weirder it got

<font color="#CCCCCC">Xiumin Ferguson weren't the first to say</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">dual EC some others said they hadn't</font>

662
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,610
bothered to complain because they

663
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,570
assumed that nobody would use it

664
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,520
especially when there are three other

665
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,100
choices to get certification for some

666
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,960
government contracts one of the

667
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,270
defense's that's been raised for dual EC

668
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,700
was that whoever adopted it could pick

669
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,120
their own constant but if they did then

670
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,440
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get automatic certification</font>

671
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,120
finally it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like dual EC had</font>

672
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,560
amazing other<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful qualities that</font>

673
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,629
might have mitigated the fact that it

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,179
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be back doored in fact it was</font>

675
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,340
orders of magnitude slower than the

<font color="#E5E5E5">other alternatives in other words it</font>

677
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:50,669
stunk even before was exposed as rotten

678
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,960
now if you're a technology vendor has

679
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,760
gone through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble of getting</font>

folks that need a certified vendor so i

683
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,710
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of tech companies reporting</font>

that they were certified for using dual

<font color="#CCCCCC">ec knowing what i did about how lousy</font>

688
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,150
can still see how some company that did

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,970
a ton of business with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government</font>

690
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,790
and companies that mimic government

691
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:23,910
requirements would want to be certified

692
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:26,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">in every possible way so then I started</font>

693
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:29,880
looking about looking for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

695
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,130
again how did dual<font color="#E5E5E5"> EC make its presence</font>

696
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,160
the most felt who jumped in with both

697
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,150
feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went through the list again</font>

698
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,640
looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> who would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have played a</font>

699
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,290
major role in the tech ecosystem and one

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,960
called RSA now RSA is not enormous but

702
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,790
it put dual<font color="#E5E5E5"> EC in a toolkit that was</font>

707

struck me it may dual<font color="#E5E5E5"> EC the default</font>

708
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,140
that means if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RSA</font>

709
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,240
toolkit you could put in some effort and

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,700
pick one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the three other demonstrably</font>

713
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,370
the easy thing and went with the

714

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure that out and in</font>

735
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,380
December 2013 I published a story saying

736
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,510
that RSA had taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten million dollars</font>

737
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:20,490
in a federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract that required it</font>

738
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:21,870
to use dual<font color="#E5E5E5"> EC as the default the crux</font>

739
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,250
of that story came from two anonymous

740
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,229
sources and I'm certainly not going to

741
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,670
out them here but I can tell you a

742
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,290
little bit about how they came to light

743
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:30,090
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might make it</font>

744
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:33,510
easier for others to do similar work and

745
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,100
I think this work is important early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

746
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,350
in the process I tried to come up with

747
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,790
hypotheses but how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal might have</font>

748
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,159
come to pass and who would have known

749
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:43,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it and I thought about the winners</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> losers internally and externally who</font>

751
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,830
would have been pleased about that kind

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deal and who would have been angry</font>

753
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,710
at the time and after its exposure I was

754
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for a specific act between</font>

756
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,959

perhaps not minding if people

after reading it a third time I saw

1052
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,910
there was another way to read the

sentence that RSA did not know that dual

1054

1205
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,230
for example there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different random</font>

that one that random number generator

1214
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:36,619
never came into play at all it's very

1215
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">impressive to me what happened in less</font>

1216
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:41,109
than a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the initial</font>

it was in 08 after the exposure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:53,970
really encouraging to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1222
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:56,368
I asked um I asked general Hayden<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

which are nobody but us capabilities

that only the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US can exploit and he said</font>

1226
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:07,078
he's lost a lot of faith in the ability

of no basis to stay nobis we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what happened to Juniper</font>

1229
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:14,640
still but if they put in if the NSA

00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,680
indirectly or directly put in dual<font color="#E5E5E5"> EC</font>

1231
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,410

00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">converted by some outside party then</font>

1233
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:26,970
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty compelling argument</font>

1234

1237
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,680
the simplest answer would be to change

00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,860
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fan</font>

1342
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,839

1343
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,300
there's deliberate vulnerabilities

1344
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:17,230
everywhere to say nothing of accidental
