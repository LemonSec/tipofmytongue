63
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,459
the differences between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> plastic used to answer phone calls on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">wireless communication technology or a</font>

designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exchange data over short</font>

73
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,690
low power consumption and it came out as

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,959
a part of bluetooth version<font color="#E5E5E5"> four dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

75
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,030
and if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the peak of current</font>

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,519
consumption section over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

77
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,400
really evident that the end is ideal for

78
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,970
devices running on coin cell batteries

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,060
or your lightweight devices such as

80
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,940
variables or smart pay systems etc and

81
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,739
your typical use cases for<font color="#CCCCCC"> big blue to</font>

82
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,180
classic would be wireless speakers

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth protocol stack there are</font>

87
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,019
five main components<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest here</font>

88
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,629
the gap or genetic access profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

89
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,909
is responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discover devices and</font>

00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,670
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how they connect to each other</font>

91
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,920
and the genetic attribute profile which

92
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,099
describes the characteristics or the

93
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,560
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are available for on each</font>

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,870

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,699
characteristics<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any data that is</font>

97
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,979
is described as a characteristic so if

<font color="#CCCCCC">your temperature data or any sensor data</font>

99
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,008
is

100
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,770
going back and forth it is identified by

<font color="#CCCCCC">the use of characteristics SP which is</font>

data among your PR devices and the l2cap

107

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,030
understand how<font color="#CCCCCC"> Billy works over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> air</font>

111
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,280
there are two important concepts that

112
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,770
one needs to understand the concept of

113
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,320
advertising and also the concept of

114
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,659
connection interval so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

115
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,880
example we have a variable device here

116
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,940
which is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> known as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the broadcaster</font>

117
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,740
and it has some data of interest that it

118
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,410
would like to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with pure ble</font>

119
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,840
devices and we have an observer here say

120
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,789
your mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone which is interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

121
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,840
receiving the data that is transmitted

122
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:27,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">by the observer and the way observer or</font>

123
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,219
the width broadcaster sends out that

124
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,500
this data is available is using an

125
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,380
advertising packet which is transmitted

126
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,830
at frequent intervals known as your

127
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:41,219
advertising interval and the observer

128
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,190
scans over a pset range of frequencies

129
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,530
and once it realizes that there is data

130
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,110
available that is of interest it sends

131
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:52,049
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a connection request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the</font>

132
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,389
broadcaster and once the broadcaster

133
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,330
accepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> a connection they assume the</font>

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,639
role of GATT server and gat line again

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,930
establishes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important to</font>

141

power consumption we spoke earlier and

147
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,770
before moving on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> barely security</font>

148
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,120
let's take a look at the pairing

149
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,740
algorithms used<font color="#E5E5E5"> because these are</font>

150
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,970
important to decide

151
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,030
the security of the communication

152
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel between two ble devices so</font>

153
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,318
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the i/o capabilities of</font>

154
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:50,719
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the devices you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can configure</font>

155

<font color="#CCCCCC">the type of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm that algorithm</font>

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,599
that needs to be used so in the case of

157
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,849
just works ether of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices would</font>

158
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:01,729
not have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> input-output capability or</font>

159
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:04,669
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a display of any</font>

160
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,500
sort so as the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggests the</font>

161
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,960
connection between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two devices just</font>

162
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,509
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is no user interaction</font>

163
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,758
required and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to numeric</font>

164
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,849
comparison one of the devices has a

165
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,669
display and also a yes or row button so

166
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:21,979
the user can look at the numeric value

167
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:25,190
displayed on the available in the face

168

169
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,710
numeric value matches on both devices he

170
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,190
can click yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come from the</font>

171
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,710

172
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,919

173
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,888
the divisor connecting to it is

174
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">acceptable to man the middle attacks and</font>

175
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:47,690

device<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a input/output capability</font>

177
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:53,389
like a keyboard or a display or a touch

178
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,310
screen etc and it also has a display to

179
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,550
look at the numeric value so you would

180
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually go ahead and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enter the pin and</font>

181
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,280

183
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,549
and then use ble for any further

184
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,630
communication so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lastly are not</font>

185

vulnerable from man-in-middle-attacks

186
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,699
but as we see in the latest<font color="#CCCCCC"> tides there</font>

187
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:22,400
might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just works is</font>

188
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:25,130
used so and let's take a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

189
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys used to communicate</font>

190
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,710
securely between two ble devices and

191
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,328
like we saw earlier that's a peripheral

192
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:38,478
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your client so the first step</font>

193
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:40,520
before devices start to exchange data

194
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,190
securely is setting out a pairing

195
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,740
request which includes the capabilities

196
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,990
that are supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the list of</font>

197
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,420
keys that they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use in the</font>

198
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,410
further communication so the pairing

199
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,819
request is sent out and the

200
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,189
peripheral if it supports all the

201
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,470
capabilities and if it agrees to all the

202
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:04,040
requirements imposed in the request it

203
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:07,430
sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the response back and that is</font>

204
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first key of interest the TK or</font>

205
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:14,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">temporary key so the TK is dependent on</font>

206
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:17,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the kind of pairing algorithm used that</font>

207
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,670
we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the previous slide and so in</font>

208
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,520
the case of just works the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value of TK</font>

209
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,310
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and when we use numeric</font>

210
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,910
comparison or pass key entry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font>

211
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,920
of TK is the pin itself and in the case

212
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,110
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of band communication the value</font>

213
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,939
of TK would be the data that is

214
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">exchanged using the outer bag channel</font>

215
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:41,120
and TK along with a random number from

216
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,760
slave or peripheral and a random<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

217
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,890
from master is used to derive our second

218
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,330
key of interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> also known as the</font>

219
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-term key or SEK so essa key is</font>

220
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,220
used to encrypt the channel temporarily

221
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,970
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to exchange the next set of</font>

keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are used for any communication</font>

223
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:08,270
later on so let's see water<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys</font>

224

<font color="#E5E5E5">further communication once the devices</font>

228
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,540
try to reconnect after this initial

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,400
pairing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> NT k is really important if</font>

230
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,260
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all this</font>

pairing process all over again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

232
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,780
time devices go out of range and come

233
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,340
back and connect to each other and ir k

234
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,310
comes into picture when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

235
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,040
enable privacy on your ble devices so

236
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:40,369
ble supports the use of random num

237
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,589
random addresses so but the problem

238
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,390
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you use random addresses at</font>

239
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,060
random intervals you will still need to

240
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:50,000
be connectable or you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

241
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">identified by devices you already trust</font>

242
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,150
that is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i RK or identity resolving</font>

243
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,560
key comes into picture so by the help of

244
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,930
it you can still<font color="#CCCCCC"> use random addresses</font>

245
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,650
and still be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to trusted</font>

246

248
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,300
used when two devices would like to

249
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,820
communicate over the unencrypted channel

250
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,640
but would still like to authenticate the

sender of the message you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> es</font>

252
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,530
harder to achieve the same so like we

253
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,800
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> ltk is used for any further</font>

254
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,540
communication here and to name a few

255
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,050
algorithms that are supported as of

256
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:35,650
today is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed head for key exchange and a</font>

257
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">is for encryption so to take a look at</font>

258
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,340
the support available for developers

259
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,410
looking to use ble capabilities in their

260
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:46,520
applications code blue tooth is

261
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,530
available on iOS and it's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

262
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,650
encapsulation of the Bluetooth stack we

263
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:54,350
saw earlier and the objects are

264
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:56,870
available for discovering managing or

265
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,240
connecting any peripheral<font color="#CCCCCC"> Central's etc</font>

266
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,180
and like you can see characteristic is

267
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,470
to describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that is exchanged</font>

268
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">between both the devices and for Android</font>

269
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:12,260
the support was introduced as part of

270
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,910
version 4 or 3 and 4 anybody willing to

271
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,460
enable bluetooth capabilities in their

272
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,020
applications you need to define the

Bluetooth and Bluetooth admin

274
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,329

for the purpose of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this presentation</font>

296
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:25,378
let's look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity trackers fitness</font>

297
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:28,050
monitors and such so usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font>

298
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,870
buy a variable it comes associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

299
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:33,300
a companion application on a smartphone

300
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,529
so this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an app on your Android</font>

301
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,779
or iOS iOS phone that you install then

302
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:42,300
you start provisioning your variable and

303
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,160
start using it I'd said so again

304
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,029
generally speaking the variable

305
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,240
interacts with the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ble or</font>

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,319
connect to other external peripherals so

308
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,748
this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a chest strap to</font>

you have taken again bluetooth low

used for communicating with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

314
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,870

325
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:38,069
actions such as generating dashboards

326
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:40,740
doing some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of analysis on your data</font>

331
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">course there are classes of variables</font>

332
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,550
that also directly connect to the cloud

333
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,250
without having to channel through the

334
00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:00,420
companion application smartwatches for

335
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,589
instance and before I dive into the the

336
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,709
weaknesses so I'll be focusing

337
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,689
exclusively on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> highlighted area here</font>

338
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,170
that's the communication between the

339
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:12,509
wearable and the companion application

340
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so if you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

341
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:17,459
transpires between the the wearable

342
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,019
device itself and the companion app so

343
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,309
there this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all actually a whole lot</font>

344
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,459
of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes back and forth</font>

345
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:27,420
but primarily the traffic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes from</font>

346
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:29,878
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone app to the variable is of two</font>

347
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,290
kinds so one of them is device and

348
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,779
settings related commands

349
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,569
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a new firmware update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

350
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,759
for your activity tracker it gets pushed

351
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,649
to this to the phone the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

352
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,709
application then pushes it to the device

353
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:45,240
right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that the phone</font>

354
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,430
app needs to put the device into a

355
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,339
receiving mode and generally this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

356
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,170
something like a boot mode or a recovery

357
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,930
partition would have you so there's a

358
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">command to do that in addition to that</font>

359
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,170
maybe you don't just don't like the name

360
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,759
of the device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is broadcasting so</font>

361
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,550
there may become has to change the

362
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,509
broadcast name of your variable and in

363
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,370
addition to that there are also

364
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,920
notifications right so some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

365
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,839
variables today can give a feedback to

366
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,219
you in the form of haptic it can vibrate

367
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,500
or if it has led it can blink the LED of

368
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,459
a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> color depending on whether</font>

369
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,279
you're getting a call where you're

getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a text or our Facebook update so</font>

371
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,579
all these notifications are also sent

372
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,069
from the companion<font color="#E5E5E5"> app to your variable</font>

373
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:28,170
device and in the other direction there

374
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,430
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a wealth of data in your in</font>

375
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,719

<font color="#E5E5E5">you and as well as your biometric data</font>

379
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,620
so that is your heart rate information

380
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:43,470
that is the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of calories</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

of sensors on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unavailable study</font>

383
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,250
right and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

384
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,260
new functionalities and use cases where

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use some of these devices to</font>

386
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,189
control applications running on your

387
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,589
phone so you can answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a call reject I</font>

388
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,019
call skip a track on the music

389
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:03,799
application playing on your phone and

390
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">also there are some weird worrying cases</font>

391
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">as well there's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true where you</font>

392
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,900
get a notification on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your variable but</font>

393
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:18,990
you bounce<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back to the companion</font>

394
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:20,669
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so getting closer so when the</font>

395
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,189
variable divided stocks to the companion

396
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:25,169
application so a few slides ago my

397
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,600
colleague actually described how Billy

398
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,340
security works how the various keys are

399
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,639
generated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he what keys you used</font>

400
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,990
to do what security operation but if you

401
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,070
have if you are a network attacker and

402
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,500
you are listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all the traffic</font>

403
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,908
going back and forth you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

404
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,330
like uber tooth for instance it's it's

405
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:43,980
one of our favorite tools you just get

406
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,159
the dump plug it into Wireshark and

407
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,660
analyze it it's all

408
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,640
encrypted it's all encrypted using the

409
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">long term key regardless of the panning</font>

410
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,290
mechanism that you choose so this

411
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,840
attacker essentially cannot get access

412
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:58,110
to any of the user personal data that is

413
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,639
going from the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the app or</font>

414
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,469
other they are not able to inject new

416
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:10,060

417
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:11,950
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> here lies the problem so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way the</font>

418
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">belly encryption works today especially</font>

419
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,840
in the smartphone platforms that are

420
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,959
really popular like iOS and Android is

421
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,699
that this this whole encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> ax is</font>

422
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,050
acting at the granularity of the phone

423
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,970
and not the app so this means if you

424
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,340
have an application<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same phone</font>

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:34,030
where your companion app resides and

426
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:37,090
that application is using the same

427
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:40,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">beauty stack and the services it can act</font>

428
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,879
as an insider<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which means the</font>

429
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,439
network attacker is still not able to

430
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">see anything everything is still fine</font>

431
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,330
but this particular malware application

437
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">line that we have so on Android and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iOS</font>

438
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:06,790
today you can subscribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the same</font>

439
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:09,580
services and the SD used a seam SDK to

440
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:12,100
get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the data using the ble</font>

441
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,980
characteristics as illegitimate app and

442
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,350
on Android this is fairly simple so all

443
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,900
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do declare those permissions</font>

444
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:22,060
on the screen out there and if you look

445
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the developer documentation today</font>

446
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,950
that's the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshot but it says</font>

447
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,780
the Bluetooth admin permission is

448
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,030
required to be able to discover and

449
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,500
connect to the devices and the other

450
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,500
ability is granted by this permission

451
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,950
should not be used good luck<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an</font>

452
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,560
allover application obey that and all

453
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,390
iOS are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these simple really well</font>

454
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,639
documented classes out there that you

455
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,090
can use lots of examples how to write an

456
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,910
application using bluetooth let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

457
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:55,449
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> examples so in our first</font>

458
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,040
example we have analyzed a class of

459
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,510
variable products commonly associated

460
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,300
with fitness

461
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:03,550
and these these wearable devices use

462
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,740
just ble not classic Bluetooth to

463
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,899
connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the companion phone</font>

464
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,340
application it's not public the source

465
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,660
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not available its proprietary</font>

466
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,189
but there's a lot of information out

467
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,320
there already which really helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in</font>

468
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,910
our research they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

469
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,189
these messages look like what are the

470
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,800
headers whether the data begins where it

471
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,330
ends and so on we wrote a really simple

472
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,399
malware application so remember all the

473
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,280
GATT description that car<font color="#CCCCCC"> gauges</font>

474
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,500
mentioned so all we did was write an

475
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,960
application that was scanning for GAD

476
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,270
characteristics do a rewrite on those

477
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:40,560
just dump<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and start analyzing what</font>

478
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:40,560
the dump is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you a quick demo</font>

479
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,840
alright so in this case we have the

480
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,380
legitimate app running in the background

481
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,270
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not show it here on the screen the</font>

482
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,170
window on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right is our malware</font>

483
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,610
application we connect to the device so

484
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,750
at this point the legitimate app is

485
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:19,429
connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fitness tracker as well</font>

486
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,680
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see on the screen now so the</font>

487
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,480
screen on the left is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lock ad for</font>

488
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,920
the malware application so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

489
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,720
are collecting logs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android and</font>

490
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,100
dumping them on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen and we are</font>

491
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,600
generating traffic using the variable

492
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,770
we're just spinning it in the hand it's

493
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:40,159
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are running and the</font>

494
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:42,950
data that you see there oops it went

495
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,150
ahead but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two lines that you</font>

496
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">can observe that's repeating over and</font>

497
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,230
over again so the first line really is

498
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,460
the hex dump it's just a dumb that we

499
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,380
are getting directly from the wearable

500
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,650
device when we are scanning and reading

501
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,030
those characteristics and after a bit

502
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we just stared at it for a few</font>

503
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes and then we realize that the</font>

504
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,910
actual step counts the heart rate the

505
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">calories are actually there in hex</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

506
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that log messages so we wrote a</font>

507
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,060
really simple parts are it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like five</font>

508
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,680
minutes of work to see to understand

509
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,940
what each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these values</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean and it</font>

510
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,540
turned out that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the steps</font>

511
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,400
on the calories and the heart rate and

512
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,020
to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happening in</font>

513
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,240
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> time now we are having both the</font>

514
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,830
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> run in parallel we are</font>

515
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,110
spinning the variable and then you can

516
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,669
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this just keep scrolling and</font>

517
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,540
both the applications are getting your

518
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,540
biometric data

519
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

520
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,299
the second class of variables that we

521
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:48,309
analyzed were more complex so in

522
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:50,889
addition to bluetooth and Billy they

523
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:53,500
also had Wi-Fi capabilities much richer

524
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:55,389
network stack so this actually

525
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,649
eliminates a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of threads that we're</font>

526
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:58,840
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that is</font>

527
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:01,059
associated with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> app being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

528
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,769
channel to connect to the cloud well

529
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,658
this actually protects a few so our

530
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:06,340
exact same malware application that we

531
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:10,570
ran to scan for the GAD characteristics

532
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:13,809
actually did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up anything the</font>

533
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:16,389
third one was a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more fun so this was</font>

534
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,549
a different wearable device as usual we

535
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:21,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">ran out malware application but well we</font>

536
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:22,658
didn't see anything we looked at the

537
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,158
legitimate app a little more try to

538
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:26,409
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on in it and</font>

539
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,309
it turned out that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had</font>

540
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:33,009
thought about security a little more so

541
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:35,678
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the connection plus initial</font>

542
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:38,289
setup they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in syndication so</font>

543
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,419
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the legitimate app had</font>

544
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:42,309
some sort of an authentication mechanism

545
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,620
to talk to the device before it started

546
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:47,500
sending data or receiving data from the

547
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,539
from the variable well it just took us

548
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,649
more time so what we did was we<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked</font>

549
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:52,539
at the legitimate I have tried to

550
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:54,879
understand how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works rewrote our</font>

551
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,889
malware application to mimic what the

552
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:58,330
legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> f was doing but we just</font>

553
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:01,719
stripped away the authentication on the

554
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,340
handshake parts of it we then waited<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

555
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,009
the legitimate app to connect to the

556
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,899
device establish an active session then

557
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:11,259
fired up the malware application and

558
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:17,289
then started sending packets and guess

559
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:19,440
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll show you a quick demo for</font>

560
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,440
that

561
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,340
so in this case we connect the

562
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:42,630
legitimate app first we scan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

563
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:45,000
device we connect to it the screen on

564
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,120
the left is the logs coming from the

565
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">many comments to Syria logs that you see</font>

566
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,510
so so in this case we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah so</font>

567
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,090
the device is connected to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> companion</font>

568
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,500
applications the legitimate app we look

569
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,600
at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the capabilities that the</font>

570
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,880
device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app has one of them is</font>

571
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:09,120
to reboot so we show a<font color="#E5E5E5"> command to reboot</font>

572
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the variable and we wait to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that the</font>

573
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:18,899
device reboots so far so good and now we

574
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:20,310
fire up the malware application so at

575
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point we're also in parallel</font>

576
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:25,710
waiting for the real application to

577
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:31,199
connect and once that is set up we issue

578
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:42,450
the exact same reboot command and the

579
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:44,660
wearable reboots right that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

580
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,660
demo

581
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> serious why should be</font>

582
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,590
really worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we get it</font>

583
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:01,299
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some of you are thinking well</font>

584
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,970
this requires a manual application on my

585
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,730
phone we are paranoid people by

586
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:10,870
profession that's never going to happen

587
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:13,179
true but I odeon variables are there

588
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:16,330
everywhere trace if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Play</font>

590
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:21,399

<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth and Billy based applications</font>

592
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:26,219
there right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I OT is the future</font>

593
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:29,320
billions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices 2050 blah blah but</font>

594
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,330
it's having said that so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

595
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,428
hard for for these application

596
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,110
repositories to identify a man where app

597
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,179
so like we discussed all they really

598
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:40,240
need is Bluetooth permissions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth</font>

599
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:43,419
and Bluetooth admin permissions and and

600
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,980
the risk may still be low you still need

601
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:47,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">a malware app on your phone in order to</font>

602
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,340
be able to do this and go undetected but

603
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:52,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact is high right so the</font>

604
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,399
variables are different from smartphones

605
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,960
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually on your body they</font>

606
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:58,600
get access to a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of personal</font>

607
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,190
information there are numerous anecdotes

608
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,990
and news articles to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

609
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,029
someone uploaded their fitness

610
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,820
information and someone else said oh

611
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:07,870
yeah maybe you are pregnant so so stuff

612
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,639
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that's that's really</font>

613
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">dangerous right song and confidentiality</font>

614
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:16,510
wise many of these sensors actually have

615
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">gps in them which means they get access</font>

616
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:22,179
to fine grain minute-by-minute

617
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,860
day-by-day month by month information on

618
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:25,870
where you are at what time of the day oh

619
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,120
that's super<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary you don't want anyone</font>

620
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,289
else to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that information</font>

621
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,539
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to the confidentiality</font>

622
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:33,039
aspects there is also the integrity

623
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:35,529
availability and the annoyance thing

624
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">where applications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this can fool</font>

638
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,360
in addition to this well if you're a

639
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,250
hot young started up trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

640
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,209
dent in the variable market there's

641
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you need to worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

642
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,040
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one bad incident that talks about</font>

643
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">how crappy your security is I can really</font>

644
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,899
hurt you this is also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> board risk here</font>

645
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,850
where it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy there is</font>

646
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,250
nothing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with your personal device</font>

647
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,469
itself it's really easy to spin up an

648
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app and throw it out there</font>

649
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:32,410
somewhere and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this can cause a mass</font>

650
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:35,200
infection of devices everywhere so what

651
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:41,380
do we suggest you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it after</font>

652
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:44,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chandler</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you so much so before we</font>

653
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:49,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">jump on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mitigations that we're</font>

654
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:51,510
gonna propose so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to clarify</font>

655
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,890
a few of the object few objectives and

656
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,470
non objectives and the assumptions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

657
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:59,679
we made before proposing these designs

658
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,929
so the objectives here is preventing any

659
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,690
malware application from sending a

660
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:06,880
commands like reboot<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn the factory</font>

661
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,500
reset all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands to available</font>

662
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,110
device without a proper authentication

663
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:15,700
and the other objective here is the

664
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:18,820
confidential information that the device

665
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:23,110
is capable of generating like activity

666
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:25,928
data or<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS data or any other data so we</font>

667
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,850
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent that information from a</font>

668
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:30,160
malware application that's running on

669
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:34,360
you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone where the alleged</font>

670
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:37,860
application is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also running and few few</font>

671
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,629
assumptions here are we assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

672
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,240
standard ble<font color="#CCCCCC"> pating has already happened</font>

673
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,790
and and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the out-of-the-box</font>

674
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,929
experience happens with the legit

675
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:53,170
application and the non objectives here

676
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:55,480
are like no we are rooted phone or the

677
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,860
jailbroken phones are out of scope since

678
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's there is no way that you can</font>

679
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect anything when there is a root</font>

680
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:04,350
access on a phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also any other</font>

681
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,710
vulnerabilities that can break<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

682
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:11,409
operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems sandbox model so the</font>

683
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,710
and the other assumption on objective

684
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,960
here is the rogue application or malware

685
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,480
application that's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attempt to</font>

686
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">appearing to the variable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one saw</font>

687
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> legit application is already paired</font>

688
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:26,440
and also we won't be dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

689
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,460
the man in the middle attack since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

690
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to cover in this</font>

691
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:37,030
talk and so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's an overview</font>

692
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our the mitigation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

693
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,580
proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so as you know that there</font>

694
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,500
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ble stack on the phone and the</font>

695
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,230
Bailey stack on the variable device<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

696
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">other pairing between them happens and</font>

697
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,370
then now there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one one</font>

698
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:53,770
communication channel between the

699
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:56,500
variable as well as the apps that's

700
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:59,620
running on the phone and you can see

701
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,720
here the variable the legit application

702
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,669
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as the rogue application on the</font>

703
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,340
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> ha or use the same communication</font>

704
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:09,610
channel to talk to the variable<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

705
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,959
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we protect this one like you</font>

706
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,939
know how do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have just the</font>

707
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">legit application that can talk to the</font>

708
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">variable device not the rogue</font>

709
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:20,410
application so we we say like they we

710
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,060
propose one more level of pairing from

711
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:25,470
just from the application to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

712
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:28,090
variable so that the alleged application

713
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,100
negotiates a separate key other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

714
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:34,179
what the kiss that caviar had mentioned

715
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:36,939
earlier it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a key that local to the</font>

716
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,800
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then using that key the</font>

717
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,740
variable as well as the application use

718
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,830
it for the secure communication and

719
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,220
there are few considerations or

720
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:49,870
depending on how the variable can be

721
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,820
really can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be configured on a variable</font>

722
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,370
device so that you know your variable is

723
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,700
capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talking to multiple phones at</font>

724
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time or just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one phone or</font>

725
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,110
multiple phones talking to your

726
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,889
variables one<font color="#E5E5E5"> variable so the all these</font>

727
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:09,219
considerations have helps helped us to

728
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:12,250
arrive at this design and this is the

729
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:16,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">simplest design that I we will be</font>

730
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:19,360
looking at since I hear the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple legit</font>

731
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:22,540
application on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone generates a</font>

732
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,240
random key which can be any any any

733
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,580
number or any random number and then

734
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,790
that which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchanged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the variable</font>

735
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,260
device so this this is happening after

736
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,750
the ble pairing us all

737
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,450
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the application the</font>

738
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,730
alleged application is talking to the

739
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,440
variable device for the first time and

740
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">now both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> variable as well as the</font>

741
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,350
application have the same key and then

742
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,270
they use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> key for the secure</font>

743
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,189
communication or to authenticate any

744
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:54,970
comments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application is sending</font>

745
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:59,440
to the variable<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how do like this is a</font>

746
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-to-one command now the extinctions</font>

747
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,060
of these designs could be like now let's

748
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,610
say like now if you have a say<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font>

749
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,440
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a user using multiple</font>

750
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:11,290
phones and you have one variable device

751
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,120
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to use the same key</font>

752
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,530
across multiple applications for the

753
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,840
secured communication because you

754
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:20,620
already established it up to device

755
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:25,179
pairing now here once when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you log into</font>

756
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:27,100
the application the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did here in in</font>

757
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,140
case if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have any user password</font>

758
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,409
available or anything you can your

759
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,110
application can request any pin a user

760
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:39,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up their own pin as part of the</font>

761
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:42,100
authentication and then they use a

762
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:45,420
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> kemah key exchange mechanism</font>

763
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:48,040
any key exchange mechanism here to

764
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:50,740
exchange a kiss between the variable and

765
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,450
now both application as well as a

766
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,130
variable has the same key then they can

767
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,820
begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> the secure communication with each</font>

768
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:59,380
other so now let's say now if you want

769
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use the same key that has been</font>

770
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,780
exchanged for the first time across the

771
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,940
other application running on a different

772
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,460
phone but for the same under the same

773
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,520
user account so now in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

774
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,899
since whenever there is a user account

775
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,030
available so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

776
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:20,350
connected to your application so we

777
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:23,290
upload the key and now the user on phone

778
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:26,409
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlock single in the same application</font>

779
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:28,690
and then enters<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same pin because</font>

780
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:31,389
since Lee a pin number was already

781
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,010
general selected by a user so user has

782
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,260
to enter the same pin so which will be

783
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,149
authenticated with decline with the back

784
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,370
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the back end would provide</font>

785
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:41,620
you the same key which can be used to

786
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:43,330
the execute communication so that you

787
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,159
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to perform any key</font>

788
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:50,918
exchange again on the

789
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:54,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">own too so now they design the next</font>

790
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:56,408
design is like know in case if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if</font>

791
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,660
you do as you can saw in the previous

792
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:00,880
design you are uploading the key in the

793
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:05,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">plain text and but you want to secure</font>

794
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:08,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that key as well now when the user log</font>

795
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,299
chain and then connects to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> variable</font>

796
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,900
and exchanges the key and now instead of

797
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:17,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">uploading it key in the plain text you</font>

798
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,839
can encrypt the key and incur upload the

799
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:22,420
encryption encrypted blob to the back

800
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,190
end so that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user is in</font>

801
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:28,660
complete control of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

802
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:31,180
the key to decrypt the encrypted blob so

803
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:34,210
now the user locks<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the application</font>

804
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,700
on phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and he uses the same</font>

805
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,880
account and then authenticates with the

806
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,859
cloud and then the cloud provides the

807
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:46,059
encrypted blob which will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> decrypted</font>

808
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:50,740
on the application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the key can</font>

809
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:56,289
be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the secure communication so</font>

810
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:57,939
I this is a universal solution did the

811
00:35:56,289 --> 00:36:00,670
reason why we call a universal solution

812
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,589
is like know if an operating systems

813
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,200
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application would run provides</font>

814
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:06,819
a solution that similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what we</font>

815
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">propose like application to device</font>

816
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:10,990
pairing in a ble service layer that they

817
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,899
provide for the application developers

818
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,819
then we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do not need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have any</font>

819
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,460
other design since it's a one solution

820
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:22,950
that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed across any number of</font>

821
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:28,440
applications that's running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the phone</font>

822
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:31,480
and as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the ble devices they</font>

823
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,289
can go out of range at any time and come

824
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,150
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and connect to the host application</font>

825
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:39,190
so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> no these are the three</font>

826
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:42,250
corner cases that always comes into play

827
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:44,950
whenever you have a key that needs to be

828
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,630
managed on the application side so there

829
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,730
is a chances of that the key might be

830
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:51,819
lost on either of the one of the party

831
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,319
so when when they do bluetooth when the

832
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:55,690
variable device goes out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

833
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:58,779
Bluetooth range and comes back in there

834
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,909
is a chances that the device can be

835
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:03,339
he said by the user or anything might

836
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:07,989
have happened and now when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

837
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:10,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the Bluetooth range the user can</font>

838
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:14,199
parry now the there is no key on the

839
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:15,939
variable device so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also there he has</font>

840
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,939
to go through the standard pairing

841
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:21,069
process but at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time the application</font>

842
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:23,439
doesn't exchange any key since it's

843
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:26,019
already exchanged the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now the</font>

844
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:27,308
user is pairing using a different way

845
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:29,258
like you know going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> settings</font>

846
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:32,259
application set in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth and then he</font>

847
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:34,479
is pairing from a different way at that

848
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:38,849
time there is a key mismatch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

849
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:41,828
happens and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with this and</font>

850
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:43,839
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is such a possibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

851
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:46,119
the phone application can be uninstalled

852
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,569
or reinstalled or the phone application

853
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:53,829
phone can be factory<font color="#CCCCCC"> reset and the keys</font>

854
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:57,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case will be lost and also how the</font>

855
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:59,469
rogue application on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone it can</font>

856
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,539
attempt to pair it to the variable

857
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:03,849
device after the legit application has

858
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:07,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">been paid so how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with these</font>

859
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:10,839
corner cases the simple solution that we

860
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:13,089
we came up with this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to propose a</font>

861
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:15,969
challenge response mechanism whenever

862
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:18,099
the key exchange happens so that

863
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:20,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">whenever the device goes out of range</font>

864
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:22,449
art comes back in range are in any any

865
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,549
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the communication begins</font>

866
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:27,849
when there is a disconnect between the

867
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:29,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone and the variable happens so the</font>

868
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:32,650
challenge response mechanism would fail

869
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:34,029
due to the key mismatch and in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

870
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,009
it's it's up to the application

871
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:38,289
developers to show appropriate error

872
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:41,229
messages to user to take an appropriate

873
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:43,839
action to wipe the variable device or

874
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:47,288
any any action that guy user can take

875
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:51,009
and let's say if the challenge response

876
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:53,529
mechanism is successful so that's when

877
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:57,669
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communication can begin</font>

878
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:59,650
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I the data that's coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

879
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:01,959
variable can be encrypted using any one

880
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,689
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> available algorithms like AES</font>

881
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:08,799
like it's completely variable dependent

882
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:10,538
and also the row commands are the the

883
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:12,069
commands that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application is capable</font>

884
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:14,229
of sending can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

885
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:16,959
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> H max so that you know the device</font>

886
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:19,390
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key that can only authentic</font>

887
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:20,979
eight and then perform execute those

888
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:24,538
commands upon the receiver<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

889
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:29,589
command from the any malware or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the raw</font>

890
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:33,009
legit application and let's see a demo

891
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:35,619
so the demo i'll be showing is for from

892
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:38,619
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> design flow one where the key is a</font>

893
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:42,339
key exchange happens and then how the

894
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:46,140
encrypted information cannot be seen by

895
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:46,140
the malware application

896
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,770
so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have two applications one is</font>

897
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,589
a legit application call and the other

898
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:16,870
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a malware application and when</font>

899
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the so now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is our legit</font>

900
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:22,630
application we call and as you can see

901
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,100
the device is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not connected and now it's</font>

902
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:29,260
pairing because this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> out-of-the-box</font>

903
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience and you you can see the</font>

904
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,910
device is connected so here the class of

905
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,370
variable that we are discussing for the

906
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,350
purpose of demo is the notifications is

907
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,759
now the whatever the notification that

908
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,190
the phone receives is sent to the

909
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,900
variable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the variable replace</font>

910
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,720
back the same notifications to the

911
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:50,110
application so here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see there is</font>

912
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,520
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> notification that's facebook Messenger</font>

913
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:56,040
notification that's coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

914
00:40:51,520 --> 00:41:01,000
variable to the legit application and

915
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:02,710
you can you can see the the notification

916
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,140
message is being shown in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mini</font>

917
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:15,430
console window inside the legit

918
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:17,890
application so now now let's now let's

919
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,960
launch the malware application and as

920
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,720
you can see the connected status of the

921
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,660
malware application is already connected

922
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,480
to the variable<font color="#E5E5E5"> because since the</font>

923
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">pairing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's using the same ble</font>

924
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,100
communication channel and now because

925
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,410
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legit application has already</font>

926
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,960
exchanged a key that as part of the

927
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,270
design flow one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I discussed so now</font>

928
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,430
all whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the communication that's</font>

929
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:45,250
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> on both the legit and the road</font>

930
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:48,339
application gas access and let's see how

931
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,830
the malware application says the

932
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:54,070
information that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from from the</font>

933
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:56,110
variable and as you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

934
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:59,020
here there is a notification that's

935
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:01,500
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the variable and the malware</font>

936
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,640
application is able to show the

937
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,350
notification but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's encrypted</font>

938
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,420
and the malware application does not

939
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,690
have a key which the alleged application

940
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,819
negotiated with the

941
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,250
variable so hence<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not able to</font>

942
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:14,779
decrypt but still the malware

943
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:18,579
application gets hold of the information

944
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:25,520
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it cannot read anything out of it</font>

945
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:27,410
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now let's see how this if you see</font>

946
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,970
on the legit application since the legit

947
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,509
application has the same key that the

948
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:34,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">variable has and it the legit</font>

949
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,609
application is able to decrypt the

950
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:49,460
message and display it in the console

951
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:52,670
console so so now let's go part so the

952
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:54,920
summary here is as as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss that D</font>

953
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,109
there needs to be a malware application

954
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,839
running on a phone and which is not as

955
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:02,450
straight for me there is no way that I

956
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,319
mean it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very it needs a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

957
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,910
to have a malware application running on

958
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:10,190
phone with the because since it's a

959
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">user's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control user has to cover user to</font>

960
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,839
be controlling the phone and so that

961
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:18,290
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we categorize this</font>

962
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:20,540
as a medium risk but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of this</font>

963
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:23,329
particular vulnerability is high since

964
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the malware application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones get on the</font>

965
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:27,710
phone has whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

966
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:31,578
sensitive information like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know your</font>

967
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:33,380
GPS data or skin to skin temperature or

968
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:35,150
your activity data in any anything

969
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever the variable is capable of</font>

970
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:41,930
generating and the impact of this

971
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,540
information vulnerability becomes even

972
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,690
more severe when it when we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

973
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:50,839
this variables in security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

974
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:53,560
finance spaces like if if you're using

975
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:56,720
an Apple watch to auto unlock your

976
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,940
macbook and and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using a</font>

977
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,578
payment system from your variable so

978
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,680
that's that that's one of the that's why

979
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:09,609
it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we categorize that as a</font>

980
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:12,200
severe impact and this vulnerability is

981
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:14,900
cannot be fixed just by protecting the

982
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:18,020
network traffic and network attackers

983
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,550
since this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a this is not</font>

984
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,220
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network attacker can</font>

985
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,940
do

986
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:26,040
and on top of that like you know there

987
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">is no universal solution as we design</font>

988
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:32,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pier of few slides so the hence</font>

989
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:35,069
there is a lot of work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the OEMs as</font>

990
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:38,820
well as the app developers has to put in

991
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:43,170
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order to get this vulnerability</font>

992
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:45,300
fixed so if an operating system has this

993
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:48,570
capability of<font color="#E5E5E5"> app to device bearing then</font>

994
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,400
there is no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for any other any like</font>

995
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:55,080
OEM sort developers to put in extra

996
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,420
effort to fix this problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

997
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,830
give a shout-out or colleagues<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allison I</font>

998
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:03,420
know who helped us to put in those

999
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:09,000
slides uh sorry put in those little

1000
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:11,690
videos and and thank you everyone and we

1001
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,690
are open for questions

1002
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:31,250
I think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute or</font>

1003
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:33,529
two see any questions yes um well maybe

1004
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,080
so this is because so<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I said some</font>

1005
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:38,630
variables can connect to external

1006
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,880
peripherals like a chest rapper like a

1007
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,830
pedometer but those tags are very

1008
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,790
limited right so the Richard stack is

1009
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,620
really between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the variable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1010
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,710
companion phone and there are

1011
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:50,450
restrictions that that limit how many

1012
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:52,790
devices that available<font color="#E5E5E5"> can already</font>

1013
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:55,069
connect to so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was can the</font>

1014
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:59,680
can one variable bounce information to

1015
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:59,680
