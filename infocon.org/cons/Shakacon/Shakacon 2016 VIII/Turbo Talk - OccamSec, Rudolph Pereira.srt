1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:06,930
so hello everyone I hope everyone's

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,639
enjoying the lunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> and obviously the</font>

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,340
conference there's been some really good

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,590
really good talks so I don't want to

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,929
take up too much of your time these are

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">some basically this is a talk that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,490
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection of thoughts and</font>

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,669
reflections on on information security

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,909
some of which you've probably heard of a

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of during this these talks in</font>

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,790
this conference and some are just other

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,480
reflections on on information security

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:38,989
so Who am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> um yes variously an old man</font>

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,640
yelling at a cloud and some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

15
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:43,709
I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing security for quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">while in various roles offensive</font>

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,300
defensive would worked at a number of

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">different kinds of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> institutions so</font>

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,660
educational financial and now I'm doing

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,690
information security consulting so i

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,300
would i would say i spend my working

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,190
hours asterisks implementing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Occam sex</font>

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,170
world domination plans obviously we

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,590
don't have any world domination plans or

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,720
do we but also as anyone will know who

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,340
works in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of industry it does</font>

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,408
take up a lot of your time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,229
probably almost all my time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love doing</font>

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:21,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know i do spend the</font>

30
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:24,150
majority of my time awake doing this so

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,830
let's let's do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of talking</font>

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,360
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> security as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font>

33
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,630
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be a</font>

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,049
huge technical expose on you know some

35
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,070
in-depth exploitation method instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

36
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,470
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,350
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know plug</font>

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,869
Occam's take a little bit but really in

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,579
the context of our approach so some

40
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,799
useful nuggets and slightly pointed

41
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,990
commentary some people might not

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,299
appreciate that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think sometimes</font>

43
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,570
you need some you know some hard love if

44
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,790
you're regarding infosec and i would say

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,079
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of you here you've been</font>

46
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,270
working in the industry for quite a

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,639
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> and probably heard most of these</font>

48
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but you know we do keep seeing</font>

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,049
same kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mistakes so in a sense</font>

50
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,179
it's probably worth taking a little bit

51
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,170
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different perspective and looking</font>

52
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,819
at things a little differently and

53
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,140
saying maybe stepping back and saying

54
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,450
hey maybe why

55
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,399
are we trying to do these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things as</font>

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,019
Einstein said doing the same thing

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,900
repeatedly and expecting different

58
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,880
results is the definition of insanity so

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,500
maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should you know reflect on what</font>

60
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,060
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing if it makes you you know</font>

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,420
think a little bit while you're having

62
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,340
your lunch then all the better so I'm

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to the talk is kind of structured</font>

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,310
as kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a few adages and then a</font>

65
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,980
few reflections on those so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

66
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,319
obviously a model of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain and I</font>

67
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,149
would say we would say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font>

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">your best asset you know we can talk</font>

69
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,920
about user training and all that kind of

70
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,680
stuff but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an analyst or a</font>

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,079
developer or a researcher obviously this

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,769
is really the asset that is most

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,890
valuable that you have obviously there

74
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:04,890
are many many details in information

75
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,679
security and the devil is in the details

76
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,988
but this at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this part of this talk I'm</font>

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,040
kind of trying to say at a higher level

78
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,239
yes you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,220
details but you also need those

80
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,800
fundamentals you need to be kind of

81
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,900
taking the right approach so yeah if you

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't use logic reasoning</font>

83
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,160
your brain common sense then then you're

84
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,840
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doom from the start so added one</font>

85
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,420
this is you know a reflection on having

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,190
your cake and eating it and again I'm

87
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure everyone has heard these kinds of</font>

88
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">things you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's cheap this fast</font>

89
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,310
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're secure and you can pick any</font>

90
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,680
two and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the 8020 rule</font>

91
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,950
so once you know you can do eighty

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,750
percent fairly easily and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then once you</font>

93
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,730
try to get to that last twenty percent

94
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,790
then then that's when you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

95
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,410
to get to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions around is it</font>

96
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,109
valuable to reach that last twenty

97
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,329
percent so<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when I'm talking about</font>

98
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,709
you know for particular products for

99
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,000
particular solutions here and I'll go

100
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">into that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more but that's</font>

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,230
what i would say adage one is so keep

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,170
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind keep these adages in mind</font>

103
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,600
as we go through this adage<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards say</font>

104
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,429
is is basically a reflection on the you

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,530
know modern threat landscape if you want

106
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,798
to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that so if your organization</font>

107
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,320
has anything of value and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd imagine</font>

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,959
most organizations do otherwise i'm not

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they're the reason</font>

110
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,300
for existence is then you fit into one

111
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,400
or more of those cat

112
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">is right most people I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,609
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know threat actors</font>

114
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,409
have persistence threat actors if you

115
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,240
have any value have either been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

116
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,069
network or are currently are in your

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,050
network or will be in your network

118
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,550
fairly soon and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably something</font>

119
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that comes and goes depending on those</font>

120
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,940
those you know throughout active groups

121
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,068
and what they're trying to try to get

122
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,379
out of you your organization in or<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

123
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:55,099
organizations or all of the above so

124
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:58,460
that's what we'd say adage to is at age

125
00:04:55,099 --> 00:05:01,219
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is you know simple</font>

126
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,680
things are easier to get right than

127
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:07,669
complex things so if you have a really

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">complex product it's much more likely to</font>

129
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:15,229
both have a you know a larger set of

130
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,020
bugs and a larger attack surface as you

131
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:19,789
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smaller some proportion we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

132
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,039
know exactly how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> calculate that right</font>

133
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:25,460
now but some proportion of those bugs

134
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,229
will be security relevant bugs so you

135
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,299
know again<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahkam sec we like to keep</font>

136
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,460
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple i would say that simple</font>

137
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,500
things product securities can security

138
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,818
controls are easier to get right than

139
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,029
complex things now let's let's talk a

140
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:45,770
little bit about the consequences<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

141
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:47,419
corollaries of these things so most of

142
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,318
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about money</font>

143
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,000
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are talking about</font>

144
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,830
organizations with assets that have

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,110
value and it's all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> money really in</font>

146
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,779
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of discounting</font>

147
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,699
those threat actors that have slightly

148
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:04,879
different motivations ideological

149
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:07,849
motivations that kind of thing they

150
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,460
obviously do exist but I would say the

151
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,199
small the small proportion of of your

152
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,560
total kind of set of attackers these

153
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,930
days and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately I think it's easy to</font>

154
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,629
say okay well these guys have a

155
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,020
different you know sense of freedom or a

156
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,879
different sense of morals and we don't

157
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,210
quite understand why they're doing it

158
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:32,029
this so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really about money but</font>

159
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think governments and groups will</font>

160
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:38,899
probably leverage those people with

161
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:40,260
those sets of morals and ideologies to

162
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,320
essentially effect

163
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,330
I'm kind of the same kinds of goals so

164
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,270
you know and it is probably about money

165
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,370
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in those cases certainly</font>

166
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,109
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> information we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking</font>

167
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,440
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guys here that you know</font>

168
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,590
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter for in these in these things</font>

169
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,360
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so they they basically this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

170
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,909
basically a reflection on the fact that

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,740
we know modern attackers operate as

172
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,270
businesses I mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font>

173
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,550
know the digital underground if you want

174
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,900
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that term but just keep these</font>

175
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,240
things in mind so consequence

176
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,039
consequences of those adages are that

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,200
you know the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are making trying</font>

178
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,030
to make money<font color="#E5E5E5"> off you your information</font>

179
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,340
your assets whatever your organization

180
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,130
has they make the same investments in

181
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,440
the same cool tools you do right so just

182
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,740
as easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can buy you know a cool</font>

183
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,600
product a cool a box<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

184
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,250
your network they can easily do the same

185
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,140
thing and obviously develop

186
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,580
countermeasures against that and

187
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,860
workarounds and all that kind of stuff

188
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,859
as well as look at those products and

189
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,540
analyze and fine you know zero days and

190
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,130
things like that they also have

191
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">short-term lot the short and long term</font>

192
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,930
goals so you know sometimes they may be

193
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,940
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set of information</font>

194
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,850
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that's that's the campaign</font>

195
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,260
that they're going for some time so many

196
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,270
long-term goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to maintain</font>

197
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,860
persistence in your network because they

198
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,599
think you know you are about you have

199
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,790
valuable assets that they want to expect

200
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,640
exel<font color="#E5E5E5"> trait for a long period of time and</font>

201
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,920
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not stupid nor are they general</font>

202
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,070
Zod's general zod being the guy you know

203
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,510
food well in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I'm using that as</font>

204
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,849
an analogy obviously a very you know

205
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">super smart super</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> God that is able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

206
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,780
infiltrate your networks and do all this

207
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,700
kind of stuff so neither under

208
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,390
underestimate or overestimate your

209
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:27,539
attackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably the thing to take</font>

210
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:30,840
take way around this and the thing is

211
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,380
though they do hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> often have a</font>

212
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,510
bigger downside I'm saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> incense</font>

213
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,789
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well ultimately there are laws</font>

214
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,729
that hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they can be</font>

215
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,890
prosecuted<font color="#CCCCCC"> under and and systems were</font>

216
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,650
whereby<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll all be made to go away</font>

217
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,699
so that is their downside as much as we

218
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,840
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know the attackers</font>

219
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,190
advantage operating in certain

220
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,320
jurisdictions they still altar

221
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:02,440
we have that I mean you know people are

222
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:04,090
after them essentially so<font color="#CCCCCC"> coral</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

223
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,640
lambs to the slaughter I would call it

224
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">so just again keeping this in mind this</font>

225
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,220
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the adages that we were talking</font>

226
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,020
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are two types of</font>

227
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,130
organizations in the world those who

228
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,620
know they've been hacked and those who

229
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:18,610
are blissfully ignorant i would say and

230
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,650
obviously being here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're hopefully in</font>

231
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the group that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks you know</font>

232
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,160
they have been hacked and they're going

233
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be prepared for it as opposed to</font>

234
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,689
those are a blissfully ignorant which

235
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:33,010
probably are not any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys here I</font>

236
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:35,110
hope so<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing's perfect is number two</font>

237
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,140
one hundred percent security doesn't

238
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,940
exist you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the</font>

239
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,640
one of the earlier talks was talking

240
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,830
about how you know people want that

241
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you know I press</font>

242
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,580
the button<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm secure that obviously</font>

243
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,230
doesn't exist and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's an</font>

244
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,220
important enough point that it bears

245
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,720
reiterating so yeah so you know adage

246
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,790
number three and Occam's razor<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahkam</font>

247
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,820
sick again right so we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

248
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,250
things simple I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> also say suspect</font>

249
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,840
vendors who say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise if</font>

250
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,670
someone is trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell you that just</font>

251
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,070
question that a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say how</font>

252
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,550
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this when it's basically</font>

253
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,080
impossible right and don't use them i

254
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,910
would say if if they keep saying that

255
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,520
making those claims that essentially are

256
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,740
unsubstantiated<font color="#E5E5E5"> unsubstantiated will</font>

257
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,530
even and if you have people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

258
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,120
for you that have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mindset they</font>

259
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,860
probably shouldn't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing security I</font>

260
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,510
mean you know that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not how</font>

261
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,790
security work so if they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

262
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:36,819
sell that just keep that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind yeah so</font>

263
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:40,719
if you don't do testing then that guys

264
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,060
will test you for free i would say adage

265
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,130
number three so yeah you know everyone's

266
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,160
hacked or getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat or has been hacked</font>

267
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:50,110
will be hot and it's important for you

268
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,110
to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you either you do it</font>

269
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,960
in advance of the attackers or it will

270
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">be done to you I mean that's just you</font>

271
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,720
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of play if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will so</font>

272
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,189
fairly is an option it's just a

273
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,290
consequence of the fact that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

274
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,030
nothing is one hundred percent and you

275
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,050
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have sufficient controls</font>

276
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,880
or sufficient

277
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,859
you know controls that can help you in

278
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,200
every single situation and obviously

279
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,300
attackers are intelligent and they will

280
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,339
attempt to locate and bypass those

281
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,339
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

282
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,380
plan B what do you do then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

283
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:25,720
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye up and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have</font>

284
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,279
backups and all that kind of stuff and

285
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,350
potentially something like cyber

286
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,250
insurance if if that's what you feel

287
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,110
comfortable with so yeah as I was just

288
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,399
saying if you do not have an IR plan you

289
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,660
soon will because this is the

290
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,240
consequence of the fact that you will

291
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably be hot if your attackers aren't</font>

292
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,670
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now you just don't</font>

293
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,410
realize it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have an IR plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

294
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,839
so we've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had some witty guidelines</font>

295
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,029
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just quickly run through</font>

296
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,839
some examples observations and handy

297
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:58,209
hints everyone talks or lots of people

298
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,190
talk about threat Intel and data and all

299
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:02,380
this kind of stuff just keep these

300
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,390
things in mind I mean you can talk about

301
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know a million events that you're</font>

302
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:10,240
you know event correlation system can in

303
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:12,219
just a second or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot it's really not</font>

304
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,829
that useful they're still kind of

305
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,420
ultimately bits of noise you need to

306
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:18,160
actually process that to get information

307
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then once you have useful</font>

308
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,199
information that is what becomes

309
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,180
intelligence and we try to sell down

310
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,640
towards the you know the lower end of

311
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,040
that your organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> can enter can act</font>

312
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,260
on intelligence and data events I mean

313
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,270
it's like in some cases they're

314
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,800
completely useless in other<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases it</font>

315
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,959
needs to be a lot of processing around

316
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,579
that how much should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spin you know</font>

317
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,229
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some contention around</font>

318
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:43,510
whether this is possible for some

319
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,730
organizations I would say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

320
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,310
should try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this see how much your</font>

321
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,320
assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> are worth and then say okay well</font>

322
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,359
what is the you know average around

323
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,520
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend for that and spend a</font>

324
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,930
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that so you know</font>

325
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,540
there's the old adage which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font>

326
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,189
actually added here about you don't need

327
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,750
to you know outrun the bear you just

328
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,420
need to outrun the other guys that the

329
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">bearers after so keep on the forefront</font>

330
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,399
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and that's why i say spend a</font>

331
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,199
little bit more so there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mcnamara</font>

332
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,120
fallacy which is basically you know you

333
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:16,089
measure things that are easy and then

334
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,040
you optimize for those things just keep

335
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,120
this in mind right everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks a lot</font>

336
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,099
about certifications and stands that

337
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,020
nothing I mean it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just testing</font>

338
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,430
a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should question whether</font>

339
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,710
this is actually correlated with

340
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,689
improved security so you know

341
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,490
certifications test who's good at tests

342
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's test who understands the</font>

343
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,950
standard and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd say analogies you</font>

344
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,540
know often fatal fall over you know

345
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,610
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of like all cyber</font>

346
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,069
weapons and cyber war and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

347
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,170
thing it's like sometimes that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

348
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,760
sometimes it gets the point across but

349
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,719
there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit too much</font>

350
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,670
loss in the use of those analogies what

351
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,730
are you aiming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be I would say you</font>

352
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,640
know just what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you aiming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be now</font>

353
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">i put i put the asterisks in solving</font>

354
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,250
world hunger because it doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

355
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,130
be a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that most people are</font>

356
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,320
interested in doing anymore everyone

357
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,750
wants to be you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

358
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,730
seals and everything else imma keep in

359
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,990
mind you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have boot camps and</font>

360
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">court-martials and you aren't killing</font>

361
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,670
people so it's really what you want to

362
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,690
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for and trying to be as an</font>

363
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,979
organization again economics<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad guys</font>

364
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,220
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about all of these things</font>

365
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,920
maturity pci compliance it's like what

366
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,230
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want and</font>

367
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do i get it and it obviously does a</font>

368
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,250
you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost trade-off there if it</font>

369
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">just costs too much to get then they'll</font>

370
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,900
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the next attack or you you</font>

371
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,580
know in some cases will get more

372
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,620
advanced attackers trying to come back

373
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,240
for it so there is the art of the con

374
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,589
bad guys know your weaknesses and try to

375
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,420
exploit them otherwise they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

376
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:53,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">businesses basically what they're trying</font>

377
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:56,150
to do so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be you</font>

378
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,170
know talked about in terms of in terms

379
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,760
of the con in terms of I<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose you</font>

380
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,250
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide a slate of hat sleight of</font>

381
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,810
hand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get things out of you</font>

382
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,000
that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even realize are being</font>

383
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:15,069
gotten but I just want to demonstrate

384
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,070
this little video hopefully it works

385
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:37,540
some of you may have seen this before

386
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:37,540
some of you not I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's cool</font>

387
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:55,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully everyone saw that I mean it</font>

388
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:57,949
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not see the hidden you</font>

389
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,710
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect of that their attention</font>

390
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously as it starts as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its titled you</font>

391
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,240
know selective attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you don't</font>

392
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,220
you don't see you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the guy in</font>

393
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> suit gorilla suit coming across</font>

394
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,540
generally right because you're following

395
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ball and again attackers will</font>

396
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,410
understand that they understand

397
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:22,580
motivations and psychology that's kind

398
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:24,980
of their business<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's pretty</font>

399
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,840
much it you can still win<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember this</font>

400
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,730
you can you just have to watch out for

401
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,980
the gorilla watch out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

402
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,900
other things as well as I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

403
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,250
his adages and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you should be</font>

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,380
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the back</font>

405
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,540
your mind not trying to repeat the same

406
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,760
mistakes over and over again not trying

407
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be conned by you know even you know</font>

themselves who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font>

00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,650
these kinds of attacks and you know

inundate you with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> events that</font>
