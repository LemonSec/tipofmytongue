1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,189
orgasms to add

2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:10,780
quick introduction to our next speaker
it's a real privilege an honor to

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,790
to host of here Chaka Khan six a

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,490
for those either don't know josh is the
director I love research

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,750
very sorry an active on armies also the
author I love the Android

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,829
packing handbook right his eyes budget

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,919
is that right now close enough and he's
a %ah he's donated to to the raffle

8
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:30,770
tomorrow evening

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,460
arm so without any further ado

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,460
just a drink hitting Jason

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,940
so I can

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,199
skip supplies now says chase also the
introduce me

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,900
here's a quick outline a what I'm gonna
cover today a

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,839
let's jump right and so me is as he said
I work at a oh come on

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,850
and lead author andrew hacker's handbook
there's actually five other authors

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,759
with me so not alone by any means

17
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:08,310
although was you know difficult for all
of us

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,240
so also found in the droid sec research
group it's just a

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,130
basically bunch guys I hang out entire
city started with about five guys and I

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,740
think right now it's almost a hundred
people in the channel

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,750
on freenode some time with you guys may
know me from previous work at for sign

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,830
or a rapid seven

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,100
where I was fairly that's what developer
for about a year

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,789
maybe your help so my focus

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,040
for a long time has been Export
Development

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,450
learning about your abilities how they
work other can be leveraged for remote

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,670
code execution are or privilege
escalation

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,869
mostly memory corruption focused all
I've done a lot of other things as well

29
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,740
that the motivation this talk is to

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,548
to help people overcome what I see is
the biggest problem doing research on

31
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,549
Android security

32
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:58,360
a and that is fragmentation so what do I
mean about that

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,140
what caused said so how many people in
here have an Android phone

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,299
it's pretty good

35
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,640
is it only the only device are also I
call backup

36
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,738
some people have all right so a

37
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,599
to read and read what youve you'll see
is if everyone brought their devices

38
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,709
together in this room

39
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,299
input a mall next to each other you see
they're all wildly different looking

40
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,540
you know you start playing with each one
you go to the home screen or go to the

41
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,168
menu

42
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:29,629
or drop down the status bar they're all
different so there's just tons

43
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,040
differences between all these devices
some devices

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,569
you know they have a hardware changes
completely sold

45
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,708
up a good example is the Samsung Galaxy
s3 or s4 s5

46
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,819
a in the US to have several different
versions or

47
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,969
worldwide have sold their herds and
usually like

48
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:50,388
a good example is the the s3 for spread

49
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:53,870
is a totally different model number and
even uses a totally different processor

50
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,450
than the global international s3 so
power

51
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,078
even within a single thing that's
marketed with one name you may have

52
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,309
completely different things on the
inside other things were mentioned

53
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:09,989
the look and feel the code changes that
are underneath their our to support

54
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,659
features that are custom to certainly am
those things

55
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,519
all change things as well and they
coulda affect the attack surface

56
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,059
or in a just they could even add a back
door which has been seen in some cases

57
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:26,198
development scattered too so that adds
to it

58
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,719
we're talking about Williams making
changes so cool kinda makes

59
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,608
Android itself and they keep it all
closed behind closed doors and

60
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,219
the release and I'm guess today's a good
to start a Google i/o so I'm

61
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,519
assuming soon maybe today tomorrow will
be a new version rendered

62
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,349
be released it's kind of like 12 year
they do this big unveiling of all the

63
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,108
work they've done

64
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:48,939
a development wised it's not

65
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:53,969
you know doesn't need to be pushed out
on a patch a

66
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,279
so after they do their thing that make
kind of like give it to know %um

67
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,309
civilians make all the changes then so

68
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:02,978
it's kinda like a a tree of life if you
will for Android development

69
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,109
through all these processes people can
enter introduce new

70
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:09,260
security vulnerabilities and so on a

71
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,349
for another thing here's an effective
the fragmentation missus

72
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,698
one of the guys who works on the
Qualcomm product security team

73
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,000
those guys are amazing there probably
the best in the

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,790
in the in the field as far as security
goes and

75
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,910
and they are both proactive and reactive
they're the only ones that i've seen.

76
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,720
publishing advisories are the only ones

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,590
allocating CB East they're the only ones
giving credit to researchers

78
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,239
to the point where they've even given
credit to researchers who like basically

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,410
just wrote in exploiting release into
the wild

80
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,620
which is pretty nice I to hear this one
guy he saying

81
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,650
you know me fixed a bug here's the
advisory

82
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,179
and then this one other Draytek members
cedric

83
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,870
he says you know do you know what's
horrible to this and he basically says

84
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,300
well we only know

85
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,900
kinda what trees are our code bases are
vulnerable we have no idea who's used

86
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,719
those

87
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,290
or what devices those might be on so
this is an example above

88
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,940
how fragmentation can can buy security
up

89
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,710
a the other affect our you know research
time is multiplied so if you're doing an

90
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,340
audit on a particular device

91
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,510
you may spend several weeks doing that

92
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,340
and back to the matter is is you have to
focus on one device because

93
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,320
if you try to focus on all then you know

94
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,440
so I'm so if you try to focus on more
than one didn't you just have to keep

95
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,340
retesting

96
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,190
a lot of things right so soviet you test
like a certain attend as a certain thing

97
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,080
I one phone

98
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,090
it may not do it on another phone so you
have to kinda do that and it

99
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,820
and it makes it really time consuming as
I mentioned it

100
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,860
the attack surface changes so physical
devices release or to become require

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,190
and then andrew hacker's handbook I also
wrote that you know

102
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,810
I'll I'd I recommend physical devices
for secure research anyway because

103
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,980
the emulators are typically very slow to
use

104
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,700
I'll person x86 emulator which is
actually pretty fast

105
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,200
but if you're sticking to our you want
to do things with armed

106
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,900
it's very slow but also for the hardware
reason

107
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,460
so so what I came up with well was
writing a book this kind of like a

108
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,930
distraction so I can keep my motivation
and keep myself

109
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,110
not necessarily focused but at least a
my morale up

110
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,620
was to work on a side project of
collecting Android device bring together

111
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,990
so a this talk is mainly about that

112
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,350
that contraption created that it's both

113
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,080
it's both the hardware and a a software
project so it's not just a

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,770
something you can download its and now
we can do a quick demo record

115
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,820
see if I can do it from this little
people

116
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,240
cadet so

117
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,630
this this little script this part of the
stuff I really stand

118
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,300
basically takes a hour a little database
and I rehash

119
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,570
format and and goes through and runs a
TV devices checks for all the serial

120
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,050
numbers that are there

121
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,990
up for devices are present and then

122
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,630
creates a little database which is used
by these other scripts

123
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,540
which so they're only query the devices
which are actually there one query

124
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,560
you know every device that I've ever
seen or have ever had at my house

125
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,990
and so he right I can run one command
real quick and get a list of all the

126
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,750
kernel versions for all the devices that
are currently plugged in

127
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,810
this is kinda like a quick demo love
what

128
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,560
its cable up to use this tool now go
into more details about what else is

129
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,630
possible

130
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,750
here this will give you the all the
Android versions for all the devices are

131
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,350
plugged in as well with their

132
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,480
model names in I'll but keys they work
not with and all that stuff so

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,530
that's quick demo what tools can do

134
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,460
so a existing solutions I'll I started
this

135
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,049
being inspired by ap Kudo I hope I said
their name wrong on our

136
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,910
alright I guess her head so they inspire
me this picture is up their setup

137
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,440
I was like wow that looks really cool I
really like how are those in

138
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,810
and the they started their business
basically because

139
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,470
they wanted to help OM's an app
developers test their applications

140
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,810
across all these devices

141
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,580
on not necessarily for obscurity point
of view but more

142
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,770
on the app level and more you know
because different devices you have

143
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,450
devoured were different devices have

144
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,680
like Harbor our supper modifications
they have different screen sizes you

145
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,169
know if you can imagine if you're trying
to make an app

146
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,109
has some buttons and you've got some
auto layout did you may wanna see it a

147
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,210
whole wide range of devices so you know
if your buttons are in the wrong place

148
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,968
or getting rapped funny or something
like that

149
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,389
and since then I've also found test
droid app slack

150
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:41,558
and others amarin test cloud although
examine test cloud

151
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:46,209
got acquired by someone and I I think
they're focuses on exactly and retired

152
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:49,508
a little bit different so they're
Android capabilities will

153
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,329
getting less attention these numbers in
parentheses are a roughly the number of

154
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:54,769
devices that they have

155
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,959
available if you want to use their stuff

156
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,128
but the the problem I am have with their
stuff is

157
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:04,939
it is really ap focused and I

158
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:08,730
yet they don't I can I help you do
security stuff

159
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,309
I don't think maybe there will be open
to it but you know there's legality

160
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:16,199
concerns like those are their devices
are okay for you to go over them all

161
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:19,889
on you know routing is it's really an
important first step if you're going to

162
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,939
do security research on Android

163
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:26,449
like if you BB shell into stock Android
device

164
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:30,089
and you try to list like the data
directory or something to see if there's

165
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:30,730
any

166
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,910
directories are needed to have better
missions or something like that

167
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,589
you can even do that unless you're into
device so

168
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,959
so you need for to do research and and
that makes it difficult to use

169
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,189
he's disguises clout for it are these
guys

170
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:47,480
and recalled her how everyone however
they want to market

171
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,360
a the other thing is is that okay for
you to go and pull information like I

172
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,610
just pulled from my

173
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,970
device cluster knows it okay to run
commands to pull all the information

174
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,860
from the devices or is it okay

175
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,240
for example to list what in the SD card
directory like are they gonna be mad

176
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,470
about that

177
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,999
on fizzle physical proximity
requirements or nothing

178
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:11,529
basically like that some things that you
have to do you have touched the device

179
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,769
you know you have to like especially
with security there Ben Vaughn abilities

180
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:15,259
where

181
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:18,660
in order to exploit them you have to do
something run a nap a run a script

182
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,529
and then you know a drag down the menu
and then

183
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,809
turn wifi on and turn it back off its
but something that's a little bit more

184
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,209
difficult to do when you're nowhere near
the device

185
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:32,258
although some things can be automated
and and finally like optic fail right if

186
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,579
you're if you're looking for

187
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,149
your table abilities are looking for
unknown tax there against Android

188
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:37,990
devices

189
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,079
you really don't want to just kinda be
running those on that somebody else

190
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,680
a systems you know you don't want to
leave your your exploits

191
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,800
playing littered across all these
different devices

192
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,920
at so the answer I came up with to do
this was just to build my own

193
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,649
so the next section here is about
building anybody have any questions at

194
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,439
this point

195
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:59,550
alright cool you feel free to raise your
hand and stop me anywhere

196
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,998
anywhere along the way it right will do
a longer

197
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:07,050
curate and with the period we have so
the original design was pretty simple

198
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,910
and crude

199
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,910
I was trying to give me a big ass her
and plug lot

200
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,110
device into as many as I could the

201
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,449
it so I i I made my initial purchase it
was a $75 dollar

202
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:21,550
pub called The mondo I was like yes this
is going to be awesome

203
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,709
so I had told devices want to use to use
and I don't use anymore they're all

204
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,518
kinda been box is unlikely to get those
I'll

205
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,639
so I get 'em allow I'll the Creekside
now

206
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,889
the slide about the things in green are
things I recommend in

207
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:38,279
the slides will be released later these
are the ways of getting devices I

208
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,220
recommend

209
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,759
the stuff in red not so lateral

210
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,559
hot my opinion and the yellow is kinda
like well

211
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,540
you know it's more money but sometimes
you have to like if you want to do

212
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,610
research on a galaxy s five-year gotta
find some for the part 1

213
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,360
doesn't want it anymore like right away
or you have to pay full price for

214
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,220
so sometimes it happens but by and large
most the device and I got

215
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,249
I got through eBay or Facebook
rochelle's or

216
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:08,209
asking friends I'll or even you know the

217
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,739
in this is our date actually the rising
more GI Best Buy's actually fifty

218
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,769
dollars right now I think so

219
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:16,790
up to these people all help me by giving
me devices

220
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:23,790
and a give me advice stuff let's give
these guys around the clock

221
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,889
all wonderful people that were very
helpful and generous

222
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,009
you'll see Google's in there thank you

223
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,819
so there's the model up if you guys
never seen them onto a bit

224
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,860
it's pretty intense it's got USB ports
along the side on them some on the top

225
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,939
M&A there's to rosa buttons which are
actually Harbor switches for each

226
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:48,149
poor a the downside is did

227
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,209
internally this however is is a it's
actually like five hubs daisy chained

228
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,498
together so when you plug it in you see
this like hierarchy love this

229
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:59,720
crazy thing you're like all that's weird

230
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,490
I thought it was cute 28 per home like
you know sidekick Kato reports but that

231
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,670
doesn't work that way

232
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,899
and you know that your to these are the
devices that I had

233
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,869
hooked up you can see at the top there's
a droid heiress and then there's a

234
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:12,709
couple uva

235
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,040
and her TV sticks a couple and droid 1

236
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,498
the OG Droid and then the a couple other
devices I think their droid incredible

237
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,999
so as time went on the other 0.7 0.8 I
got some dough boards

238
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:29,470
are the top right can see the pandaboard
him in the top left you can see order

239
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,480
board

240
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,290
although all along the way getting more
USB cables and down on the right corner

241
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,490
i think thats the

242
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,529
Galaxy Nexus and then the next seven

243
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,809
2012 there in the gray in the case

244
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:45,319
to keep going out to keep building more
in alright somewhere book

245
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:48,670
or somewhere devices rights more book or
smart devices

246
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,679
and so this is kinda like a

247
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,980
you know believe three months in and
I've got a bunch more devices from e-bay

248
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,309
and at this point I really start to
realize the benefits of doing this

249
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:02,719
project because at this point I can
start running commands

250
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,329
across these devices from a wide variety
of volumes

251
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:10,569
seeing what similar what's different
seeing

252
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:13,579
you know what similar between devices

253
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:16,599
had the same system-on-chip but maybe
from different

254
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,149
so I start to really see a lot of the
different groupings UHV

255
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:23,829
up code base is behind a for hardware

256
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,689
so this is a kind of a big jump up

257
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:30,759
there's a lot of writing going on in
this place and a lot of ordering to

258
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,459
myself

259
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:36,388
for so here in July 2 30 to 39 took this
picture

260
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:39,480
just before our eyes did a presentation
at rekon

261
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,540
which is this weekend this year and

262
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,569
said the show's just I got a lot more
devices basically

263
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,998
its you know the pot get bigger their
I'll

264
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:54,369
it yes your team under i got really that
real recently sorry a

265
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:58,850
for so disaster strikes at this point

266
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,139
you can see this is still a minor hub
for disaster strikes tomato harvest

267
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,689
dead what happened was the d'amato have

268
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:09,899
it comes to the fore and power supply
and if you do the math

269
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,220
typical Android device or USB device
takes about half a nap

270
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,779
at twenty a port that you know forty
naps

271
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,600
so 4 and 14 amps become available power
distribution problem here

272
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
and eventually the the 1 reports are
losing how

273
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,619
losing port they just disappeared like
%uh pride

274
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:31,999
actually had it I'm not gonna blame them
on how best early but one of those

275
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,730
Android USB sticks just died

276
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,309
a and if things were is dying at this
point a

277
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,019
I got out a few herbs after asking
around you can see in the bottom right

278
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:42,949
corner there's

279
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:46,910
least three black ops and at this point
all I had was

280
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,079
plugged in was you know gingerbread

281
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,689
& Ice Cream Sandwich divisive are sorry
a Ice Cream Sandwich and jelly bean like

282
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:55,879
the the phones on the left side are all
like

283
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,230
gingerbread in below and there's kinda
stacked up nearly all the way

284
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,879
so it display I'm scrambling to get what
I have together and I'll have these

285
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,379
three up so that's why I don't have a
mobile again at this point

286
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,160
so that I was like well you know that if
I'm gonna rebuilders

287
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,160
I don't wanna have the same problems I
had my bottom on the hob like being

288
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
disappointed by

289
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,569
the hardware so I start doing research
to figure out what what are the

290
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,279
limitations a USB

291
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,339
I'll you know what is really gonna make
this kind a future-proof

292
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,339
for ever write like how can I solve this
for ever and service all India

293
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,040
to get by because it died so I asked her
on Twitter and I was like you know how

294
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,899
many

295
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:36,089
I how can I hit .227 portraying the

296
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:41,230
after reading that there is a 127 poor
max on and I get some responses like

297
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,009
why would you want to do that or a do
you need to be able to still talk to

298
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:45,459
them

299
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:48,699
like or do you just want to pretend like
you have water twice and was I'm like no

300
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:51,459
I really need 127 devices

301
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,508
so often tells me he's he also has done
a bunch research with USB and a little

302
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:56,459
bit on Android

303
00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:00,738
with USB it will be the most I've seen
and I C seven which makes perfect sense

304
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:03,439
right you've got this model habits a
chain of homes

305
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,990
then it makes sense is the most all
seven as well so you're like oh I see

306
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,150
you know it's got basically some seven

307
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,050
port how by season there was some wiring
like okay will that make sense

308
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,359
he says you need at least 21 have I said
I'm I haven't gotten

309
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,240
a aggressive enough to like trying to
build my own personal mantra hope

310
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,630
although i've seen

311
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,520
some similar projects are the big point
space so I did some math

312
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,340
asserted run some diagrams to come come
up with the maximum that I could have

313
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,639
a given these two limitations have night
a

314
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,930
7 only dept from the rooftop cleaner
home and also a maximum 127 right I want

315
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,450
to have the least amount hubs with the
most part I'm gonna devices

316
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,560
a and so I came up with this design in
this is this is a realistic maximum

317
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,440
Android

318
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,940
cluster are over 108 devices

319
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,080
in it you have her try seven pretty
quickly with only 19 homes in this case

320
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,620
although there are several unusable
parts directly god knows what happens

321
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,350
when you plug something into one of
those ports because it will be under

322
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,030
over the 127

323
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,629
I could crash a colonel who knows have
tried it I i don't have a 108 devices at

324
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,720
this point

325
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,420
so will get into what actually looks
like right now

326
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,420
to built of abode of recommendations
from Charlie and Sergei

327
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,630
an awesome and a lot of people are
trapped here and there like publicly in

328
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,850
also privately and basically what I came
up with

329
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,909
was the best care that was the stealing
some port hub switch

330
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,000
you know as you saw before seven porches
the max I see anyway so

331
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,960
was kinda makes sense and then they also
give you two amp power supply which is

332
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,970
enough to supply power for also imports

333
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,790
police pretty a lot closer than 14 you
know versus for

334
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,909
a the other thing that Charlie told me
use this for his in a few causing

335
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,550
he said the two studies have to have
south where power control for you can

336
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,960
brought a program

337
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,840
until to turn off a poor an alternate
power off until you runner

338
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,090
the same program in shape to turn it
back on so

339
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,189
that's all a really nice thing to have
especially if things get wonky

340
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,980
devices fall of the the cluster whatever
you can just automatically kinda

341
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,610
cycle the poor and have come back I also
what time the micro USB cable some long

342
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,620
some short

343
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,120
recommend if you're gonna get a gonna
build something like this

344
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,229
are going to at least get 16 for cable
the extension

345
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,850
chords work OK but they're not great
than actual sex what court seems to work

346
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,929
a lot better

347
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,970
and this is important because if you
wanna

348
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,060
you know do something we're gonna have
to interact directly with a device that

349
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
you're gonna wanna have

350
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,840
up to cable coming to your desk and in
my case like I have this table behind me

351
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,850
my desk in my desk is here so I don't
wanna keep getting up I'm mature

352
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,620
going to touch things and then going
back to type things government texting

353
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,530
so that the 6-foot cord comes in real
handy for that to the current apologies

354
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,050
this

355
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,440
avoid got 7 Hobbs plugged in one
hardcore

356
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,810
the root hub is there you know you only
get so many parts with your help to

357
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,370
clear a PC

358
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,840
so I've got one back just one how to get
there which is actually really

359
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,560
convenient to you because if I don't
want to

360
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,970
cluster there it's kinda like the one
court and all everything is selfish in

361
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,830
you know keeps running but I just can't
talk so I can just get that one chord

362
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,840
right now is support about $49 USD USB
devices and you could see when I render

363
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,220
the the Recon fix crypt there's only 45
plugged in at this point

364
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,070
and that's because somewhere like spread
around a different place to my house

365
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,610
like so

366
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,729
to wake up and be like all our for or
whatever

367
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,230
to another issue becomes apparent after
I start looking this up right so

368
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,660
you remember like everything was in
disarray I'm like okay well I've gotta

369
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,100
like now I've got a solution for USB
sort

370
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,199
let's build this thing back to what it
was get everything plugged in again

371
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,220
and I run into this problem so these are
the wall works to come

372
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,770
with these USB hubs Anna the

373
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,820
you would like a center to absolute
power distribution isn't a problem but

374
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,629
the size of them CTO liberal

375
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,790
and that maybe I could find a different
different power strip

376
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,500
has more space but I didn't think that
was a great idea either

377
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,560
so I went and actually did another
project where

378
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,220
I found some something on a bit going
minor form where this guy

379
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,480
and I I can visit the link at this point
but a

380
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,170
he was building something that would
cabling system that would plug into the

381
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,930
a n/a TX power supply and the idea was
it

382
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,050
to use that to run like a sick miners
twitter-like

383
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,930
they look like iPods but all they do is
krakow in a crank out hashes

384
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,160
on so he made this and I was like well
that's great I love to do that and I was

385
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,230
thinking about trying to get him to do
it for me but I was like I don't know

386
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,440
who this guy is in

387
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,980
I don't know what he's gonna want and
it'll be more fun to do it myself anyway

388
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,390
I

389
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,680
a in a former job before I got into
security actually

390
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,550
was doing robotics engineering and and
programming so

391
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,460
so I do a lot of cabling work there and
so I it was like kind of a blast from

392
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,260
the past and

393
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,070
also like when you're writing a book it
really helps to have something to do

394
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,159
with your hands you know like a nice
distraction

395
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,760
so I already have a check sparse playing
around I bought molex character's

396
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,820
appearance

397
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,980
the the barrel chords from digikey all
the information that you need to find

398
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,300
this stuff is right here

399
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,300
a so I ordered them to sell my own so
here's the cable

400
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,490
these it took me about two hours to put
together all the cables I needed for

401
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,130
this

402
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,280
I'm sure you can make a better cable a

403
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,810
I made a whole like private entities i
think thats

404
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,320
yep time attendees and I still have
couple

405
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,629
sitting around but a the whole point of
this was to connect to the

406
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,350
power supply and into the hub solar
power all the hub cities

407
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,919
and that means I'll anyone outlet in the
wall for

408
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,480
for all the help so here's what it looks
like all put together

409
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sure there's a more efficient way to
do this like I said because power

410
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
distribution I don't think it's
necessary to have all those mods

411
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,840
connectors rather could just be one
looks connector with a bunch of splicing

412
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,270
of about the important thing to keep in
mind here is that the power supply

413
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,700
needs to have a good level of
operational support on the Bible

414
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,890
rail which one is used for USB hubs in
this particular power supplies only 350

415
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,280
watt power supply

416
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,399
I think it does you're 25 or 35 amps on
the 50 trail so it's

417
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,010
its more than so

418
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,190
at this point I'm to Kenmore to the
future and I don't have

419
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,860
alternate devices but what happens if I
do have water in a device weapons by

420
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,389
wanna go and hit 127 or what happens if
I want to go

421
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,090
a and have like you know three hundred
like these other guys like I could to

422
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,970
help

423
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,200
and so so many ideas I came up with
those was I'm

424
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,790
227 limit and the 7

425
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,500
distance from the Republic think it
applies only to the to the USB host

426
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,360
adapter so

427
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,110
you could add more USB host adapters but
at some point in your machine you've

428
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,090
been around a PCI slot

429
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,290
so the other idea I came up with a with
a friend and I i think this is actually

430
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,270
really ideal

431
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,690
is to use some small machine like a a
Raspberry Pi

432
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,730
or I don't really love advocate at very

433
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,610
at Raspberry Pi but something a little
more powerful echoed right or something

434
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,979
you just plug all the USB into that and
then diplomatic protocol over that

435
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,980
over TCPIP which allow you to do in on a
limited scale

436
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,530
I'll haven't implemented this yet put it
on the agenda at some point hopefully if

437
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,500
I get smart devices or motivate me to do

438
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,100
so are the other thing is running out a
physical space as you can see

439
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,300
well as you can see here the table is
getting quite full and missus

440
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,990
this is you know a three foot by six
foot table or something like that

441
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,390
in a in a fourteen by 10-foot room so
starts to get pretty ridiculous pretty

442
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,540
quickly

443
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,659
another idea I had was maybe the power
powered phones without batteries

444
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,190
because the batteries can be so
reliability I don't know how many guys

445
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,920
have seen

446
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,600
lithium-ion battery that's not very
happy but a typically spew gas and start

447
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,649
on fire

448
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,790
so I don't want to have to males in my
office especially when I'm not there

449
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,570
so this is the result after I did the
redesign after I did the cabling and put

450
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,879
everything together

451
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,240
and then only a I think this is maybe
about six months later I got some more

452
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,170
devices and this is what it looks like

453
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,950
roughly right now although I just sold
my house so I had a tear it all down and

454
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,820
that really sucks but I had to put all
back together with shock even more

455
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,620
so now it's not quite like this but it's
the same roughly the same number of

456
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,879
devices

457
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,160
so now about the tools up

458
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,150
so when I started this a who obviously
had some tools and

459
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,660
the other guys to do this stuff must
have some tools as well but as far as I

460
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,920
could tell nobody was giving any those
tools I'll

461
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,080
so I decided to go ahead and just write
something real quick

462
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,790
I'm most the time when I was doing
direct research on an Android device

463
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,240
just a single device

464
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,760
going commando really run mostly was a
TB

465
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,879
a and also you know I would have beat
busybox on the device

466
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,440
to to bridge the gap between kinda the
vanilla Android experience

467
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,510
from a shell and the more traditional
UNIX experience you get on a leash

468
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,400
machine so no tools exist to and what I
did was I put together

469
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,430
the scripts and they're just through
scripts are nothing amazing

470
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,970
but but they do help time and they help
me

471
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,290
provisioned devices quickly so if I get
a new device to plug it in and run a

472
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,570
couple commands

473
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,240
and then it's there it and most
importantly I think

474
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,930
is it mattered let you manage devices by
human friendly names so if we go over

475
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,710
here

476
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,860
to the window again and we do a TB

477
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,990
devices

478
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,330
room I can type

479
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,439
alright a reason frozen now sucks

480
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,910
but if it's the for the other thing know
it's the

481
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,740
assisting okay

482
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,080
art so if we do a TV devices

483
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,010
you'll see this is what it looks like
typically when you're doing that and

484
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,950
that's not very human family alright

485
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:58,270
like you don't want to go the I wanna
talk to device 354 13 1247 be very you

486
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,129
know I like that snack at work

487
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,670
on that's a lot of frustration so I
think most importantly what that does is

488
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,860
it it let you

489
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,020
give human friendly names to it so you
can say that that

490
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,060
crazy serial number is actually like the
sgs3 or something then you just type

491
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,889
sgs3

492
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,510
if you want to know if this just three
is vulnerable to something more so on

493
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,820
also handles transit devices like I
mentioned before with the the separate

494
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,960
databases 1 Nick

495
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,110
is created from what exactly their to to
talk to

496
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,500
you know I like to play with my wife's
phone occasionally but she definitely

497
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:29,750
wants

498
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,080
had with her so sometimes Saia can you
bring your phone down on you to test

499
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,139
something and then should bring it down

500
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,290
and I can quickly make that part the
cost

501
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:44,110
to any other big big thing is that you
let you do

502
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,669
any cash that you can think about a
meeting against more than one device

503
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,160
I'll so the only requirements related be
binary and Ruby

504
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,330
is I've only tested on UNIX although a
theoretically it may work on other

505
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,340
things

506
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,949
as a want us to run Linux at like I said
the script really just perhaps a TB

507
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,490
so the usage is very much like a TB in
fact there's a nm do script it's

508
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,650
basically just

509
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,130
that's basically just ATB but for each
device

510
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,310
a simple and and also I recommend

511
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:21,470
dispatch primate ATB by to fall on
Android device appeared to be shell and

512
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,670
it'll put you in the root directory

513
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,610
I and also there's one other annoying
thing where

514
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,740
um does you familiar with the UNIX
terminal you get when you log into your

515
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,320
ex machina

516
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,590
has rows and columns attribute to it and
the Android

517
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,370
AB 20 it doesn't pass that information
to the device so if you have like a big

518
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,100
terminal

519
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,949
and you baby into a device a run like be
I it's only going to use like this tiny

520
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,180
little space in the window

521
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,720
and then also any type long commands it
wraps all funny so

522
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,750
this passionate II link here actually
does

523
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,270
pastor the the the rows and columns into
the

524
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,550
AB session which is much more much nicer

525
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,210
and also will put you into day local
temp which is a

526
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,270
directory everyone well shell user can
write to

527
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,379
on Android devices on all Android
devices

528
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,740
so it does those two things it's really
helpful independent busybox

529
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,200
a busybox like I mentioned

530
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,500
really help solve the the gap issue
between the two

531
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,240
type stuff that the the tools I and
radar

532
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,760
of unlimited many devices don't even
have the great command which is

533
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,520
a you know what does go to commands for
somebody doing security research

534
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,400
especially on a shell

535
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,800
I'll so the best busy Buchbinder I found
out there

536
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,399
at this actually came up when I was
writing a book I was like man someone

537
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,980
needs to make great busybox

538
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,040
binary one that doesn't have a lot of
crap problems cuz there was one that was

539
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,730
out there

540
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,270
and it was pretty good but it was linked
against eulogy instead over

541
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,010
instead of the and realty and so you'd
you do a last dash

542
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,390
L or something to see the users and
groups and they were just cooper's

543
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,190
numbers they would come up with a nice
names that were given to them

544
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,310
and there were a bunch rather silly
issues with it as well and so

545
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,800
I put it on my list I'm gonna do this
and then shortly before I started doing

546
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,980
the stalker put this talk together

547
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,080
a for it was like a year we just as busy
box buyer for me because that's where

548
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,500
the things that I like to do

549
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,600
having the 100 cluster unlike you I just
sent me whatever long as I trust you are

550
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,219
as long as

551
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,920
I looked at it looks good I'll just
going to run it for you tell you what

552
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,840
happened

553
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,189
and so he's like tested and tell you I
have I'm like I will doesn't work on

554
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,630
you know 2.1 devices and older or
something but

555
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,010
but it when he was talking to me about
what his goal is making this buyers like

556
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,460
ours

557
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,590
perfect this is exactly what I wanted to
do you know thank you knows what will

558
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,780
you put this up somewhere so that I can
link people do it and they can use it

559
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,639
you should def so that link will take
you to that

560
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,040
supporting nato this is sort of a little
bit nervous I know but it's also really

561
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,129
important

562
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,240
and along with the the 45 devices and
having them live and accessible at all

563
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
times

564
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,990
I've also got like I think 121 gigabytes

565
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,210
stock rom for all these devices this
allows you to like

566
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,650
do a complete factory store screw
everything up or

567
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:13,320
it allows you to do offline analysis as
well so you can

568
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,439
kinda explode the firmware image and
then pull a certain binary out if you

569
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,140
need that to extract officer or even
pulled Carlisle

570
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,220
and the stuff you can do without the the
100 custer itself so

571
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,330
this is kinda like a not only a
tangential

572
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,530
saying you can use for research but it's
also

573
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,020
you know something that's very
complimentary to having an Android or

574
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,080
droid army

575
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,590
you know just in case likes he swears by
having

576
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,309
stock from where you are the first
person to the device comes out is like

577
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:44,960
who's got a stock rom that I can start
playing

578
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,510
and I'll do a lot of you know sort of
line else scrape

579
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:54,000
done a lot over to so source code ESPN
the worst peach echo is kinda like

580
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,430
what those things if you're setting up
to 200 research I recommend you get that

581
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,870
like

582
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,209
right away early start right away cuz
you can take quite a while to to pull it

583
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,210
down

584
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,790
two-out I'll about 28 25 gigabytes or
something like that source code

585
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,559
it could be includes all binary
toolchain which is the one today

586
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,290
that most everyone uses to build their
Android systems I'll

587
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,690
includes a base or throw lender devices
includes exact code for the

588
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,850
Nexus devices so if you have a Nexus
device and you

589
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,070
and do you know they fully support you
doing this so you just pull the thing

590
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,740
you run for like a few commands to tell
which device you're dealing with and

591
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,610
then you can build one and it's pretty
much binary compatible with what you

592
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,199
already have

593
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,260
out as a out the from the factory images
under

594
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,309
cool and cool site and so that's really
nice especially if you just want symbols

595
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:44,139
for a particular thing you can just
build it

596
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,590
and then you have the symbols that
actually matter

597
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,530
but I would recommend that you don't try
to put for binaries with symbols onto

598
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,899
the device because they don't really fit
very well

599
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,510
the the WebKit library alone that was

600
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,780
something like seven hundred and fifty
megabytes if you build it was symbols

601
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,750
was like twelve people who tell so and
use the symbols on your host machine

602
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,080
for debugging but don't put them onto
the device

603
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,780
a ppl releases to are great for Skoda
Linux kernel GPL so

604
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,300
everyone who creates an Android device
based on Linux kernel have to release

605
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,600
their kernel source code if they don't

606
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,199
you know you can make a big stink about
it and get lawyers on a min stuff in it

607
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,200
they live in Chile hopefully do it

608
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,240
I'll there's a much more information on
supporting data and previous

609
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,730
presentations are done but also in the
book

610
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,250
so let's look at some other stuff that
you can do and I'll Terry

611
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,000
used to keyboard this time mister cool
guy

612
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,590
so I mention system-on-chip being
important I'll

613
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,990
so I'm command will just run into a
shell command on every device

614
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:54,230
and it 21 means to do one line right so

615
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,400
so for example if you want the
permissions dot means all devices so

616
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,480
dusty dot is all devices

617
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,670
the one means to do it like this where
put prefixes the line with

618
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,210
the name of the device and then shows
you the information

619
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,309
a if you don't do the one then you

620
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:14,860
then you get something more like a this
thing right here

621
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,440
were print device and then a blank line
and stuff

622
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,470
a so I'm almost always using 1d
measurement that

623
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:29,469
the fall so I'll see here so we can see
which devices are rooted here

624
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:33,868
I'll looks like there are some that I
have averted because I had to tear it

625
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:36,740
all down put it back together again

626
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:40,379
looks like the not cross the one looks
like that we lost her when I upgraded it

627
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,839
to the ladies room rhetoric

628
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,149
boo so this can take a little while

629
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:50,750
sup another thing I've identified and I
wanna try to do is is kind of

630
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,020
thread this out and an instead of doing
it serial

631
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,530
because your cellular devices that are
slower

632
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,690
it would be nice to issue the command
and then you know not have to sit there

633
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,100
a way for it to respond

634
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,410
while I can go on to other devices and
then have the result come back whenever

635
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,240
it's ready

636
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,580
this at my mouse cursor moving all pope

637
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,540
I don't think so so what else

638
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,670
for system-on-chip is another good one
we can we can

639
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:27,030
like a run there's also this one and BV
this one runs busybox is a shell command

640
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,900
so these are all just optimized for less
typing to get more auto

641
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,150
you know the command to the busybox

642
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,450
we can look at the platform

643
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,730
Minister block platform

644
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,830
and this one will want to do without the
the one

645
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,500
well wanna go ahead and go into their

646
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,430
so this one is if you look at it I think
we could do the one actually was 21

647
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:02,940
swim or compressed so just by looking in
this directory can see the different

648
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,150
devices and what

649
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,820
chipset they're based on you can see the
ones with MS and those are Qualcomm

650
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,940
devices

651
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,350
we'll see once with s3 see that Samsung
action of you can see on map

652
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,880
and and these are written this is a
really nice sorta grouping to look at

653
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,020
cuz the curls are split

654
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,009
based on a system-on-chip so if you have
a call come device then you have a call

655
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,900
girl

656
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,910
if you have a nomad to I 70 mccur and
these are actually completely separated

657
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,410
even in Google's source code
repositories

658
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,710
so I'll and more right likes

659
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,119
because the Qualcomm colonel comes from
goal.com

660
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,400
directly and then goes to Google and I'm
cool release so

661
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,070
on that's the one for anomaly to that to
the system

662
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,960
about where the source code goes further
develop happens

663
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,380
so we did a TV user privileges and we
did a we did

664
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,060
system-on-chip and we did rich status

665
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,390
so another thing we can do is we can
check for

666
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:06,240
vulnerable block devices are wonderful

667
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,720
devices based on exposed driver and
points

668
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,069
traction of man is one of those driver
and points

669
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,760
see the the dye 9300 has the same point
and also the

670
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,960
sph-d700 which is the

671
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,680
sgs2 on Sprint so only these two devices
have it all the other devices don't have

672
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,089
it

673
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,080
its really awesome to be able to the R
rating code:

674
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,710
it's a will there's this driver I wonder
if any these Android devices use it

675
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,080
and then you can get the result
basically this quickly

676
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,630
a other things you can do with your
little bit harder to demo lie

677
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,050
but when I probably won't do that is
escorts or compare devices

678
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,410
their processes that are running their
file systems

679
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,660
you know you might find one device has

680
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,890
sent you a binary the other doesn't or
might have a

681
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,040
directory in a subdirectory flight data
that has

682
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,860
it scare permissions whereas another one
doesn't or even

683
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,150
they will really point out like system
applications that are pre-installed

684
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,050
demand special privileges and so those
those getting standout really

685
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:13,290
really a lot when you start different
things especially with proper processes

686
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:13,660
to

687
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,740
like any services that oh and ad on top
of the panel and Raiders will pop out

688
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,950
really quickly when you

689
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,299
start looking at that same was in its
group tone is Chris wall social services

690
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,000
because they're

691
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,380
down if they obviously have to be
started at some point and boot-up times

692
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,130
a good time to do that

693
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:35,010
on you can you can def keyfile so
different applications manifest

694
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,520
you could pull information on their see
what keyser sign with

695
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,860
or the platform dot XML were also

696
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,330
show you some other information there's
plenty more things I mean a

697
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,140
anything you can think of that is on all
devices but might be different this

698
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,118
great too

699
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,390
to serve look at and to see what is
different that

700
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,310
platform to XML files actually like the
permissions that are defined by

701
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,490
the build that that devices

702
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,310
and rebuild so if if somebody for
example has a %uh

703
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,750
actor permission for a camera or
something like that and another one

704
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,150
doesn't then you'll be able to

705
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,590
to see that pretty quickly up

706
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:16,560
one final note on comparing devices
comparing like OEM devices to a Nexus

707
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,049
device on a similar

708
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,350
sort of generation is is really nice
thing to do

709
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,029
it points out serve all the
modifications that might have been made

710
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,420
along the way

711
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,750
so other tasks I mean we can definitely
like install an app really easily

712
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,380
that's like super easy if I have a nap
see if I have a nap

713
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,880
see if we have a case now a super
handsome

714
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,880
in subdirectories all I don't know how
to install those Bubble Guppies

715
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,839
I so we can do it quickly the right to
the command would just be like 12

716
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,910
Wendy like this and then install

717
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:00,770
but every PK I guess we can install the
company's that small store

718
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:06,700
will be faster sorry no idea at all go
and installers of Bubble Guppies ap

719
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,799
it takes a while though cuz this one has
to actually push to do pushing all the

720
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,440
way up and then do the install

721
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,780
to this will take a little bit longer
than a lot of others or test

722
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,570
in New so it in the process of doing a
disk this army is pushing

723
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,210
and installing it's part of the ADB

724
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,869
command but we can also like for example

725
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:29,890
push the she will have some exploiters

726
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,250
up

727
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,350
working exploits come on

728
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,690
iraqi you can do it

729
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,359
so I can run where these old export

730
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,390
think so I should have had an exploit
sitting here somewhere

731
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:55,390
say maybe it's Andy other directory
what's good victory

732
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,450
try to remember I put the other
directory

733
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:06,520
maybe it's in here

734
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,610
yeah

735
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:13,000
that disclose ok student

736
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,740
and I spell wrong all spilling

737
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,819
wrong up

738
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:28,820
okay sorry guys

739
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,100
alright where is it I'll yes that makes
perfect sense

740
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,799
ago

741
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,190
areas are you ever go

742
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,430
ago the should work sorry do recon
forgiveness when this gonna separate

743
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:53,020
suffer set up here you can see the
biotechs missing that was battery is

744
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,170
really bloated and scary so I took it
out

745
00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:00,720
set aside for a while so we can do and
do you want the dot

746
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,600
push we can put this file and a local
temple all devices

747
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,810
that's pretty nice so it doesn't take
that long

748
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:14,890
should be done in a second and as we see
here we can also

749
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,220
test exploits up 10 on the pulling files

750
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,290
this one requires a little bit special
handling and that you have to have

751
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,950
to buy specific directories to pull into
knows just kinda represent

752
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,899
the root directory of each device and
you can see here

753
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,120
have two devices which are similar
devices and I just polled like

754
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,000
some binary offer there something
lecture which one so if we do them

755
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,790
command

756
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,890
dish 1d dark and then run data local

757
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,049
temp I'll go back temp

758
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:52,920
TV 2013 sixty to you hope this is a good

759
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,880
good one see what happens when yep

760
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,040
so this one inch is going to try to
reach one and if it reads it

761
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:05,740
then it will just print your ID was
earlier equal 0 so this is a a nice

762
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,459
waited

763
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,760
just test exploits pretty quickly the
next week and take a little while

764
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,680
because a

765
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,290
if if the device is chilly breeze jelly
bean or newer

766
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,330
ill have this medication called the
message to restrict

767
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,710
and a that means that it can actually
read

768
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,730
the kernel symbols

769
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:26,780
or any that sort of information real
quickly so this one

770
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,440
actually had to leap tall girl into
account that information in memory

771
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,960
so I can take a little while to run a
newer devices but will

772
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,710
willa a turnaround it will go to back to
the other window

773
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:43,160
so another thing that's really nice
about

774
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,649
these tools is you can run

775
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,530
with the subs are things so you can say
like an bb1 the

776
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,530
you can put like Mako

777
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,830
and hammerhead or something like that
and you can just see you

778
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,250
you know what r one commands on only a
subset a

779
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,830
something I want to do soon is kinda
like tree artificial groupings

780
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:07,009
we can say like running command all
Qualcomm devices or run a command

781
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,330
on all devices to have a 3-4 kernel or
something like that

782
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,640
a so there's

783
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,730
you can offer run scripts on on on these
things for this one

784
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:23,210
finished are now the G one crashed for
some reason a

785
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,280
so this this horrible really affect 4.0
or later devices anyway so

786
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,410
it's not really make much sense to run a
g1

787
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:34,069
you can run scripts as well

788
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:37,700
and I'm not sure if I have this set up
right now

789
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,779
because I did have to take it down and
put it back together and stir

790
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,460
see if I have any scripts car

791
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,730
only got a minute left

792
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:52,290
you know it was just was just

793
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,700
keep going so to other other tests that
I've done with thing as

794
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,799
I help Colin Miller do some testing on
as

795
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,690
patch Troy tool I did a a nice little
thing where I automated the

796
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,490
testing and JavaScript interface this
water bill is really interesting and it

797
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,390
allows like

798
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:14,569
horrible browsers to actually execute
commands on your device which is

799
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:18,180
you know pretty nasty as far as on
abilities go

800
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,690
on it was a lot of work to do that I had
to look up for a lotta love

801
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,920
a had to look up a lotta ways to
automate different things

802
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,180
so these devices I keep them all in

803
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,279
airplane mode pretty much all the time
so in order to do this testing I needed

804
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,140
to turn on wifi for all them trying to
figure out how do I do that

805
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,089
by them I've never provision for wifi so
I was like wow how do I provision wifi

806
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:43,410
on my how do I tell it what my network
is without having to go to eat wanna

807
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,339
type it all in

808
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:47,680
and so there was a lot of things came I
love our meeting that

809
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,259
I'll I have to find the script I didn't
put it up somewhere without passwords in

810
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:51,619
there

811
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:55,080
what happened and I i'm used to

812
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,230
use to a subset so you can see from the
device up with Liz

813
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:03,240
had for Nexus 7 tablet I use those for
some browser posing

814
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,649
up for par the book and that was really
interesting

815
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,320
to do on you know seeing the brother pop
up a lot

816
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,750
smartphone so there's a lot of things
you can do with it

817
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,950
and and they're very helpful so let us
learn to up

818
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,259
over over or the couple years I've had
this there's various problems that have

819
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,040
appeared

820
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,490
you know you end up with things fall off
and

821
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:29,250
the software control the hubs helps with
that sometimes it doesn't help with that

822
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,050
i won device in particular that if it
fall off and I put it back on

823
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,450
actually have to go and like change
configuration manually

824
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,399
otherwise it will run a TB I'll

825
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,720
so there's little weird know what like
that with some other devices and then

826
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,790
also you get like random sounds
emanating

827
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,050
a there some manner there some Samsung
devices that

828
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:52,230
the like you know do some fancy beep
when they finish charging

829
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,190
sometimes there just discharge a little
bit and I'll charge again

830
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,560
so you get that going on it's
distracting you can always put this

831
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,320
in another room for a worker yes and I
mention the battery issues

832
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,750
so young I've replaced probably a
handful batteries at this point

833
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,410
so in the future I'd like to like a
mention get more devices if you have

834
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,430
some older devices that you don't want

835
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,690
are please donate and your get your name
added to the Prime

836
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,760
in the preemie or if you like if not we
can keep you and I miss I'll

837
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,780
I want to automate further so

838
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,200
there's a couple tools print map in cat
has access to a row

839
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,399
print map will allow you to look at
running processes and what permissions

840
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,410
users group and so on that is how and

841
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,529
which is really important for a system
that's thats

842
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:44,410
up that so for which separated like
Android like everything's kinda running

843
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,330
with a different user and everything has
different groups access

844
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,660
so that's really important to a wanna
put that together

845
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:55,080
the with can as access and and some of
the other cup device comparison

846
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,799
style so can as access does a similar
thing but with the file system so it's

847
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,040
kinda like find

848
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,950
slash you know dash perm four thousand
or whatever but

849
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,500
it actually looks more than just what
you tell on

850
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,020
one fine command line and will
prioritize the output for you so you

851
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,540
give

852
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,050
if there are set you any binary still be
at the top and after are things that you

853
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,359
can read will be at the bottom

854
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,830
and I'm also open to suggestions you
know this is all on get out

855
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,130
all the tools are ghetto if anybody
wants to contribute anything and please

856
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:24,619
do

857
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:28,089
just just terrible requester or hit me
on IRC or

858
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:32,930
Twitter whatever we can coordinate a
their conclusion device differences

859
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,240
complicates cure research

860
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,080
Android the fragmentation issue in they
know they say it's or

861
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,470
a bad word when you say fragmentation
although I'm okay with same backwards

862
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:45,500
it really does cause problems on all
sides

863
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,180
it help it because problems on defense
to cause problems on offense

864
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,790
cause problems everywhere so this is one
way that we can help on both sides to

865
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:53,720
make it

866
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,450
easier to do research and to be to do
more effective research

867
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,950
with Andrew it's definitely worth the
investment so I think

868
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:05,319
all in all all the hardware and old all
the wires everything that I have their

869
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,339
its did the total cost was under ten
thousand dollars

870
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:12,339
most devices I got from other people
were there for you

871
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:16,420
or on ebay I paid the most was like her
twenty dollars in averages more like

872
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,440
sixty dollars

873
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,589
to the recommended if you're going to do
this definitely follow recommendations

874
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:23,810
that are in the slides

875
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:27,570
ask around for devices filed a buying
guide lines to make it most cost

876
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,580
effective for you contributor tools and
you know

877
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,299
you're welcome to join tried to cars
here whatever and ask questions there as

878
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,240
well

879
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,790
so at this point a we're gonna do a Q&A
have this book here

880
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,940
the first first press copy I'll

881
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,040
for Jason mentioned he has some other
copies those are a

882
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,800
second press copies so this is a one of
the first one of the few remaining that

883
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,859
I have for Spurs copies

884
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:57,350
so we will do this is to Rs like the
best question

885
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:01,069
will get the book so thinkable good
question /url real quick right now and

886
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,119
I'll answer

887
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:05,170
and West when I say question is a

888
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,510
it's nice if it's related to talk it's
nice if it's related and reprint doesn't

889
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,710
have to be could be anything

890
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:14,550
really so let's do this

891
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:14,800
yep
