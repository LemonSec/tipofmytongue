1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,940
so hopefully not a thing about a false
leaves pretty same topic so

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,799
arm I'm not decipher call him doctor
Phil

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,960
but not the doctor Phil arm

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,119
the yessir he the other doctor Phil

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,400
okay a hump so doctor Phil poster is
joining us today

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,890
from a that's a bit bluntly at
Bloomsburg University

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,760
well just change straight so come there
are some

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,910
and very cool exciting topic I mean I
don't know if

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,099
I can goal a week now with our reading
something about drones

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,810
somewhere about them falling on people
now there's a public talk about her

11
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,630
I'm ten just the general use of drones
the commercially surrounds a private use

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,160
drones and this topic which is
autonomous hacking drones which

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,489
brings up mind to mine like Terminator
movie

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,920
type stuff but I am let's get started in
a give

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,290
doctor Phil the doctor Phil a warm round
of applause face

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:09,509
alright

17
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:13,170
play too this wanna

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,659
okay now it is alright well i'm happy to
be here even if I'm in the sleeper slot

19
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:22,579
I'm not gonna be two particular that so
wanna talk a little bit today

20
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:25,749
about remote hacking Jones not all
drones

21
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:29,310
live by the way but on we'll talk about
some that do

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,780
some that don't so what is

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,469
this talking to be about anyway I I
wanna talk a little bit

24
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:41,380
about how you can do some hakim and
forensics was some small stuff

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,649
I its small see you can stash should

26
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,920
and it's also small and low-power see
kid

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,969
maybe run this thing off a batteries for
a couple days switch

28
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,850
opens up some possibilities also going
to talk about

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,969
how you can take a whole

30
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,458
army are these guys and put them
together and do some really cool stuff

31
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:07,450
at least its cool if you're doing the
stuff for not getting the stuff done to

32
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:07,740
you

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,869
and all that are did want to point out

34
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,470
over in the table on they'll left side I
guess you're right side

35
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,710
I just have a couple little things up
there feel free to go

36
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,280
look at those poke at those are just a
couple little devices

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,950
that a brown along with me i apologize.
would have brought more I'm in the

38
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,890
process of moving across the country

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,029
so all my really cool stuff is kinda
packed

40
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,180
solved alright so why should you care
about this stuff anyway

41
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,600
well I'm gonna talk about how you can

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,870
take these little devices you can run
this nice

43
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,980
full-featured Linux distro on on very
flexible

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,850
you can go to a pen test with the bag
kinda like my little backpack here

45
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,049
and pack one or two dozen these devices
in their

46
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,020
configure them per year pen test
requirements

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,100
on the spot and just hack away

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,079
on another nice feature about some other
stuff gonna talk about

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,910
you can do this remotely alright so
these devices

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,960
are typically have a range of up to a
mile

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,100
so you can be a mile down the road by
the hotel pool

52
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,870
orchestrating this whole pen testing
just hacking the crap outta your target

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,050
okay on also you know

54
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,910
if you like that sort of thing you can
fly and an aerial drone

55
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,310
and do that as well night so who am i as
i said

56
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,760
are I'm in a transition I'm moving to
Pennsylvania

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,380
next week nom been programming since I
was

58
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,150
8 plane around electronic since I was 12
also been known to

59
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,540
fly planes bill planes things like that
hi

60
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,400
so and we'll talk a little bit about
choosing a platform

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,180
are in looking at aircraft uses

62
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,890
for what kinda things you want all

63
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,950
introduced the DAC which is what I call
my twin X

64
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,690
distro not give you a real brief

65
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,228
introduction to what can you do with one
of these devices

66
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,709
are and then getting to the good stuff
you know talk about networks that these

67
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,650
devices

68
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,719
and how you can work with that and then
at the and

69
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:30,710
I will talk a little bit about how you
can make the stuff more Thomas

70
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,469
using things like pipe

71
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:38,330
Heights ill what are the goals that I
was looking for

72
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,889
when I decided to start doing this stuff
well I wanted something that was small

73
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,990
something that's low-powered you know so
I can run out of batteries something

74
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,289
it's affordable

75
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,539
I'm a props on poor I'm

76
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:56,740
something that's mature you don't want
to be on the bleeding edge

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,360
when you're deploying this in the field
something with networking USB

78
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,050
lot a nice input output options

79
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,789
and the winning platform for me is the
big upon black

80
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:17,120
I the BeagleBone black is one in a
family of boards if you're not familiar

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,740
with the BeagleBoard

82
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,840
org for organization they've been making
these boards for a while

83
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,169
and the big one black is the latest
board that they have

84
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,758
small there's a couple upon over on the
table there if you wanna see you

85
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,800
job less than 10 wats

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,139
thats everything just the board itself
needs less than two what's

87
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:46,199
45 box pretty cheap gigahertz

88
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,199
cortex a 8 processor

89
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,199
have to get your RAM and Ethernet USB
all those good things built that

90
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:02,620
looks kinda like this against big long
black also known as

91
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,879
the Raspberry Pi killer home speaking of
which

92
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,009
I know at least somebody will ask me cuz
they always do

93
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,740
now why not use the Raspberry Pi

94
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,639
very well there's a few reasons why not

95
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,789
I in particular it's not as powerful

96
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:25,270
doesn't run as fast doesn't support
Ubuntu

97
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,159
very it's got an older architecture
that's not well supported

98
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,969
it's not open and I really like open
source stuff

99
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,819
are not as mature they've been doing
this stuff a lot longer

100
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:40,569
and in the end you'll end up spending
more money

101
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,610
if you use the pie just because when you
add in all the different components that

102
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,960
you need to get

103
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,068
arm ends up costing you more it's not as
reliable

104
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,349
again if you're gonna play something you
want something that's rock-solid

105
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:56,770
and also that are very energy-efficient

106
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,698
I don't have a lot of general purpose
i/o

107
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,710
and is kinda fragile the design

108
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,609
they have these little when pippen's
instead a nice beefy hatter's things

109
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,599
like that

110
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,050
not as compact so just a couple reasons

111
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,059
why I didn't use the parking

112
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:20,069
so when it comes to an aircraft you know
what I was looking for was something

113
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:20,870
that had a nice

114
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,430
payload about you could fly in the wind

115
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,089
what time she get these cheaper quad
copters and things like that

116
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:33,129
there indoors only great you get four
mile an hour wind in that thing is

117
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,979
gone everywhere I mean I had a little
toy helicopter I was supposedly

118
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,719
indoor/outdoor I took it outside one

119
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:43,360
one time it was like really scary
because Augusta when came in

120
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,699
took it up over the top in my house and
I couldn't see it in

121
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,189
you know thankfully I got it back sort
of undamaged

122
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:54,490
arm you know something they comply while

123
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,619
something they're all take my BeagleBone
a

124
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,729
XP adapter alpha wireless adapter and
things like that and again

125
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,029
I'm poor something I can afford so

126
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:09,319
for my purposes i'd shows

127
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,639
this guy a a 10 this guy is

128
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,259
nobody call the quad shot

129
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,659
it's a flying weighing that's capable of
vertical take offs and landings

130
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,188
on because it can be flown as an
airplane has

131
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,199
better pay loading has better flight
times because Klein is an airplane is a

132
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,250
lot more efficient

133
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,419
and finds a quadcopter but you take it
off and land vertically

134
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,769
for so you can apply it to your targeted

135
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,490
landed on the roof packed the crap outta
home

136
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,810
flyway right that's kinda the idea

137
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,258
as I said it's called potshot comp

138
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:55,870
and all these nice criteria you can

139
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,699
you can fly it for like eight to 15
minutes which is typically enough

140
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:04,359
also some other models use XP or talk a
little bit more about

141
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,199
XP later and that was a good thing

142
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:11,529
are has a built-in cameras camera mount

143
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,570
and if you get the pre-assembled one
that I used it about 400

144
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,240
not pre-assembled if you get the
complete kit that's got the radio and

145
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
everything's about 400 bucks

146
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,680
right so not too bad the

147
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,138
arts let's talk a little about the deck
your new favorite disco

148
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,759
3 are originally I developed this for
the BeagleBone

149
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,100
are big aboard XM which is another
bigger board it's a desktop replacement

150
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,810
boorda have

151
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,518
one of those running over there actually
I have one running in my buzz lightyear

152
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,850
lunch box

153
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,899
with the touch screen and the other one
is just there

154
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,130
are and later as the BeagleBone black

155
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,259
came out I am ported it to that which

156
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:00,500
was a no brainer are the deck is based
on Ubuntu

157
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,920
and it's got good repository support and
all those other things that

158
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,689
make Ubuntu so popular

159
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,430
right so what kinda things can you do
with the deck

160
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,599
again if you just have one device you
can do all your standard kinda stuff

161
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,680
so what's everyone's favorite exploit in
the whole wide world

162
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,899
any conference to go to it's going to
have it amorcito 806

163
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:30,759
up okay so here's just an example loved

164
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,290
yeah that's in there so you know get
Metasploit

165
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,599
Iran and man up you're like oh look port
445 delivered

166
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,040
fingerprinting is XP Service Pack 2 box

167
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,500
fire a better sport late

168
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,639
go ahead loader exploit

169
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,819
and get a martyr for Shell very

170
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,469
which is kinda cool if you think about
it it's like I just hacked

171
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,250
your dust-up with my forty five dollar

172
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,800
beagle and I use less than 10 lots to do
it

173
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,529
are alls also wifi Wireless cracking

174
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,870
is getting to be more and more common as
part a penthouse

175
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,990
so course he can run up aircrack sweet

176
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,350
nom you can find some

177
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,579
interesting networks to hack incidently

178
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:29,370
when I do these when I do live demos
especially around the university's

179
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,420
I get some interesting results right I
he probably can't read this too well but

180
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,630
its listing all that

181
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,009
previously connected networks for all
the clients out there

182
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,240
and I was amazed one time I saw several
guys

183
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,870
had just a long list at strip clubs

184
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,750
I thought okay that's interesting so
what do you tell your wife for your

185
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,490
girlfriend

186
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,740
I am only there for the wireless you
know

187
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,110
I don't know that they even had wires
but

188
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,449
so yah I aircrack you can you could run
that

189
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:07,689
you can crack passwords using Hydra or

190
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,860
ex hydro if you prefer

191
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,550
you can do a little better WPS packing

192
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,819
what tool to use for that

193
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,709
they want because don't hack wireless

194
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,529
for for WPS Reaver Reaver

195
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,379
I so you can run River and

196
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:37,050
you know that works too

197
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,029
you can honer Windows box like it's

198
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,129
a Mac right might say but feel that
should be poem

199
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:48,509
Windows like a boss right arm

200
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:52,579
and here's what I mean by like a Mac if
you guys remember I wanna say

201
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:56,209
early 2012 there is a big thing

202
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,119
700,000 max hacked

203
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,610
great dollar PC users are like yeah

204
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,139
we've been telling you that we should
protect yourself and

205
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,990
what a lot of people didn't realize is
that was this job a problem that existed

206
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,730
on the Windows machines as well

207
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,490
cell nom just loaded up Metasploit

208
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,050
and boom you know you hacked up

209
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,128
Windows seven box up

210
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,879
I don't think you can read it think yes
probably good thing

211
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,060
because it actually is a box it might
former University

212
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,779
Cup some other

213
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:39,850
fun things you can do with the deck on
you can run

214
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,290
fern wifi cracker none of you guys are
familiar with that

215
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,759
it's what I call it click kitty friendly

216
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,079
tool are get as ever heard the term
click kitty

217
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,099
before is a trademark term

218
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,129
that I share with another guy in
Scotland

219
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:01,040
about we all know what script kiddies
are right getty's

220
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,269
right click kiddies are lower than the

221
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,290
skits Harry they can only hack

222
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,430
with Louis tools they can't download
those scripts they can only

223
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,138
hack with Curis alright cell up for
Nizza

224
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,949
good clip Katie tool arm basically

225
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,769
you just run it it's written in Python
it uses aircrack in the background

226
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:29,350
arm you read it up sare this is 101 hack

227
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,600
this is the interface here's the
networks

228
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,470
packed this one and it tells you when
it's done it's pretty simple to use

229
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,870
art so let's get to the good stuff 802
15 for networking

230
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,389
sometimes called XP we must not
technically correct

231
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:50,300
is a nice way love

232
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,160
networking with devices you can use it
as a

233
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,189
mesh network nom

234
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,930
gonna talk a little bit about the basics
oviedo 215 for

235
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,339
are some other hardware involve some
other similar cases like

236
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,680
here to these devices anyone to talk

237
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,410
and we'll get into the slightly more
harder cases

238
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,110
where you wanna do true mesh networking
things like that

239
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,329
heart so able to $15.4 is typically used
in some low power

240
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:26,508
embedded systems there's to

241
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,920
flavors a XBee modules that you can get

242
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,349
from digi the Jesus big manufacture

243
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,889
these devices they have the regular ones
that are good for about 300 feet

244
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:41,589
and then have the Pro versions which are
good for about a mile

245
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:45,560
I they have two different modes of
operation you can use

246
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,989
AT commands from you might be old enough
to remember AT commands with your case

247
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,430
compatible modems I see a couple palms
up there

248
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,319
alright I'll or you can use an API mode

249
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,649
its relatively low speed 250 kbps

250
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,860
arm supports multiple typology such as
peer to peer

251
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,920
start apologies and messed up policies

252
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,550
did he makes a whole bunch of these guys
on this is just I'll

253
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,170
showing you some love the different
options available are you probably don't

254
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,920
wanna use all these

255
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,229
on you probably want to stick with just
the 2.4 gigahertz models

256
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,819
because their legal and every country
see we travel a lot

257
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:32,540
you might rather use those then summer
the other models that

258
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,370
you know some of them have ridiculous
range is like 16 miles

259
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,990
but you can only use in the US conflict
that

260
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,610
on so the hardware

261
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,550
that I am using is made by digi on

262
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,979
it's a 3.3 volt device if you have a
regular device

263
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,920
it'll consume fifty million amps at 3.3
volt

264
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,329
and if you get the pros 295 millions

265
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,199
so it's a huge difference in power usage

266
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,270
mom one thinks it's a little a little
bit annoying

267
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,959
about them the used to know meter pin
spacing

268
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,110
arm even though they're made in the US
made at Minnesota

269
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,059
now is you something you may know most

270
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:23,389
devices in the US is .1 answer 2.54
millimeter spacing so you typically have

271
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,100
to get an adapter

272
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,279
for that there's two basic families

273
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,480
up these series one in series 2

274
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,760
very inventive naming on

275
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,510
sometimes the series two are called CB
devices

276
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,590
that the differences the series two
devices can be used for mesh networking

277
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,879
and the series 1 devices are little bit
simpler

278
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,230
on and you pretty much use those for

279
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,360
peer to peer start apologies things like
that

280
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,908
on so slightly higher power consumption

281
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,140
on the series 1

282
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,200
are nice thing about it though is it
works out of the box

283
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,860
especially if you want to use it in what
they call transparent mode

284
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,299
where sensually take to these devices
and replace

285
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,820
a serial connection grain very easy to
use

286
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,879
the series 2 can do mass networking you
don't have to do much networking but

287
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,659
it's available to you

288
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:28,870
one downside to the series two adapters
is you have to load

289
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,080
the firmware and all the devices saying
this device is a router

290
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,189
this devices and and device

291
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,730
this device is a coordinator

292
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,029
if it's a up end device gets to go to
sleep it's a coordinator

293
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:48,770
that's not so cool if you're network
coordinator decides that it just wants

294
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,389
to go to sleep

295
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,490
things like that so up

296
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,549
alright so the simplest case you can
take to these

297
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,559
guys and her come together and

298
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,549
replace a serial connection

299
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:08,870
so before you can do that you have to
configure XP modems

300
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,709
now did he provides since offer its
called XCT you

301
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,940
that you can use for this comp

302
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,539
it used only run under Windows and the
recently released

303
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,120
a Mac version on also runs great

304
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,320
on lanix under Wine use it all the time

305
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,740
there's also another alternative out
there which honestly don't

306
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,919
really use but it's up there up

307
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,020
as well so

308
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,220
here's how this works on if you have an
XP moto

309
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,490
which wears shown in the previous
picture we'll see a couple over a table

310
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:52,500
wanna look on you put them in a USB
adapter you plug it into your laptop

311
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,279
for your desktop you're on the software
and you just configure

312
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,830
it and you have to tell a couple things

313
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,908
like what speed will a talk at in the
cum outta the box to commit

314
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:09,090
you know leisurely 9600 baud you
probably wanna jacked up

315
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,418
a little bit and

316
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,750
if series 2 again you have to tell us
what it's gonna be

317
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,750
when it grows up and you have to give it

318
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,770
what's called up an idea personal area
network

319
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,429
ID very so it'll to $15.4 as per the 802

320
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:29,549
15 series you probably are familiar with
802 15

321
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:35,260
one also known as Bluetooth that's
another personal area network

322
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,129
on so personal area networks tend to be
more flexible

323
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,230
but not as school fast some other
networking

324
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,360
on so you can pick up an idea you know

325
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,270
you can get creative you can use 1337 or

326
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,279
maybe just 337 you know

327
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,460
he feel extra-special on

328
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,419
or you can go with the defaults unless
somebody is using

329
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,520
XP at their facility

330
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,389
are there probably won't notice it which
is another advantage abusing this for

331
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,169
your commanding control

332
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,500
for most people you know you know if you
run around with the wireless analyzer

333
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,240
you not cassia operates on different
channels

334
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,510
which is no way since to stop that's out
there om

335
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,309
see you can pick a destination address

336
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:26,500
you know one 0

337
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,480
and he said your personal address

338
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,779
to the other address right pick a number

339
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,809
pick two numbers you like and then you
just

340
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,330
rate that information to your modems
plug them into your devices

341
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,580
and pretty much you can talk

342
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,990
right and here's a screenshot what is
that software look like

343
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,020
you know I pretty much you plug it in
you can say please tell me what's

344
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,360
on in this mode on how is it configured
right now

345
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,939
and you can gonna go from there

346
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,570
art so by default these adapters work in
this transparent mode

347
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,760
where everything that comes in on the
wires just sent out wirelessly

348
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,260
and vice versa so if you want to talk

349
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,330
to her hacking drone you can set up TTY

350
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,439
on the drone just log in right

351
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,340
a lot of people are like TTY what's that
you know some of us remember

352
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,870
dumb terminals login and things like
that right

353
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,229
on nice thing about this it's simple

354
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,010
it works with interactive programs home

355
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,770
and another advantage if you go out a
range like let's say I have my laptop

356
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,879
here

357
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,330
and I'm connecting to a drone and then I
go away and go to lunch

358
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:51,908
when I come back I'm still up if I use
this map

359
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:56,020
so how do you do it on under drone you
have to tell that to do TTY

360
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,029
because most Linux systems today don't
do that %uh the box for good reasons

361
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:05,510
right so basically if you just cut and
paste the stuff here on the screen

362
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,700
into a file in at sea in it

363
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,919
right and call it

364
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,659
TTY 02 that the capital oneida 0

365
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:24,700
and you put this in there then you can
run it by Saint start

366
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,070
pursue does start if you need TTY 02

367
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,240
boom cocaine I got a terminal I can log
n

368
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,950
using the XP link

369
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,010
very easy to do also your a little bit

370
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,580
what this looks like leader on

371
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,769
well what if you want to have more than
one drone I mean

372
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:49,820
you might think well gee fell one drawn
that scandal

373
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,408
you know an army of one that has to be a
saying I guess but

374
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:57,409
not a great get same but the same arm
cyl

375
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:02,399
you might say whoa I want to have more
than one okay you can still do that

376
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:06,768
and basically what you do is you just
set different

377
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:09,929
my addresses for each year drones

378
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:14,799
and then you set the same to address our
destination address

379
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,510
for all the all the drones to say 0 for

380
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:23,669
which will be your command console and
then how do you switch back and forth

381
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,890
well you have to enter this command mode
is AT command mode

382
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,340
so how do you do that Paul here the
enter are you hit plus three times

383
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,769
and you wait until it was okay and in
the senate some commands

384
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:40,809
such as eighty DL and then the name and
the drone

385
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,799
you wanna talk to you its address then
you're right it with eighty WR

386
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,139
and then you say ATC and which means
please ghettos command mode cuz I wanna

387
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,730
talk to my device

388
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,309
home you can also talk to more than one
device at a time

389
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:04,769
if you wanna use this arm API mode

390
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,409
which incidently is what I recommend the
nice thing about the API mode

391
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,549
is that it will put all your data in
packets

392
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:17,679
right so if you have a malformed packet
it gets ignored

393
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,740
so there's any kind and always summer
you may have used Wireless dumb

394
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,110
terminals before

395
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,600
and you'll notice that sometimes you get
crap that comes up or

396
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,719
you know maybe something you didn't do
that I'm sure at least 10 view was ever

397
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,019
used the BBS

398
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:36,570
so you probably use to some random know
is occasionally coming up

399
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,549
and that eliminates that our
performances little bit better

400
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:44,740
will give you tips all make sure that
all of your modems

401
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,769
or in one mode are the other mode

402
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:52,890
I spent a couple hours tracing down a
problem which I thought was with my code

403
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:58,570
because a mic wise though the lights
blinking but it's not getting anything

404
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,840
that's because that guy was set into AP
I'm only other guy wasn't

405
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,240
so it dropped everything as it was in
the pocket

406
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,110
right arm so once you do this

407
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,600
then you probably wanna talk to your
modem somehow tear

408
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,309
packing drone somehow you got a couple
of choices you can use Java

409
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:22,340
you can use Python which is what I did
RP really don't like yourself much you

410
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,240
could send rock data

411
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,720
to the poor if you get a lot of free
time

412
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,690
nom cyl

413
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,410
really for each the drones each the
drones thinks they're the

414
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,460
the center of the universe five children
right I am the favorite

415
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,320
they don't know about everybody else
they just know they're talking to the

416
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,510
command console

417
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:47,710
home rights to

418
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,450
if you want to use Python which is what
I did basically what I have is every

419
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,520
drone has a little process on it

420
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,740
and that process just sits and listens
for commands

421
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,230
from the command console all the stuff
that's don

422
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,570
is logged all the communications back
and forth

423
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:11,000
there's a facility for announcements
there's also a facility to send small

424
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,970
files

425
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,690
so let's say I wanna send a new script
20 microns I just do it

426
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,140
arm code for this available on my get
home

427
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:26,800
which is referenced here you can also go
with true mass networking

428
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,678
you know I'm there there's a nice hotel
mile away

429
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:36,330
but there's a nicer hotel two miles away
so I'll just drop a couple a router's

430
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,490
in between you can do those sorts of
things here's the thing that's called on

431
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:40,790
it

432
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,950
there's no software changes Harry all
that has to change as you have to

433
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,790
configure

434
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:50,330
the motives right your software doesn't
care your drones don't know that they're

435
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,210
running series wonder series to stop the
terror in a master networker star

436
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:54,730
network

437
00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:01,730
they don't know they don't care it's all
this very

438
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,070
in when you do that as they said before
at least one of these has to be a

439
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,350
controller

440
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,020
and you can have routers the nice thing
about the routers

441
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,170
as you can have them stand alone you can
get a battery

442
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,120
you can hook up to 10 these routers
brought in a bush outside your

443
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,409
target you know if they're really far
away just

444
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,440
you know Broadcom trail back to your
hotel

445
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,370
maybe all the way back to the pool I
don't know depends on where you wanna be

446
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:34,290
up it's nice though arm to have this
remote ability it's also nice because

447
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,540
you know these drones don't ever go to
sleep

448
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,970
after the bathroom have to eat already
those things

449
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,520
alright so when it comes to building
grounds

450
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,820
are pretty much a need to put together
some hardware

451
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,379
on so here's a example than XP

452
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,640
module on top other

453
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,600
BeagleBone black is in a lil homemade
adapter

454
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,678
if you want to get a copy the doc

455
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,000
it's available on SourceForge as the
link for a lot

456
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
are just a little notes if you get an
offer source forge

457
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,030
I did apt cash clean on it

458
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,260
com which saved about 1.7 gig

459
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,450
up space more importantly 1.7 gigs you
don't have to download

460
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,710
when you download the archive 30 big
enough

461
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,580
get yourself a nice fast has the card

462
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,050
and use this script provided

463
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,850
and you're in business if you don't do
any that there are a couple people

464
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,020
including specially computing that'll to
sell you one that's pretty messed up

465
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,700
you wanna power if you look on the table
you see I got some

466
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,560
some pretty basic power supplies nom

467
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,730
just a few components here's some
pictures

468
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:57,850
so the white cable is just a USB cable
so if I wanna touch my lease to the back

469
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:02,320
on the desktop somewhere I can lead to
power of other

470
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,678
arm I can also use batteries wall warts

471
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,940
things like power if you want to use
batteries

472
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,850
D cells are your best option

473
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,040
you can run this thing for better than
two days of the cells

474
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,330
sell forty cells or three chargeable 5d
cells

475
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:26,360
up and here's just a couple other

476
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,909
802 15 for adopters on a very spiegel's

477
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,330
including some of the older bemoans and

478
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,340
looks like a repeat slide very mom

479
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,260
as I said before the adapters you need
to have an adapter most cases because

480
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,179
the pins

481
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:47,370
her us non-standard pitch see you can
buy these

482
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,620
from Adafruit is a good place I'm

483
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,689
you're gonna need at least one USB
adapter

484
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,190
so that you can connect it to your
laptop

485
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:03,300
if you're going to wire up your own
adapter it's not that hard

486
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,870
Harry you can just connect four wires

487
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,409
you not get instructions up on their get
Hobbes for this

488
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,480
up and then you have to tell your
BeagleBone hey

489
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,500
here's how to use these for wires

490
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,820
actually two wires because to emerge as
power wires

491
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,500
right and here's how you do that so what
you do

492
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,080
is you connect your com

493
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,230
XP to the 4 pins listed here

494
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:37,429
on the expansion hatter's and you can
have a little script like this

495
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:43,290
that just echoes some just act is the
value BB you work to

496
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,210
into a certain file and that tells the
BeagleBone hey somebody has

497
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,440
installed something on this particular
UART

498
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,570
this particular serial port

499
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,600
put that in a startup file and it
restarts every time you reboot

500
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm if you don't wanna cider for wires

501
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,400
you can get a cape which is an expansion
board for the Beagle

502
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,409
in his pocket and com

503
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:14,040
I have designs for that available

504
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,418
mom differ different forms including the
miniature form repeat

505
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,200
just wanna you know make it really
simple but you don't want to release

506
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,950
otter

507
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,940
arm I'm also working out when I called
the polish Cape

508
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,460
that combines XP networking

509
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,390
Wireless and maybe some other stuff

510
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:41,080
also looking at Tom ways to

511
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,939
home add functionality like if you look
at the current

512
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,730
aerial drone that I have and actually
doesn't use the BeagleBone for flying

513
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,480
but I would like to change that because
it be more flexible and stuff like that

514
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,169
and of course everyone is a nice
container so if you look at the table

515
00:32:58,169 --> 00:32:59,770
you'll see some of these containers

516
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:05,700
including my buzz lightyear lunch box
why Buzz Lightyear

517
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,179
I'm gonna hack you to infinity and
beyond that's why

518
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:14,530
right so here's a picture my Buzz
Lightyear lunch box which is currently

519
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,340
running over there

520
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,760
arm if you wanna plan a device say
behind someone's desk

521
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,870
something like this works well are you
can get this little USB hub for actually

522
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,250
this is a network upn

523
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,760
that can be usb-powered you can see it's
pretty small

524
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,990
here's a picture that next to BeagleBone

525
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,400
just plug it into the back of someone's
computer leach of power for the

526
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,650
BeagleBone leach of power for their

527
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,640
on for the network ARB plugging in line

528
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,590
to their networking that exist and
you're good to go

529
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,939
alright home if you want to do the air
DAC

530
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,650
when do the aerial drone it's pretty
simple

531
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,970
and there are a couple ways you can go
if you just wanna have a router

532
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,280
to extend the range on if you buy

533
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,429
and XP word from transition robotics
that make the quad shot

534
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,460
the Kings do that you don't have to do
anything or you can put a full-blown

535
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,699
packing drone on it um

536
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:21,609
and basically I'll just quickly go
through the steps your special you take

537
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:22,319
the lead

538
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,679
for the brain box the little bored that
runs

539
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,840
the quad shot and you put your
BeagleBone on their you line it up for

540
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,889
the holes

541
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,560
drill the holes taken off before you
drill more holes

542
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,620
and then on the inside you arm put in

543
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,089
the innards about alpha adapter mister
more holes

544
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,510
and then you get something looks kinda
like this arm

545
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:53,030
and then you're ready to go off and fly
and poon away

546
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,669
art so what kinda things can you do up

547
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:00,720
simple cases network attacks if you have
just one drone

548
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,339
wanna do stuff remotely you know

549
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:08,440
allows you to have from a distance you
can do that again you could use series 1

550
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,620
adopters

551
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,279
super simple not allow to set up

552
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,490
you could go with multiple drones

553
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,490
up

554
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,839
so if you're just gonna use to drones

555
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:29,250
aaron is TTY mode just get your favorite
terminal program

556
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,970
run it up in again like I said before
here's an example

557
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,540
it's probably hard to see for you guys
but I'm actually running commands on two

558
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,820
different drones

559
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,180
and I'm using that plus plus plus eighty
deal

560
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:48,089
commands in order to switch between the
different roles

561
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:53,270
right win your running the Python stuff
that I wrote

562
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:58,040
what happens is I bring up a window that
your command window and you can send

563
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,690
commands to your different drones if you
wanna switch drones you just start

564
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,230
command with Colin

565
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,580
and then the name the number up the
drone

566
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,779
on and it will bring up

567
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,140
a separate window for each drone that
has all the

568
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,310
output from that role

569
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,350
this is all logged I'm using an advanced
facility

570
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,480
to display the stuff it's called tale
thing never heard over

571
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,580
right I know it's kinda stupid but it
works right go

572
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,450
and has the managed a log everything as
well

573
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,600
so here's kinda resume in the showing
you what

574
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,609
the command console looks like and
here's the results window for one am i

575
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:45,990
drones

576
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:50,290
alright if you want to build the air
duct

577
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,470
he complied and as I said you can use it
just as a router

578
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,799
to extend the range landed on the roof

579
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,120
you know and here's my recommendation

580
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,420
if you're not a very good RC highlight
and your crush the thing

581
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,670
you can probably get away with going
insane hey

582
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,250
no sorry but i cud crash might weigh on
your roof

583
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,650
keiko get and most people are gonna say

584
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,140
sure no problem and while you're there
what you gonna do

585
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,650
case the place gather some more
reconfirmation social engineering later

586
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,330
right but you probably can't crash if
they're like

587
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,620
a couple the times they might start
getting suspicious

588
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,560
are also maybe the you have a pent asked
where there's not good

589
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,850
availability you can't get physical
access

590
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,040
you could just fly in the one drawn
again

591
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,880
arm if you crash it on the roof

592
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,940
do your pen test then tell them about

593
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,020
haha I crash that sorry

594
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,330
I'm other things you could do you could
put a high-powered pro XP adapter

595
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:04,650
and the aerial drone and could use the
nice low-powered XP adapters

596
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,270
for other drones may be papered in the
bushes

597
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:13,620
run to target things like that our that
way they don't use as much battery power

598
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,440
and you can fly the drone in and out

599
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,680
alright in last little bit i wanna talk
about

600
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,410
how could you automate some other stuff
with Python

601
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:31,410
and I realize that summary slides are
going to be a little bit hard to

602
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,920
understand all the stuffs available

603
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,850
on my website arm also my book

604
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,359
but to you know basically

605
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,730
you you want to start out first by
saying what's out there

606
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,850
now personally I don't like

607
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:53,240
complete automation you know I had a
hacking class i tot want

608
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,500
where the student the took down the
target for a test

609
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,010
Mike what did you do any set I don't
know I just clicked

610
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,690
right his running armitage had no idea
what kinda attacks is running just

611
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,670
clicked

612
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,930
right on it's like those wifi pineapples

613
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,990
psych I can't think of any use for those
because why would you just one attack

614
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,020
everybody you know usually if you doing

615
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,310
authorize pen testing you probably have
a specific target in mind

616
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:26,380
but anyway so this is a basic script
that uses Kb

617
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,820
it's just a few lines long and it will
run

618
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,710
per minute and it will tell you here's
all the networks that I felt

619
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:38,170
K anyone escapee because runner

620
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:43,359
couple %uh via to nice Python tool

621
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,569
some other things that you can do

622
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:51,330
you can capture some pockets again you
can use Kb for that

623
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,770
and a script to do that looks kinda like
this he just

624
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,890
imports KP import

625
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,069
the option parser comp

626
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:05,320
how many in your paper on programmers

627
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,250
couple how many the red TJ o'connor's
book

628
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,390
beilin pipe right

629
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,400
the book to a plug for TJ but arm

630
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,970
also another good source for Python if
you look at security 2 per pen tester

631
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,939
Academy

632
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,630
event awesome pipe on classic both for
those sources will tell you a lot about

633
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,240
how to use Kb

634
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,640
very but so I'm basically coming up with
a

635
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,069
client list and a packet list I'm

636
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:39,279
you define a packet handler function so
every time etc

637
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,480
receives a packet it just call that
function

638
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,550
and in that function and you do things
like

639
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,850
decide whether or not you're gonna log
in

640
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:54,600
right so here's a pretty basic

641
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,490
capturing function now that you figured
out what wireless networks are out there

642
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,049
course gonna do your standard staff you
gonna hack into them

643
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,170
once that's done the next question you
can ask yourself is

644
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:11,150
what's out there very an what's the go
to talk for that

645
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,240
pretty much and map as a good place to
start

646
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,500
out there is a python module for and map
as well

647
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,800
in this little script here on the slide
in the next

648
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,830
are or actually use that

649
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,029
Python and Matt module and then it will
store the results

650
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,900
in what's called the Jason file his
family with Jason

651
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,730
JSON yep very popular with web
developers

652
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,450
its JavaScript object that work for men
it

653
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,750
some like that but its human readable
also very popular and of course Python

654
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,280
library for it

655
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,839
so what I do is doing and maps can

656
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,490
take those results storage a son file

657
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,089
and then use open bad as which is a open
source

658
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:01,779
equivalent to Nessus that doesn't have
all the licensing hassles and things

659
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,210
like that

660
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,380
and then I'll run and open baskin on the
interesting

661
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,569
things using p and map results right

662
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,700
so this is a nice little simple script
that I wrote

663
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,419
that'll do that the

664
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,319
and okay so that once maybe forty lines
long

665
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,940
right harm other things you can do

666
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,790
you can of course pirate Metasploit
using the command-line

667
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:34,480
up I'm guessing all most if you're
familiar with Metasploit

668
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,900
and the general form and if you're going
to use the command line

669
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,109
is you just run it you give it an air

670
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:45,790
exploit is set some parameters almost
always going to have to set

671
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,160
a host parameter

672
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,750
and some options

673
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:57,770
run X you know and is run right such a
payload run it

674
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,810
get your cell on all that okay

675
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,740
so some pictures things that i'm looking
to do you know I haven't stopped working

676
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,000
on this they've been

677
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,040
I've been working on this for a couple
years now

678
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,750
but you know continuing to add more
packages

679
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,319
to this platform right now there are
over 2,000

680
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:20,370
in the current version of the DAC on

681
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:24,380
gonna try to do some work optimization
for the Beagle platform

682
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,760
on expand the 80 to $15.4 code

683
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,220
I've already done a little bit that with
things like the ability to upload

684
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,250
scripts downloads group things like that

685
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,890
now looking at some other output options

686
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,410
also looking at export sporting the

687
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:47,470
USB on-the-go functionality

688
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:52,569
up and as I said before I wanna replace
that autopilot that's found on the quad

689
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:53,080
shot

690
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,370
with the big one black for a couple
reasons you know

691
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,500
I don't want the extra weight the extra
power

692
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,049
but the BeagleBone black is a lot more
powerful than a little bored that's in

693
00:44:03,049 --> 00:44:04,540
there

694
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,040
great so I want to get a lot about how
many on my drones

695
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,270
to where I can put a GPS in there and I
can say pay

696
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,920
fly the strong over here maybe circle
this cornett

697
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,850
this radius and just be done with it not
have to worry about

698
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,310
actually flying the DRO 3 I'm actually

699
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:27,600
an OK pilot Cup thousand hours in
doesn't ratings but

700
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,759
I suck at flying RC outlet

701
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,400
so I've crashed my drawn a few times on
so then I steps on his eight

702
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,980
hydration their on some other stuff that
I've done a little bit work with

703
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,670
is using the XP gateway to

704
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,010
extender range literally if you have
your

705
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,140
XP gateway device within the mile

706
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,589
and maybe your leeching off someone's
free wifi

707
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:57,490
say I can I can hack from another
country

708
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,279
really I can get somebody to go drop my
drones around

709
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,630
your building and come back

710
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,490
couple days every couple days in
replenish the batteries and

711
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,060
I could be I could even be here in
Hawaii

712
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,859
and how can you in Pennsylvania heard

713
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:20,120
com just a another note

714
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,370
all the stuff isn't look like for iBook

715
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,830
arm in this book which is not quite out
yet

716
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:30,089
so that's the bad news I don't have any
to give away but

717
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:33,180
everybody wins because the publisher

718
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,390
gave me a discount code for thirty
percent of ok

719
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:40,560
this book and any other

720
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,799
book from Sandra's cell I don't know

721
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:47,259
that necessarily is gonna give you the
best prices but let's say you want to

722
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:47,730
buy

723
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,540
some other books from same dress they
have

724
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,569
art and with that

725
00:45:55,569 --> 00:46:00,830
com if you have any questions if you
don't get your questions answered now

726
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:04,380
feel free to track me down later or type

727
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,069
already seen other speakers scoring
themselves out for Twitter followers so

728
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:12,690
