1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,020
people that a retort worked with in the
past in currently I knew this was gonna

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,000
be pretty exciting

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,059
and call talk and I couldn't take a
really a

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,989
kinda better way to wrap things up Brian
mention the stock several

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,150
times this morning because you know
everything in the world

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,409
to secure systems but if people can come
and touch them

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,380
and make love to them then the heck can
be all kinds about thanks to them

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,230
so odd let's give a a big big big warm
brown

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,269

companies

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,158
I'll aside from all that also was part
of the

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,609
up to church doesn't excuse the
standards team started about four years

22
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:15,119
ago

23
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,090
was a group of that started now think
wrong to a couple our people

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,399
that have got together and put together
a are a standard for how

25
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:26,420
10 testing should be conducted some or
20 of this for application testing

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,079
RP test is kind of a standard for help
countries and just be conducted from

27
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,100
presale all the way to reports and
laurels on top of the run

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,149
I want the peace of Commerce's Atlanta
ground-based so if you guys are in the

29
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,570
area

30
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,408
we do a an all-conference there as well
but really about me

31
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:47,829
up lebanon to offend some people their
all-time

32
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,270
I also like the void warranties and
still thence

33
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,429
and if you're a friend Montee Ball I
know that I'm pretty persistent and now

34
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,369
operate in life and work

35
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,780
so it's a little more truth about me so

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,889
how many people have actually seen a
talk about social engineer

37
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:08,179
probably everybody right so I promise
this talk won't be anything like this

38
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm not gonna be releasing the kinda
tools I'm not gonna show you how to use

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,599
automation framework so how to clone a
slight now the senate this because

40
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,298
everyone's really don't at least once
right

41
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,670
but before you actually get to important
for the stalking what

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,208
I want to tell you guys about we're
gonna have to start at the beginning

43
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:23,860
right

44
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,930
so was take a little stroll down memory
lane

45
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,840
talk about some things you guys are
probably already heard so everyone knows

46
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,489
that

47
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:34,409
your dumpster diving is bad right you
can still things about companies in

48
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,540
about organizations

49
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,000
I just buy things that go away whether
it's partners organizations they deal

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,400
with data that they don't think a sensor
that they fell Wayne is stealing use

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,010
against them

52
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,980
see for a dumpster diving you heard
about things like shoulder surfing

53
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,179
bad Dhoni by look over your shoulder to
the store your passwords

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,200
if there are things about fishing

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,839
fishing is bad should click links I
don't know what exactly that guy was

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,319
doing

57
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,599
but he did it wrong apparently and the
other guy have no idea what he's fishing

58
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,069
for

59
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,619
but everyone's heard of fishing right
and then if you actually

60
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,170
looked into browser security and and
settings for browsers

61
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,780
I E had this crazy thing years ago we
can actually tell and exporters and data

62
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,989
anytime click but was really over
fisher's we've also heard that

63
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,579
you know support staff are always great
targets right started the helpdesk

64
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,069
they like to reset passwords for you
they like to get out data a lot talking

65
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,179
calling to say

66
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,489
a name and I'll give you a password as
always great targets for fishing

67
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,030
social engineering human resources there
always a great target for attackers

68
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,329
they like to get out data but they also
like to open attachment

69
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,450
so we're going to break into a company
we like the same things to human

70
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,429
resources because they'll

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,480
typically open Word documents for a
better with dogs and macros and back

72
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,140
doors

73
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,208
or spreadsheets that might have macros
and them or whatever might be a charge

74
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,120
is great targets

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,670
we've heard about smoking areas where
smoking areas not only are bad for

76
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,140
company but are also bad for your help

77
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,230
we've heard about transit systems we
know that riding to work every day on a

78
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,760
bus

79
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,489
her in a taxi here is some kinda mass
transit system somewhat clone your bad

80
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,739
someone steal your bad someone to listen
to a conference call that you're on game

81
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:10,280
day to

82
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,219
information about your company we know
social functions are bad because people

83
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:15,939
like to drink

84
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,760
people like to get intoxicated attend
talk much more openly in loud about

85
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,060
things that could be sensitive

86
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,190
I'll

87
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,420
we know that wants a tax when the road
apples are always bad things

88
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,900
don't pick up CDs or thumb drive to put
them in your computer at work because

89
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,429
also have a backdoor on your computer
right when I like lots of surveillance

90
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,770
we know that dropping cameras in place
organization someone to work or what you

91
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,340
doing some good see the PIN code for
your alarm pad

92
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,229
they can monitor activity these things
are bad too right

93
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,010
see guys heard all the stains and all
these are the talk to a social engineer

94
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,090
right

95
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,200
Co everyone's now social engineer we get
past that

96
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,729
now we can actually talk about what they
talked about

97
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:02,670
so little questionid who makes the best
social engineers

98
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,060
correct I think it's children I have a
4-year-old home

99
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,040
she's amazing social engineering she
pulls things off on me all the time that

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,600
I have no idea come from

101
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,820
I get on water all the time she's four
so

102
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,830
that I don't know what's gonna happen
when she's 14 we'll see

103
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,430
but from the time you're born these
things are ingrained in me right there

104
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,980
they you you know how to get past things
you know how to bait people united to

105
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,450
switching you know how to do

106
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,190
you know these little intricate you know
tricks to get someone to do what you

107
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,150
want to do right manipulate them

108
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,010
kids are great at certain the time
you're born you know how to be a social

109
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,849
engineer

110
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,060
so in europe you got a job you want to
work

111
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,240
maybe you got a little smarter maybe
start to learn how to you know show

112
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,880
things that work right

113
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,920
you automation comes into play people
create you know cool things like

114
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,120
no frameworks to the automation for you
whether it's you know auto pollen or

115
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,440
whether it's no social injuring
frameworks

116
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,430
know all those types of things are
really cool because someone else created

117
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,630
them and now you get a chance to run
them through some kind of a little

118
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,870
menu-driven system

119
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,020
and now you too can be a badass right a
reality

120
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,030
what these things are done just major
lazy

121
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,080
they made the entire industry lazy
because there's a poll

122
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,310
thats replaces what you would like to do
so

123
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,570
no longer do you have to go and do all
the leg work calling a slight

124
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,820
gather your email address is getting
your targets doing does that

125
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,060
sending your attack to someone all these
things are built into some kinda

126
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,150
framework for your

127
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,320
frameworks a great but in reality they
make people lazy

128
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,500
right agree code

129
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,580
so you decided that these frameworks are
awesome

130
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,669
you're my guy uses framework gonna take
it into the workplace I'm gonna show my

131
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,400
boss that I'm

132
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,229
you know one bad dude because I can
clone gmail I can show you how a passer

133
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,410
could be madder

134
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,920
tab nah dinner clickjacking or whatever
in the latest attack is for whatever

135
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,470
framework you might be using

136
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,270
to take these things to work in show
your boss and you probably use Gmail the

137
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,469
demo because everyone likes to use Gmail
just like everyone likes to use 00 267

138
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,710
for their pent-up demand right

139
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,710
so you take these things the work and
all the sudden you're a rockstar

140
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,719
right we're both looking at you one i've
seen these things happen a hundred times

141
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,350
I have no idea what the value is in the
Sun confused right

142
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,730
San out your boss is there and you
explain to them that

143
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,840
fishing is really bad because I showed
up to clone Jean Auguste your passwords

144
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,130
but in reality they're confused they
have no idea what the value was behind

145
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,500
this kind of testing

146
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,380
Sol the Sun all these things are out of
alignment you have no idea

147
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,880
how to even go about showing value to
your boss or your organization or maybe

148
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,280
you're climbing gear consultant

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,780
because they're confused they see all
these demos all these frameworks all

150
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
this automation

151
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,900
and I think how am I going to you know
even protect myself against these kinds

152
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,099
of attacks because

153
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,310
they're going to happen users are gonna
clicks of users like to hear the little

154
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,640
button to click click click

155
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,659
and all the sudden their shells on their
on their systems so

156
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,950
the the organization look at it go well
if this is going to happen

157
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,640
how do I fix that how to protect myself
against it and everything's confused

158
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:00,960
right

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,880
they have no idea where the value is
behind this kinda testing up

160
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,040
but a reality these things are happening
out there in the real world right

161
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,970
in these are statistics from from q1 and
carry the number up there but it's like

162
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,380
forty some thousand phishing sites were
detected

163
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,330
and the sad part is the highest number
phishing sites are detected are here in

164
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,289
the US

165
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,910
not China not russia not you know all
these little third world countries that

166
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,640
you hear about that are attacking us

167
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,669
the US every time you see this is this

168
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,800
fishing report says statistics come out
it's always the US's be in the

169
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,159
the hotbed for all the facts the flights
all these activities so

170
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,639
it's happening right here in the field
it's happening right here in our own

171
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,750
backyard

172
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,458
but companies don't know how to address
that they're confused because

173
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,589
all these different things are happening
you guys are going into show and I'm hey

174
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,730
these things are really tax years in
automation framework to show you how to

175
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,370
Qantas like grab a password how do we
protect against these things are asking

176
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,589
all these questions may have no answers

177
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:59,009
so what's the right way to fix this well
in reality

178
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:03,180
which should be talking to your business
about work if your console to clients is

179
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,349
the only way to actually address these
issues as go through proper testing

180
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,350
Matt the vanilla testing of you know
here's me cloning OWA site or webmail

181
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,259
site or our Internet portal:

182
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:15,839
and doing some with passwords but get
past those things

183
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,310
show them that even though these attacks
are occurring every day

184
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,719
how's it affect your bottom line which
is how you are in revenue for your

185
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,529
company right

186
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,529
if you guys make widgets if you yourself
something

187
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:30,100
how does a fish impact the bottom line
but organization

188
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,389
so the problem that we see a lot of
times

189
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,319
is companies are going to the wrong kind
of testing you guys are promising that

190
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,579
with anything that you talk about

191
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:40,930
they were built within this industry if
you have the wrong kind of testing the

192
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,489
wrong answers come out that testing

193
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,009
and although some the organization has
no idea what the value is behind the

194
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:46,250
contest in

195
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,920
so the problem that we see a lot of
times is is not so much that the

196
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,240
companies are confused

197
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,259
is they're receiving the wrong kind of
service and if they're not gonna wreck a

198
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,129
service that on the right answers

199
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,839
try to fix these problems so let's talk
about what some others tests are and how

200
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,560
things are occurring today in the
industry was broken with the right

201
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,239
so here sell traditional fishing occurs
which

202
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,240
pretty obvious some pretty bleak night
and

203
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,399
that's the way we can to see this
industry is it sees cookie-cutter type

204
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,529
attacks its

205
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:19,499
he scanned exploits as he scanned in a
framework type attacks

206
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:22,949
and the companies are receiving this
kind of service but there's really no

207
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:25,139
answers come out a bit they don't see
the value in it

208
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,949
there's no impact on testing there's no
no value derived from the kind of

209
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,569
testing that they're getting

210
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:34,998
this was actually a real and I took
about a month ago all my life and I were

211
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,360
driving around and saw that in a parking
lot

212
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,860
totally legit looking right pretty
scared

213
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,040
sexually real service from what I
understand so

214
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,019
the proper judicial fishing right is

215
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,819
consultants internal organizations are
having their own red team's test them

216
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,240
whatever might be

217
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,370
their diagnosing themselves with their
own problems right

218
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,589
so if they going contract someone
actually do this kind of testing

219
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:03,050
they're given in the answers before they
start to give them a list to email

220
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,949
addresses they tell them to attack
between eight o'clock in five o'clock it

221
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,689
has to be shut down by five

222
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:10,709
and all they care about is how many
users click the link

223
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:14,619
and so the tester kisses information
ahead a time they build their official

224
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,259
something on it a framework

225
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,230
they send out this fish the hope that
works they have to get past the printer

226
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,889
filters where it might be

227
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,060
the tractor metrics they generate some
kind of audit report

228
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,800
and they sent an invoice and that's it
so it's the same vanilla test that we

229
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,240
see over and over

230
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,019
that companies don't understand what the
value is and how they fix the state's

231
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:33,509
it's this

232
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,930
automated typeof I'll you know test and
report mentality versus showing them

233
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,079
what the impact is

234
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,199
if a real attack does occur

235
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,339
so let's talk about how to get past the
vanilla test an active step it up and

236
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:46,730
and

237
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,610
show you what with the big boys do it
right with the big companies are

238
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,420
actually going to this kind of testing

239
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,870
you know whether its monthly quarterly
annually whatever might be

240
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,490
what did they are receiving how did they
get value out this contested

241
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,230
so the right way to do it is something
like this which

242
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,170
in all honesty that place that so many
Bates and traps

243
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,769
and trap doors and Canaries and
everything you could think of

244
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,860
for you know social engineering types
the taxes he was a master at

245
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,759
um so it but what

246
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,949
as a going up so how it should really be
done is

247
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,420
testing these different components when
your by when is someone from a a social

248
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,719
insurance rep respective

249
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,970
when we do a phishing attack we look at
it from multiple perspectives

250
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,439
perimeter defense once I get into Excel
data

251
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:36,899
what kinda in mine detection do you have
what kinda reporting mechanisms do you

252
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,930
have for mister response capability

253
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,709
all these like to thank should be
involved when you do some kind of social

254
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,160
engineering to gauge mint

255
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,660
if I'm going to send a fish to a
customer I don't necessarily care about

256
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,050
how many people clicked it

257
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,779
I care that we're going to impact the
calls the business if someone does click

258
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:51,490
it

259
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,490
because in all reality if you does your
organization the right way

260
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,779
and one machine is compromised it should
mean the end

261
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,819
I'll your your company the you know the
keys to the kingdom should result from

262
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,420
one compromised host

263
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,479
and that's the problem that we see a lot
of this is that we assess

264
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,999
is internal defenses are so weak that
one compromise host

265
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,050
means keys to the kingdom typically it
takes us

266
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,229
you know a matter of minutes was a
compromise one machine the game

267
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,089
privileged access an organization affect
their bottom line

268
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,790
that's not the right way to build a
company and it's that you know the same

269
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,629
analogy people used for years

270
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:28,089
where a company is you know is hardened
and

271
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,879
in a protected me outside the soft and
chewy on the inside and at the same goes

272
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,329
for Wilmer dewing fission

273
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:37,309
a lot of times once we got past the
premier defense or inside

274
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:40,930
all these other areas ball pretty
quickly because the right controls

275
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,638
weathers technical or process

276
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,209
or monitoring however might be those
things are in place

277
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,359
and were able to buy with those other
areas pretty quickly

278
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,300
so when we saw the fish the lot of
things that we will look at but most

279
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,219
importantly the want the major
components I look at is

280
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,550
how easily connects will trade et al the
business is the OP working properly

281
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,979
all the premier controls in place to see
that a large file transfers are

282
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,399
occurring over some kinda encrypted SSL
connection

283
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,009
or you know is very technology in place
to detect lateral movement from say

284
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:14,639
a workstation submit to a server summit
all these things come into play

285
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,509
when you fishing properly because in the
end the day

286
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,740
if someone is doing a fish for you once
they get inside a chance so they

287
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,639
probably are

288
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,680
after you go through this a couple times
maybe this you know you get stopped

289
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,709
but for the first couple time someone
goes through a real phishing attack

290
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,529
and they do get inside it's pretty easy
to to move around affect something

291
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,490
that's critical to the business right

292
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,470
so how well are you monitoring that
kinda movement inside the organization

293
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,920
and that's really the value that comes
out this kind of testing is once I get

294
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,529
inside how fast can you text stopping

295
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:49,699
and that's really what this point the
point is kinda services it's not

296
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:53,069
how many users cannot tricked into
clicking a link its what someone clicks

297
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:53,790
the link

298
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,849
how quickly came to detective someone
inside a moving around

299
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,040
to make that 0

300
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,550
so let's talk about how we do it some
other techniques we use and

301
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,969
know some the companies that we've gone
after for several years now they become

302
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,850
much harder

303
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,119
because they go through rigorous testing
every quarter every year so what are

304
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,610
techniques that we employ

305
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,619
to get around some others you know high
level controls they put in place now

306
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:19,790
so first before you do anything right
yet to prepare for your attack

307
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,949
and the sky is the funniest lie but now
it makes sense

308
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:26,279
when you think government attack
perspective because if someone's going

309
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,949
to attack your organization there's a
lot of things are going to be prepared

310
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:29,899
ahead of time

311
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,309
you know and from our you know from our
a consulting perspective when we're

312
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:34,389
ready to attack

313
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:37,410
there's different ways to prepare you
know you if you're going to plan to

314
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,589
attack 8 a.m. on a Monday morning then

315
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:41,839
you damn well gonna do your homework
something like to make sure all your

316
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,959
stuff is ready to go

317
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,540
payloads efficient sites for failover
all these different things are being

318
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,660
tested properly right

319
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,959
but at the same time you can prepare
yourself to be ready to go 8 a.m. in the

320
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,540
morning when you fire on Monday morning
right

321
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,199
so in reality preparation really starts
on intelligence gathering

322
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,490
you know every time you see a test on
contesting are you see a talk on

323
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,399
contesting

324
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,999
or any kind of you know assessment
services intelligence-gathering is

325
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,329
always the first step

326
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,638
and until you actually improper
intelligence-gathering you're taxing and

327
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,540
having kinda value

328
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,480
you got up gonna blow your wad because
you've you done minimal

329
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,600
intelligence-gathering you've collected
you know ten addresses or

330
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,170
you know ten percent about the
environment whatever might be because

331
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,139
you're short cut your

332
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:24,839
euros a place and that's going to result
in poor value for your client because

333
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,540
you haven't improper homework so before
you even do any kind active testing

334
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,059
you should go through some kind of
passive analysis the organization to

335
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:31,779
foot print them

336
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:35,290
understand what they do on how they
operate on a standard home their

337
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,089
language

338
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,089
what's going on currently with an
organization all those kinds of things

339
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:39,670
to come

340
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,170
valuable when you're designing some kind
of of social internet act

341
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,849
so what you do all that you're ready to
go ahead and and set up your fishing

342
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,999
site right

343
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:51,629
well when you create a phishing site
it's important to understand

344
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:54,769
all those things are currently happening
within the business because it may not

345
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,759
be as easy as going out buying a domain
name that might be somewhat to the

346
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,490
company

347
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,589
but maybe they just acquired a third
party business or

348
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,630
maybe they have a new marketing campaign
that's occurring whatever those things

349
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,709
might be their current for that business
that employees have seen

350
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,950
you know chatter about internally with
emails going back and forth

351
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,680
whatever might be a something relative
them currently at the time so

352
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,980
be very you know intelligent about how
you select your domain name

353
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,490
but don't take the shortcut road that we
see a lot of people do where

354
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,339
it just right obvious get it was some
kinda me know tiny URL orbit Leo

355
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,679
whatever might be because

356
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,480
chances are those things are going to
work you gonna go out spent all this

357
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,510
time is on all these cool little
features and gadgets so this fissure

358
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,430
gonna do

359
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,380
and they're gonna obvious get with some
free service and hope that someone

360
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,210
clicks a

361
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,690
to bad idea make sense to spend the 999

362
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,720
to register your site by legit the main
aim do all your homework at a time set

363
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,060
the things up that looks legitimate
right

364
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,649
but then on top of that make sure that
when you go by your domain name

365
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,240
you register your your next record
register your mailer so

366
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,270
don't try and use a third-party services
and the fish through

367
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,660
register an ex record I V mail server
make sure it's legitimate

368
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,470
so that if someone does a reverse lookup
on where the mail is coming from

369
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,960
actually passes control checks that were
gonna do

370
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,500
so chances are if you do all those
things ahead a time you purchase it a

371
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,530
legit name

372
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,100
you've registered it you register MX
record you tested your mailer

373
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,439
you'd all these different things when
the email actually gets into the target

374
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,290
its gonna clear from others initial
checks that they do but on top of that

375
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,280
what you do all your post that you
collected all these different dresses

376
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,500
validate this targets

377
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,050
we see a lot of companies fail and in
this phase above

378
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,440
the attack because they don't validate
those addresses and

379
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,020
the way that the way that we do it is
will take you know the 500-600 just we

380
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,879
collected

381
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,570
and validate this first most companies
out there the mail server or validate

382
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,200
a valid address purse is a bad address
this is helpful because

383
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,670
if I'm said in an attack at a business
and there's

384
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,350
500 dresses that I have that collected
and 202 those far

385
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,939
you know invalid no longer employees for
the company and they start failing as

386
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,080
bad recipient

387
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,110
if someone's got some kind of a learning
set up on their mail server

388
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,860
and they see all these bad address is
coming through Darren you know some kind

389
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,429
of a mass campaign

390
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,770
gonna right away the sufficient at some
was collected old stale day online

391
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,160
it now sent those as targets for their
attack and all the sudden these things

392
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,340
are not getting delivered because
they're not valid address its

393
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,970
so go through invalidate those targets
make sure their dollar dresses for you

394
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,880
and send them

395
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,230
but also it's helpful to actually do
intelligence the people you gathered

396
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,820
because the last thing I want to do is
send my tack to

397
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,879
a bunch of people that are on the IT
staff or

398
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,790
the answer spot staff for the legal
staff even illegal to go on a target

399
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,159
all these different things or are going
to get you caught more than likely

400
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,330
so go through and filter some others
addresses out to make sure that

401
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,730
I'm not gonna send by phishing attack in
the very beginning of my taxes

402
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,280
to the IT staff I want to target someone
is going to be less pretty

403
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,600
to what the security policies are or
maybe they're not as technical and/or

404
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,490
gonna click the link quicker than
someone who might be

405
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,110
you know a domain admin for the company
the screen some other things out

406
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,830
within last you know one the most
important pieces tester payloads

407
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,919
tested on mobile operating systems test
no motive multiple

408
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,410
pipe the browser's whatever you're going
to target for that particular campaign

409
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,760
make sure you tested where you stand out
you don't wanna be testing it later in

410
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,640
the field what your taxes already in the
wild

411
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,050
up another important piece of wood

412
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,300
is make sure that you clean it how many
people actually help Rockies in your

413
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,669
organization

414
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,360
do some kinda web filtering some kind of
screening inbound outbound checks

415
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,010
whatever might be with a blue coat
websites

416
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,770
a Cisco device whatever might be this is
by my favorite piece

417
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,600
so when I go by the main aim and I'm
going to target a company say about you

418
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,990
know I'm going to target people

419
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,090
I'm gonna buy the main and might be
somewhere to Google the my next up is

420
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,610
going to be

421
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,080
I'm going to set up a CNAME for the
company so now ball

422
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,399
you know it's the largest company I I'll
said by company are two main aim thats

423
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,490
you know Loor yes so I set up a CNAME

424
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,950
and I point lort estelle eres and then I
go and register that

425
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,620
website with all these different party
filtering services whether it's

426
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,139
Blue Coat websites McAfee whatever they
might have

427
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,690
and I've learned all the stains there my
intelligence gathering to find out

428
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,230
what kinda proxy have internally and
that's there's a pretty easy to find you

429
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,430
be surprised

430
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,410
coming to protect forms are out there we
can actually go and collect data about a

431
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:15,930
company

432
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,330
say okay it's also company has a blue
coat the sticker company has a websites

433
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,620
now I know the idea clean my site in
this particular nope

434
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,649
proxy clear before I even some the
target so

435
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,520
take your website set up a CNAME summit
at the Blue Coat

436
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,810
file it as you know I e-commerce site or
whatever that paper company is here

437
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,340
talking to you file a category that's
four

438
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,560
you submit they then go into a scrape on
that service

439
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,530
pretty quickly be surprised I've seen
blue coat within a matter of five

440
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,030
minutes

441
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,180
inspect the site and approve it as you
know a new e-commerce like this paper

442
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,060
company

443
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,090
so the beauty behind that is if I buy
domain

444
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,590
i've seen a man to the word legitimate
site I submit a blue coat blue coat hits

445
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,090
ago still in a slight

446
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,209
I've never had a simple website
whatsoever allied with CNN

447
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,250
now my new fishing the main its claim
for Blue Coat Websense whatever it might

448
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,860
be

449
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,760
now I know it's going to pass those
controls my son did make sense

450
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,850
and that's just a short summary is
obviously you know twenty different

451
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,550
kinds of rock is out there

452
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,889
we've got a laundry list of all the
URL's actual submit those but

453
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,010
does apply the most common one so you
guys are had a chance to take those down

454
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,100
as ago was a similar sites to before you
attack

455
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,959
architecture we talk about this or that
before um important piece here

456
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,510
is having failover I can't tell you how
many times that we've we've been

457
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:40,020
involved during an attack and you know
us a system becomes unstable

458
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,780
they received too many shells Metasploit
you know craps itself

459
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,180
whatever might be in a failover have
secondary is ready

460
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,130
have new IP's ready be able to roll to a
new IP if they block your IP

461
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,700
have all those things test in a raid ago
a case something does happen during your

462
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,470
tax base

463
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,690
we need to roll quickly because you
don't lose your access the win over

464
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,860
exposure is pretty short know when to
attack is pretty short

465
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,919
when you're doing fishing it's a big
organization I

466
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,870
a lot of times the identify the campaign
pretty quickly but the mass campaign

467
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,959
spearfishing is a bit longer to detect
sometimes about the chances are that

468
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,950
once they detect this message campaigns

469
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,630
gonna start blocking eyepiece so make
sure you architecture sopra police that

470
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,290
you guys

471
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,879
have the ability to roll to new sites
new servers new listeners whatever it

472
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,110
might be

473
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,320
and of course everyone wants the metrics
right everyone wants to know

474
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,710
out of 5 where users how many people
click the link so when the easiest ways

475
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,470
to do that

476
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,620
is just have a session ID variable on
your fish you're all that you use

477
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,969
and here the example that music here
that we did for a long time is just a

478
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,980
base64 encoded version love

479
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,910
the email address so for example you
know he's mad at large dot com would be

480
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,970
that they 64 encoded string

481
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,260
so every time I send that my fish out

482
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,050
every target so unique session ID within
the fish URL

483
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,340
because the primary part in the fish URL
acclaimed domain within your proxy

484
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,429
it's not going to allow those things
through but it makes it very easy for me

485
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,300
later as a consultant the generators
reports say

486
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,460
here's ever you are all they had two
hundred and the Apache logs

487
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,600
and then I can go back and deco dollars
you know basically 40 ko tum

488
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,010
say here's all the valid address is
actually right click the link

489
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,110
so it's really easy for me to say all
the five hundred years is that targeted

490
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,050
here's a hundred at the click the link
and here's the actual email address for

491
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,399
theirs was a click the link

492
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,800
so pretty easy you know in poor man's
way of tracking phishing attacks

493
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,250
in so metrics are awesome but

494
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,480
it's really about going after the bottom
line right what makes the company took

495
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,400
how they operate how they make money how
do you affect their bottom line when you

496
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,120
attack them

497
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,979
and that's really what this type of
service is supposed to be about not the

498
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,210
problem this industry we see a lot of
times is

499
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,360
they're all about capturing the metrics
and in the report out that's the can

500
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,389
send an invoice

501
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,970
they're not there still is showing how
do you affect the bottom line the

502
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,610
company

503
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,959
so let's talk about somebody's these
expert techniques or what I like to call

504
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,130
masturbating

505
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,440
I'll and we'll go through a couple above
scenarios what we like to do for fishing

506
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,670
techniques

507
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,730
actually had a different flight and
there but we had a sanitize it for a

508
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,110
for a couple conference itself that
money went all

509
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,679
the first technique that that we like to
use call live bait fishing or netting

510
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,770
and this once great because I like the
target

511
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,389
you know webmail portals how many
companies out there that you guys were

512
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,050
four have

513
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,820
OWA or other types webmail expose the
internet was single factor

514
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,570
you can say if you want to know you have
them I've seen them already

515
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,689
so audio is great a load anyway the
awesome place to target

516
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,530
nine times out of ten companies don't
monitor failed logins very much

517
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,280
expression OWA so we like the target is
when I'll portals if I get a chance to

518
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,490
get a note on the way

519
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,280
there's a lot of cool chicks I can use
insider the way we'll talk about here

520
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,889
those but

521
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,810
that's just one example like to use it
cuz it's you know the most common

522
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,470
everyone knows what'll be way is right

523
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,770
a liquid access go so if I see all the
way

524
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,010
a target that hybrid I get a valid login

525
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,590
and now and don't all the users so

526
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,750
previously and all birds OWA 2003 and
sometimes 2007

527
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,200
we actually had the ability to download
the address list

528
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,790
but in 2010 the change that so there's
another call way

529
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,010
that you can do it and if you guys are
from a wood burning car proxy

530
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,810
you can trap the request went with
indicated into OWA

531
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,320
now the with indicated after you get the
about formal request that you look

532
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,179
someone up you know you can say find
someone you look someone up in the

533
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,800
actual

534
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,530
address list with no the way the trap
that request

535
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,530
there's a record return variable that's
in there you see highlighted their

536
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,950
Sr you can't wrap their request a brew
that and I bring that you then get

537
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:44,080
a fit value never want to request with
5202 that the army times you can commit

538
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,949
that request and you can double the
e-mail address add to that

539
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,380
What's Up Girl your email address is now
I have new email address to send to

540
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,870
but out that username to target their an
additional brute forcing so

541
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,959
old anyways a great place to get initial
hook

542
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,060
don't data and gather more information
about the company

543
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,379
you can also do other cultures or the
way like find out what kind of you know

544
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,900
corporate campaign they have

545
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,560
or you know what's going on internally
at that time to get people's calendars

546
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,820
you can book your calendars a backdoor
some macros attachments

547
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,770
logical things you can do with auto to
beware but cool part about the sticker

548
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,750
technique is

549
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,500
I can gain more data about your company
more email addresses more target

550
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,070
information for phone numbers like a
pretext against

551
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,530
whatever might be I can gain information
is by having one dollar counter W ed

552
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,740
so what I have to do. access and you
probably have a single factor VPN

553
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,540
now can login to VPN the beauty %uh VPN
typically is

554
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,850
you spent all this money of the picture
in there so

555
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,490
you spend all this money protecting the
front door you've got

556
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,720
two factor authentication maybe you've
got some kind IPS for IDS

557
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,470
you've got you know strong
authentication complex passwords

558
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,210
all these are things you put in place on
your perimeter but in reality

559
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,940
what and you may have an active but in
reality 1 subbed connected with the

560
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,470
piano

561
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,200
got around all those controls you spend
all this money on because typically VPN

562
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,980
drop UN

563
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,700
right on the internal subnet so all
these in

564
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,210
your technology in controls and
processes a monitoring all the things

565
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,190
you spent boo boo about the money on

566
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,660
got past all those a one dollar count
externally I want to visit your site

567
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,760
and of the Comintern all out the point
you're not working try to do Mac

568
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,530
filtering and I D S and you know I P S
and you know nap bypass and certificate

569
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,320
authentication all these different
things

570
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,580
because I've got on your VP at Sobotka
all those controls

571
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,060
so that's the beauty of kitten access
externally especially when you gain

572
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,690
access someone's bpm

573
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,200
so the next technique that that I like
the most selfish in the middle

574
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,550
we can agree to that one internally but
it makes sense when you understand we're

575
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,409
talking about here

576
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,730
so a gain access to view it

577
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,840
then find a conversation between
stallion Jim

578
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,959
Anderson in a spreadsheet back and forth
gain access that conversation

579
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,120
take the spreadsheet download it blog it
put a macro it take the PDF backdoor

580
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
whatever might be

581
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,520
engage directly into the conversation so
now I've inserted myself between

582
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,129
their active conversation than it had
minutes ago above this attachment

583
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,400
someone from the air with it's credible
they open the previously

584
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,620
in our recent them they open it they
have no idea that

585
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,189
you know jim's account was compromised
and he just reset the same attache

586
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,920
minutes ago

587
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,260
and all this on his machine is
compromised so

588
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,590
we try this on a client and we said

589
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,990
they received it and then we get this
email back that says we see an email and

590
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,920
other inbox and

591
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,230
something's not working so we look into
our like alright what's going on here

592
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,280
we find out after replying back to this
response

593
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,980
and delete the email that we're doing it
because we're inside this compromise the

594
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,960
help

595
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,400
we find out there on a 64-bit ship
within tested properly

596
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,170
so when we do we go into developer mode
right there in milan attack

597
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,270
not only do we have a ballad attack fish
on the line

598
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,000
she's engaged opening attachments we
bought it with back toward it

599
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,620
now so we have a problem so well when I
coworkers Chris gates

600
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,169
as well as our date County like us know
him I'll

601
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,420
we were together for a matter of minutes
we figured out there is an issue 64 bit

602
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,800
shocker with macros

603
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,399
Dave whipped up a quick little script
call unicorn were able to trump the data

604
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,500
and within made a new back door

605
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,940
recent back to the check again she that
opens it

606
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,840
and she says okay it opened but now
receiving a slow macro warning

607
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,760
like sweet it worked sure go ahead no
problem click it

608
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,690
so we're doing all this with a
compromise the Cal and obviously these

609
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,840
the motherland someone inbox a person
from the computer

610
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,050
Solly we have to respond quickly will
have a deadly emails the case you were

611
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,389
doing

612
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,770
so we figured out he opens it we get
chill works

613
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:55,139
so that's actually out you guys can find
a unicorn on gates blog carnage

614
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,430
as well as dave has it on his are just a
sec blog as well

615
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,790
so another call technique that we like
to use call side channels

616
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,850
and side channels a great because
chances are that attackers

617
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,209
is manipulating you into cooking some
tile Inc they got

618
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,380
active communication with you even
gauges a conversation

619
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,300
chances are they're not gonna go from
email to some other means of

620
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,060
communication

621
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,940
I call you on the phone they're not
gonna text you so if someone's going to

622
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,990
do that

623
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,670
chances are you going to believe it
you're going to think it's the helpdesk

624
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,460
gonna think it's someone that you work
with

625
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,910
because china's not gonna go from a
email to a phone call

626
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,790
but this doesn't happen right so we like
to use the side channels to build more

627
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,620
credibility

628
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,040
but also lower than into doing more
things maybe they're getting tired to

629
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,700
respond back and forth emails

630
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,350
may be there they're catching on what
we're doing and they decided not to cook

631
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,459
anymore links

632
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,560
but you get on the phone nine times out
of ten you can get them to do more

633
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,590
things because now you can gauge when

634
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,230
actively on the phone you can walk them
through Cup for some kind of attack

635
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,950
and you can lure him into doing more
things which can also do some other

636
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,490
things we talked about previously like

637
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,810
evaluating why something might not be
working so

638
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:05,970
it make sense sometimes too go further
in your attack but

639
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,870
the valuable on this as well as company
spent a lotta time

640
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,469
educating users of fishing they don't
talk a lot about free texting

641
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,160
they talk a lot about how to protect if
someone calls you on the fall

642
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,270
or how to protect if someone sends you a
malicious text

643
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,790
so keep those things in mind when you're
educating your uses internally

644
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,379
but also when you or coworkers might be
getting attacked

645
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,880
or your console that you're attacking
use these techniques to gain further

646
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,690
access

647
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,160
lure them into revealing more
information whatever it might be

648
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,960
less technique political chumming cling
this is my favorite so

649
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,130
a lot of times you want to create some
kind diversion

650
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,180
so we'll send a mass fish campaign
knowing that it's going to get detected

651
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,170
knowing that are going to send some
kinda response they're gonna alert I

652
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,870
gotta say

653
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,199
you know all the sudden this you know
this attack came in at 9am this morning

654
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,810
there was a URL that look like

655
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,860
OWA they ask you to click it login
reveal your password

656
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,520
if you receive this e-mail then you know
what helped us know immediately

657
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,030
so you do these things intentionally to
generate some kind of %uh activity or

658
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,720
chatter inside the company

659
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,730
so that's the charm part so you a
further spots

660
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,980
this is an example one response we have
a client and it was a legitimate

661
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,010
response from there

662
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,690
their support staffer I our team
whatever might be same this

663
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,170
email came in previously and it was you
know an attack and we've

664
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,340
in a sense then responded and we'd all
these types of things

665
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,560
you wait for that response what their
response comes and

666
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,450
you bring in the cleaner so with the
cleaner

667
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,990
what you do as you use their response to
attack them further

668
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,750
a lot I'm just pisses clients of to be
careful because we have phone call for

669
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,120
clients call go

670
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,699
okay we know you said this fish earlier
today but was the second one you also

671
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,880
like year well where you gonna stop

672
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,620
like what you pay for full-day attacks
or give you a full day of an attack

673
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,969
so you 10 a ruffle some feathers some
time that way but

674
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,190
keep the things I'm on a good show it is
a client of that pay the invoice

675
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,440
or if you're doing internally on Tisha
boss of but

676
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,259
years that first peacetime attack to
build your second tier right

677
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:16,219
now you've got the second attack and the
good part about this from a tax

678
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,859
perspective is

679
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:22,639
the user is already in ownage they know
they receive this e-mail with the click

680
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,749
it or not whether the end

681
00:34:23,748 --> 00:34:27,928
insert their data whether they you know
did with the email told them to do

682
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:31,629
now their own edge and they feel bad and
there what to do something to remedy the

683
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:33,098
situation

684
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:36,639
this is where the cleaner comes in he
said you were suspect you were

685
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,669
you know target you did this this and
this you need to do this now to fix your

686
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:41,498
stuff

687
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:45,029
any some another link 47 execute a ble
recent amino

688
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:48,569
a spreadsheet or a PDF for whatever
might be they're gonna jump on it

689
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:51,768
because they want to help but the
problem is they're doing it

690
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:56,149
for a malicious actor so those things
come in nice when

691
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,410
you wanna go further and you want to
generate some kind of noise

692
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,170
because chances are as you start do
anything for clients over time

693
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,400
they're going to get very good at
detecting mass fish campaigns

694
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,599
but they're gonna fail at doing targeted
phishing so

695
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:13,809
desert are great ways to show them that
they can still be

696
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:16,999
you know still be victim to amass vision
campaign that might be

697
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:21,058
two or three layers deep not just 71
hope someone clicks at

698
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:24,190
makes up

699
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,220
so let's talk about dealing with a sore
spots

700
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,279
because that's always you know this the
next phase what you've done the site

701
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:34,339
attack if Center fish some with click
the link someone's engage

702
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:37,740
and now is the response is involved

703
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,439
the way we like to play when is a
response to see if those things are

704
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,390
actually working properly because
remember back to the pyramid I showed

705
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,220
you

706
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,288
this is one component of what a proper
phishing attack should be

707
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:50,519
powers I are engaged power they cut you
know

708
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:54,758
how they define how they monitoring how
they're responding to their user base

709
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:59,099
so were things that we like to do is
before we must send out

710
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,279
any kind of attack we have a list of
what addresses can't talk to our our

711
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:04,400
fishing site

712
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,569
and they might be SunGard SecureWorks

713
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:11,650
all these third-party MSS is that your
you guys probably ellsworth to

714
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,249
and they do your monitoring for you if
we know the IP space

715
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:19,240
they can inspect our site so what's
blocking was not allow them to even

716
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,430
access our site

717
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,890
to the name I have to cover my Comcast
IP space or roadrunner or time-warner

718
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,220
block all that too and if you really
want to grain or whether

719
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,459
whitelist only the IP space for the
quiet now no one else can inspect your

720
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,039
site

721
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,359
no one else can pull down your payloads
and someone gap afforded to them it is

722
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,009
somehow offline analysis

723
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,579
it gives you more time for your your
window attack so white with all that

724
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,140
stuff for blacklisted however you want
to do it

725
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,910
while the other cool things we like to
do that really pisses the quiet of the

726
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,339
%uh be careful with this

727
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:52,749
is when they come from an investigation
I P whether it's SecureWorks or you know

728
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:54,209
other MSS is ur

729
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:59,059
you know Comcast space however might be
if that IP space hit your website

730
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:02,410
redirect them back to their corporate
site dumas to rewrite

731
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,440
send it back to the corporate site and
now all the sudden they think the corpus

732
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,049
I got infected

733
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:10,950
and some was attacking them from their
old up now they're awful lot use chase

734
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,788
inspecting some that doesn't exist

735
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:16,049
gives you more time for your attack so
the waterways you can play the game with

736
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:18,279
a cat mouse if they're trying to
investigation

737
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:21,539
and buy you more time and the reality of
what you're doing here you're buying

738
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,759
yourself more time

739
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:26,480
see you have more exposure over glad
when you to gain access to what's

740
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,210
important and what makes that doesn't
stick

741
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:33,190
that the other day as we're trying to
show how do you think the bottom line

742
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,960
but you're getting real call on your cat
techniques right be careful

743
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,890
this is bit us in the butt a few times
ISP abuse alerts

744
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,680
client doesn't know that you're
attacking them maybe it's a full black

745
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,578
box

746
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:49,970
zero knowledge test and they decide that
this particular IP is malicious

747
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,399
and they reported what is the ISP do

748
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,509
shut it down or if you do like

749
00:37:56,509 --> 00:38:00,470
I admit that I did years ago you do it
from your home lab

750
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,058
unit home to shut down I gotta roll over
to a tethering connection to get back

751
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:07,039
and screen OS into your cloud boxes
where it might be

752
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,869
so keep those things in mind that they
might get your internet turned off

753
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,099
they might get your website drop your
cloud provider might drop your note for

754
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:14,779
a minute

755
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:18,240
those things could happen so that goes
back to the architecture peace

756
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,089
there's a chance that stuff might get
shut down because you don't necessarily

757
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:22,240
on that box

758
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,038
that connection and if that happens be
prepared to roll over something else

759
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,619
but also be prepared that authorities
might show up at your house

760
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,799
not admitting that happen but they could
happen so

761
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:37,920
keep those things in mind when you're
gonna be the attacker that authorities

762
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,079
could you call

763
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,200
if there's something in your rules of
engagement with your client this issue

764
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,470
going to maintain active communication
with them

765
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,129
make sure you follow the arleigh let
them know that you're attacking this pic

766
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,089
or space

767
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:52,269
is being investigated you've seen these
IP's connect to it

768
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:55,390
keep those calms open if it's for black
box

769
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,640
stay quiet do as much as you can know
the AM I get turned off

770
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,499
or someone might investigate yep

771
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:06,149
a lot of time he might get hurt
sometimes hopefully not a lot of times

772
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,660
you might have to be involved in some
kind of legal counsel for corporation

773
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,879
and this was good because we buy a lot
of domains

774
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,970
we register log remains we get them
clean and and proxies and things like

775
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,319
that before even attack

776
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:22,200
but there are laws out there that say
that you can't go by its particular

777
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,160
domain name

778
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,519
this on for example was FedEx delivery
or something like that

779
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:31,149
we are contacted shortly after that it's
a legal apparently to buy the main in

780
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,549
the has

781
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:35,980
FedEx and the domain so legal counsel
contact us and asked us to Cali get the

782
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,390
name back

783
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,640
can't tell you when we get back or not
so those things could happen legal

784
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,509
counsel to contact you

785
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:48,210
this was my favorite this one is legal
counsel for edible arrangements

786
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:51,700
or 10 at a boring dresses been around
for a while now

787
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,210
so I'm costly getting email from edible
arrangements some one hundred Flowers &

788
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,359
flights like this

789
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:03,038
around holidays and things like that the
run is a car promotion for July 4th in a

790
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,289
bouquet of flowers whatever might be

791
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:08,769
so I decided edible arrangements might
be a great domain

792
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:12,618
to purchase to use the party
organizations around the holidays

793
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:16,109
around in a corporate functions they
might have whatever it might be

794
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:20,069
so I decide to purchase edible
arrangements with him ints in a penny

795
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,619
ante s

796
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,230
well they didn't like the fact that
about the name but what really pissed

797
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:25,999
him off

798
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:29,269
was what about the demesne I set up the
CNAME pointed at

799
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:33,769
to one hundred Flowers so when they
started doing investigation

800
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:36,828
they thought what a hundred flowers had
bought the domain and try to steal their

801
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:37,599
business

802
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,970
and I work for one hundred Flowers so
turn into a huge mess

803
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,098
lawyers and everyone else had to get
involved in it was a pain in the ass

804
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:47,660
so keep those days in mind when you're
buying domains that

805
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,328
legal counsel might get involved

806
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:54,430
so obviously

807
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,450
be an attacker you're gonna get better
as time goes along in a damn good at

808
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,819
doing these attacks

809
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:03,769
there's gonna be times when ethics there
come into play

810
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:07,258
and you might get a situation like this
where

811
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:10,730
couple years ago New York and they
probably still the same issue now the

812
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,130
stop talking about it much

813
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,499
New York at a bad problem with that box
their bed bug infestations all over

814
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:17,359
Manhattan

815
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,700
all over you know proper New York City
so

816
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,439
there were notifications that we're
going up costly about different areas

817
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,289
they had that both infestations

818
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:28,400
so we decided that because there was a
particular client New York

819
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,989
we within our own notification about
that box and we made up the entire

820
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,369
email bball you know in Musina fire
whatever the name was

821
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:39,299
and we specifically listed areas around

822
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:44,509
the company's office address that all
these places were infested with bedbugs

823
00:41:44,509 --> 00:41:48,009
so the attack worked we got shells we
got in

824
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:51,759
but the bad part was they decide if for
someone internally for that you know the

825
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,309
CDC

826
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:56,819
well because whoever worked at CDC was a
very technical

827
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:00,499
they decide to click the link also so

828
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:05,578
goes back to ethics be very careful
sometimes you receive out a ban shells

829
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,960
that may not be under the contact you
have with your particular client

830
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,299
so keep those things in mind that
sometimes your tax a really good

831
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:16,589
and you might get things are out of
scope

832
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:20,359
another great was here um we decided on
the

833
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:24,170
and have you ever lived in your city or
visited pled

834
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,960
the transit systems in New York and New
Jersey are notorious for not offering

835
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,170
any country funds

836
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,239
you spend money you get screwed whatever
you of the money

837
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,309
no refunds whatsoever we decided by a
domain that was gonna offer refunds for

838
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:38,970
the transit system

839
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,459
went to client all the use internally
thought was the greatest thing ever once

840
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,960
I never registered and gave us their
personal information and passwords and

841
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,059
whatever else but the problem was

842
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:53,549
a big bank in New York City also decided
to click the link because someone

843
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:56,359
internally for that to someone else that
worked at a bank

844
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:59,430
so again keep those things in mind if
you're

845
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:03,019
attacks are very good very authentic and
you've done all your proper home or

846
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,738
getting things passed premier controls

847
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:09,319
someone's going to for that email it's
gonna go outside the boundary that

848
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,359
organization

849
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:13,788
and chances are someone from another
company maybe big bank

850
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:17,549
is going to click the link sometimes you
gotta kill their shells

851
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:22,749
so keep those things Ahmad but what this
all boils down to the right is

852
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:25,999
social engineering is is one component
of demonstrating impact to get the

853
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:27,189
business

854
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,160
and when we demonstrate impact we like
to use multiple avenues of attack

855
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,420
whether it's physical social elektronik
or blend of those things

856
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,539
so if you wanna distract demonstrate
impact the right way

857
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:42,549
you walk in you smash in Houston what
you need to steal and you walk out

858
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:45,999
and that's the way you do if you wanna
do a proper but what it really boils

859
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,769
down to is reading testing

860
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:52,238
and that's what we're all about so write
your sys-con example rating testing is

861
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:53,819
what blended threats are seen as

862
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,940
and the way that operates is if

863
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,739
I want to attack your company I might do
my elektronik analysis first

864
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:04,539
I'm I gain access externally I might get
in the a social engineering am I getting

865
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:05,400
the a fishing

866
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,470
I'm I get India direct export externally

867
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,488
or maybe I got looking up the pop an
account the other the way I gotta be a

868
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:12,539
VPN

869
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:16,319
but once I'm n I don't stop there i
graph your bad system

870
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,460
what I had a bad system not been
physically make badges for your company

871
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,210
or maybe I can remotely open doors and I
can't physically visit your company

872
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,420
I can walk in a plugin internally or can
physically still stuff

873
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,210
and all those things come into blender
thread attacks we're social physical

874
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,890
electronic overlap

875
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,200
and once you start combining those
things will be able to demonstrate

876
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,629
impact much more to your company

877
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,700
or your client to your consult message

878
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:39,950
thank you
