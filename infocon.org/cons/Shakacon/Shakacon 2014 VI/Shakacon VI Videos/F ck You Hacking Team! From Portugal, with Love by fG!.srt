1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,649
your twenty dollars be with us here %um

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,990
pretty awesome haha obviously all things
like great

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,420
up getting back on its research in
updates

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,000
pretty cool stuff so all it's all it's
going to start so stay on track and I

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,090
get more of a lot of time thinking while

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,740
thank you

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,519
so welcome to these lovely tie
self-presentation

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,480
fuck you I can tame the reason is
because I don't like these guys and I

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,980
will try to present to you

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,150
reversing of their mall where the my
question they've been on the news on the

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,949
past two days of all this stuff

12
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:49,480
because it isn't allowed release their
reports with some internal documents

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,819
and reversing of Android and I US
samples so these guys are

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,330
quite same as and the I don't like their
where my

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,129
first roll don't follow me on twitter a
fuel

16
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:05,440
want to have a happy life and I'm a
troll make am i were always

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,670
trolling people and just making fun of
stuff

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,940
I am because I i like it and just like
to experiment with a the human brain

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,020
I'm trying to write the with kids smoke
we're together with Nemo ensnare

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,030
Yahoo Patrick yesterday he mentions

21
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,790
their name always one of them most and
one of the best guys and Mac

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,580
and

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,580
saying he is older than me in the max
and I just have a Mac

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,390
just bottom it's max seven years ago is
over and then drink

25
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,450
primary school simply covert the right
that's

26
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,550
as doctor that I'm trying to develop a
security solution for Mac OS

27
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,810
and the best worked in banking and
causing

28
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,390
doing research disclaimer

29
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,680
this whole slight homemakers pic

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,619
whole Tolka are probably a conference
the discussion about 20 days

31
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,290
government spyware and and so on I'm not
the

32
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,330
against about this the the problem is
that

33
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,359
there's no definition of bad guys if you
look at the report from cities and

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,500
an hour away they're selling the stuff
to a very shaky governments

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,450
so we don't know really anything about
this and this is my

36
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,940
problem with these guys reactivated

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,940
ever nothing personal against them I
guess the type of business as I told you

38
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,620
if they were marked perspire

39
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,810
I will be okay I'm just shooting the
messenger

40
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,690
the because they had only samples I know
for Mac OS there's also another portion

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,500
with the

42
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,970
which is fine Fisher for Mac OS the
moment I find things Fisher because no

43
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,269
one as the sample

44
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,570
I will go after Kingfisher and holy
fucking team

45
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,120
Russell I will show you that they are
not that smart

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,519
and have no respect for hard and I'm not
a

47
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,630
some not so much respect because of
these

48
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,090
and this presentation is the 206

49
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,250
lights so I cannot present to rethink
and these will be it became a reference

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,799
for you

51
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,260
you are interested in reversing Mac
stuff there you can use it as a

52
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,269
consulting for forced through are not
three use it to reverse

53
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,530
and Mac stuff with second-tier

54
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,040
just a brief overview these guys they
say that they provide an easy to use

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,439
offensive technology

56
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,310
to law enforcement and intelligence
communities

57
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,030
our technologies is a they lead to
fights crime

58
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,050
gained six continents and this is my
favorite slaying of the talk other than

59
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,900
rather than the title

60
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,049
its bush's and why this is wishful
thinking

61
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,250
the they cannot really control well they
sell to

62
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,340
you see these in real arms see it

63
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,099
in Burgos to Iran and the CRN can still
buy stuff

64
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,470
and you have a whole history of the
stuff server stuff

65
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,769
it's just bits and bytes Healy to and to
move around so

66
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,950
they cannot to handle these as I told
you this dubious clientele

67
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,548
buying this stuff there's no
transparency in the process

68
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,390
I told them I ve NHA

69
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,769
they follow me on Twitter and I told
every school once invited me to go to me

70
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,980
I have no problem we we can be friends

72
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,220
no problem with these but I'm the
mortars birds

73
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,870
tell me tall wiry something for I don't
want your business to Prince

74
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,850
I just want to set that when they're
sent wire sawing through some guarantees

75
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,620
that you are not selling true us

76
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,280
term the software to make really bad
stuff protect political dissidents and

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,739
all that kind of stuff if you are
addressing the

78
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,910
review reports the last one to post
story is the one released two days ago

79
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,110
and that is making a big splash Honda

80
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,910
meals crisis what's crisis

81
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,900
crazy is the name of the mall where them
on my person of the mall where

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,179
socially it's what they call the remote
control system

83
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,270
it's the system that the sale for $200k

84
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,229
which it was the price that we know
about this it's officially sold as da

85
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,820
Vinci

86
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,980
the we have samples for Windows the my

87
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,930
family now I O S and Android there was a

88
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,210
presentation last year on our economy
about the Windows version

89
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,340
idea done by Kaspersky reverse it may
cause a police

90
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,010
if you don't publish the slights maybe
one day we will publish

91
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,610
he's portion of the wheels there there's
a need for some valuable

92
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,930
cold going well the I don't have samples
about these I will show we'll some

93
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,169
some theories I F and

94
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,740
on the portion that time presenting you
about we only have for

95
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,310
known samples the you have that has his
ear if you have access to fire so so it

96
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,040
can download

97
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,229
hair this is more or less

98
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,979
the the design of the smaller its

99
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:05,250
the lever to targets P an exploit
usually they also use social engineering

100
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,150
hair tough through it that's quite done
at the dropper is all that

101
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,640
which contained other models which are
basically an object or

102
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,580
rootkits the other models which is to
get

103
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,940
control of patients and configuration
some features of the smaller

104
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,960
its 10 control the microphone the webcam

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,900
I have some doubts about this idea to
try to make it two active

106
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,250
because you have the hardware lead on
get worse

107
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,970
there was some research three years ago
or last year about so the

108
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:42,200
by pressing that camera in Mike's but
its was only valid for all quite so I

109
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,370
have some doubts about

110
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,660
these future it could take screenshots
where you were

111
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,120
and get to the malls are located on it
says that she ordered

112
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,190
the contract from Allstate take
screenshots I have from the malls

113
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,400
it scare the car to Skype conversations

114
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,539
the Microsoft Messenger is a Hemi Sync
which is one of the most

115
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,660
is a plan Stan and Mike and can spy on
roller skates hopes the

116
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,920
what's the brother is doing and some
other capabilities like

117
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,990
tracking all your location

118
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,510
and so on so let's get into the proper

119
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,760
let all the properties delivered to you
exports

120
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,569
flies toward it sits right there was
some connection with open and

121
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,009
one classics quite open says no we
didn't sell to them

122
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,379
there can be a conflict of its quite so
that story was never

123
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:33,139
and truly

124
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,159
and develop social engineering reno some
samples were delivered by

125
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:41,370
pleases told me this is some stuff you
are interested a rare

126
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,030
usually the targets are journalists
because they want to

127
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,909
to get nails and install the stuff
suffers it's very small it's less than

128
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,410
one megabyte usually

129
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,080
and you have a sample that I'm going to
refer switch

130
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,250
the reason why because the last sample
files

131
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,330
and I don't remember to date I think it
was this year

132
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,479
beginning of this year in January we
found it so or

133
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,670
some coming from the time they sent it
to me because it's fun for

134
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,710
we initially sought these was the latest
version

135
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,890
so we've got some polls & 2012

136
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,510
2013 and so we funding the

137
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,230
theory was this is the latest sample air
later I will try to show you why I don't

138
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,450
think this is true and I think this is
the first sample

139
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,360
a

140
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,490
that actor training dropped in the wilds
this is the contents of the files

141
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,289
the is to have the main but for model
you ever kernel extensions list which

142
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:38,740
are

143
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,979
repeats for 64-bit systems and
certificates

144
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,290
you have a wonderful which eases three
objects into obligations what they used

145
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,160
to inject

146
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,640
you have an expert in 10 diseased by
press Send books and other stuff

147
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,990
then you have a configuration file and
you have a name which the

148
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,470
in which basically it's and

149
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,540
is it true social engineer the user to

150
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,400
give me more privileges also known as
the great world access

151
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,000
so I can install the the rootkit they
have no exploits

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,779
side these and these files they have no
exploits

153
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,250
so basically they get more access by
asking the user

154
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,040
give me access although the dropper
starts

155
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,089
it triste y the

156
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:25,600
and the entry points usually when you
start a binary there's an entry point

157
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,100
they tried to hide these so you if you
load using the

158
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,259
December a you get the function that
this

159
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:35,829
that there's nothing its is a these

160
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,229
easily detected if you look at the the
head nurse

161
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,559
of the virus I recommend you to always

162
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,329
either this is the first thing you get
that unknown binary you know we tease

163
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:51,279
black binary your local and into the
tools you ever hope to lower Michael

164
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:51,860
fewer

165
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,410
annual descended start poking around the
heathers

166
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,449
tried to understand what the binary is
doing

167
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:03,420
Tim spot mining attract many tricks and
just play it with this step

168
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,399
this is a screenshot 0 the what I call
think start

169
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,139
what the scale watch I i understand says
the

170
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:16,440
the entry point is the fake one the you
can see the

171
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,620
be the in my criticism over some binary

172
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,589
so it has a history of mining they it as
a function called start that

173
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,060
then the sum so I think and just hells

174
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,599
the the main but to seeing the ANC
usually

175
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,509
they recall that function and its exit
this

176
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,569
what this function does nothing it
basically most israelis

177
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:42,040
control local variables and the five and
the aids

178
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,730
return 0 and that's it if you are now on
our stories

179
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,959
you are the first time that you are
reversing make stuff

180
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,160
your movies into I them to seek business
not doing

181
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,810
NSA what is the real story and about
this

182
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,680
these the spring shots of for
qualifications Michael feel that you

183
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,649
know you can use to

184
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,069
to look at the heathers you can see the
healthy

185
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,680
you next thread command which is the
common the

186
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,969
Patrick the talked about yesterday the
comment that says than three points

187
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,320
and easier the problem starts his
address

188
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,220
you can see their breasts or I hope so
which starts at the

189
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,310
50 960 and if you see the dress

190
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,489
here its 1s eighty so

191
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,240
there's a difference between what I this
the seas and what's

192
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,390
happens in reality where is the address

193
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,189
be the first season and other statements
he was something in my crew have

194
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,570
different segments in a binary

195
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,320
an asshole you can pinpoint the entry
point as long the

196
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,200
sec segment is executable your points
and you can say

197
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,850
and start executing here starting to
getting there no problem

198
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,110
so basically the buyer the binary their
30s the

199
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,870
different segment aid stuff this is not
a commoner and

200
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,980
and segment miners this is a custom
segments and they have for

201
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,680
the segment on the binary and you can
see the PM address it starts at the

202
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,050
I so long and it has a big sites and the
size basically contains

203
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,469
the the whole mall where

204
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,790
on the whole man payloads and then
starts executing

205
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,000
their some

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,100
tips n treats if you want to put this
stuff are a few years she be

207
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,720
in my quest it doesn't like to and to
set breakpoints

208
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,050
outside the text segment which is the
normal segment on normal whiners

209
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,900
13 he just edit the binary you put sign
in for a pre

210
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:46,319
on the first flights and then you can
emulate their structural

211
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,010
is one candidate so I would cut its
movie the PSP

212
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,220
which is setting the on the initial
function stock and all that stuff

213
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,780
and its very easy to relate to you that
the breakpoint on GTV and you move

214
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,230
the the register and that's it the not
jackson's

215
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,370
exists so you are free to press the fine
art

216
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,680
so what's these the dropper doing it
doesn't have any imports

217
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,160
so if you look at the list of imports I

218
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,410
you doing Windows it is seen that same
you wanna see the eggs etc also

219
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,780
another trait to say whole these binary

220
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,140
does not say it is dangerous 18 which is
a common way to

221
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,330
for as his calls and UNIX

222
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,880
you can do the same mark it does these
functions a

223
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,630
it opened its starting lineup this is
basically use to my

224
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,150
libraries and and

225
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,439
and the hand to some stuff it is a a
normal Windows

226
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,630
creek that is seen we have smaller which
is dynamically solving the same both

227
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:53,630
class and really in you Pro two

228
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,020
is the different way to go to the saint
so I'm always

229
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm trying to teach them how to do some
stuff and you can't

230
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,110
also this there's no need to learn to
read the library's directly from the

231
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,790
filesystem

232
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,459
because the Mac you are the liar is
already mapping memory because of the

233
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,030
the cash feature also BYOB which is the
linker

234
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,449
the most important ally worries that
contain the stuff that's

235
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,730
you are interested at least bootstrap
lower they are already in memory

236
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,080
so we can you can read them from

237
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,270
from memory and do whatever he wants
just the description of these

238
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,680
this piece of gold proves my point what
it does

239
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,729
it is a very simple binary that the

240
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,310
price police the whole the binary
although I was that are linked

241
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,810
in the payment a 80 itself so we can see
different libraries

242
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,020
and for example I chose that we've
system kernel

243
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,880
at that address another

244
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,980
binary the same as hello world had to
prove my point

245
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,050
the I compile it Sunday executes a side
the butter because I'm not

246
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,109
using the same function school the show
itself and you can see the same library

247
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,990
their map their at the same address the
summer dresses because the

248
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,410
ASLR where course is implemented on
boats every time he boards

249
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,180
the SLR offsets the the slide changes

250
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,680
eso when is to let the computer boots
the

251
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,300
this light is the same so the library's
are located at the same address for all

252
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,160
programs

253
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,219
all this crisis finds the

254
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,540
functions thats that its and X Snow
Leopard

255
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,469
there was no fool is still are it was
only implemented and now I am

256
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,690
the Snow Leopard only had on hand

257
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,000
by terrorism in my heart and honor and
their

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,820
residents the the linker at the fixed
address these was a former Realty

259
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,350
attend could be used for example for
exports because you you gots

260
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,430
unknown address at the fixes the drugs
and you can use that for

261
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,979
for exports physically the pic over they
know

262
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,400
that there is an address of the going
very good at talking about why and I

263
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,120
miss him lie and the song there's a

264
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,250
one address of the linker in the spec
and they've been recovered the address

265
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,040
so the exploit these stack layouts when
when the program starts

266
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,550
and they reference that

267
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,800
some bites away on the stack and they
get an address and then after that you

268
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,579
can just go back and find

269
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,540
the beginning of the binary and then
processed the samples a and so on

270
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,439
this is the way like where's the exec
its binary the

271
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,649
although the flow from from the kernel
and then to control

272
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,430
passes to the link there and and a
linker processes libraries and all that

273
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:40,899
stuff

274
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,509
and its control finally to the entry
point of the

275
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:49,819
of the primary disease

276
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,959
all they are doing all they are finding
that I'm

277
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,630
the linker thrust the

278
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:01,180
under the under number one your they are
finding it so that dress of themselves

279
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,099
because they need these for for some
stuff the years or a trip years or

280
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,879
they are probably using the builtin
return address future of

281
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,069
shitty and clinton also as it gives you
the

282
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,159
the return of Christ of the function and
then they know the distance to the

283
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,299
to the base of the program and then they
get there the business risks abroad

284
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:23,379
and then they are resting on

285
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,799
true the back it pp the my nose 5c

286
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,120
and the the sixties and prayers this is
all your own for light and

287
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,059
in the Snow Leopard view does not exist
and the reference the fix it lol

288
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:40,160
and the mental I am a matrix these bogus

289
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,400
doesn't doesn't work this is one of the
reasons ways to try to run the sample

290
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,110
in a min once and I and our favorites
it'll crash

291
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:55,110
I'm this is a very complicated picture
and what time to make you a starkly l2

292
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,158
can look at these

293
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,510
slater is just the show we wipe the
steak

294
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,330
changed and why the samples crashing
Munsell I am and

295
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,460
my favorites another preemptive

296
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,289
there there's an easier way and at least
stable like this thing all versions

297
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,850
and it seems to work if you were get
that maybe they'll be wearing

298
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,668
me instead of using this offset the
years 5c it's just he is minus

299
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:24,610
0c you get is the address inside the
linker

300
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,678
and you get what's what's watching you
its

301
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,059
it to for references different addresses
and indifference Michael Mike Mike with

302
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:32,710
merchant

303
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,110
but it gets through the dress inside the
linker so that's what you wanted on

304
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,629
you don't really mind the part where
tracy's as long as

305
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,690
is inside the linker you are okay the
only caveat about these thats

306
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,470
it must be compiled and gas the

307
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,580
s the keel as SDK of Snow Leopard

308
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,710
if you compile with that it was portions
the it will it will not work

309
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,130
this is not the wrong because you are
making our soap he worked for

310
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,440
one under whatever conditions work this
sample codes

311
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,200
a everything from its district gets the
PvP from

312
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,990
from the program and then price to
referenced

313
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,120
the the hand that dress on the stack

314
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,340
if you try it is it will work it will
give you always

315
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,780
the

316
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:26,660
and address site the wildy even with a
four-way SLR without a SLR

317
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,010
it works so weeks I'm it's a nice spring
I'm not sure

318
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,770
offer along it will work is to prove my
point

319
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,590
the running on all I am I'm directing
the

320
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,929
dressed the you can see the HGTV's
telling you it's a cycle interview SR

321
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,010
review while the

322
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,450
so it works in my favorites for is the
same

323
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,830
against you couldn't spot the the
functioning

324
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,960
it here it's the well the bootstrapper

325
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,990
a long name because it's it was close
and the Mavericks it gives you a beer

326
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,180
while the start

327
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,320
difference a difference the minority
areas but still inside the link or so

328
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,399
it works after all these

329
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,390
the basically prices maximal iris it
finds the

330
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,970
the levers thats its impressive in and
start searching the singles that's

331
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,350
that's he wants to

332
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,730
use it is is these us function as the
p.m.

333
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,370
to obfuscate so they don't have the
symbol and say it's not direct

334
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,040
the is very easy true brute force it
just

335
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,149
get these Asheville creates a small
script and you go through the samples of

336
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,260
all libraries

337
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,540
and generate bastion then you can
compare and know what's what the what

338
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,280
matches

339
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,680
what they are looking for so the
function tools to solve the singles that

340
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,020
allocates the singles it's interesting

341
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,470
it gets the failure or there are two
functions two separate functions for

342
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,930
Snow Leopard and Lion

343
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,420
have no idea why they are doing this I
just know that the latter portion has a

344
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,740
knack for the ball

345
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,290
the I cannot see why they are doing they
are going this way

346
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,170
and because a single version can be
compatible with all these

347
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,070
set the screenshots from this is not
there

348
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,710
call this is Michael it shows you all to
to implement the street

349
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,400
you'll get the Heather me the link that
its segments Anne that information then

350
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,280
you may have the same type commands

351
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,710
begets the symbol where the singles are
located

352
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,170
and then here's the scope who get the
singles find the singles

353
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,880
you want and US some piece of our own 3

354
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,050
of bogus call which basically matches
one that has short strangle whatever you

355
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,520
want

356
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,629
and

357
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,940
we've what you are looking for and
retrieves the valley where the single

358
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:48,940
them is located then use some functions
there are some

359
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,840
you I'll be fun trips they need to the

360
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,409
if you won't get the singles from the
library's the only get the

361
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,870
addressed earlier but you don't know
where the wiry easy mainly

362
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,939
say need to find that offset because I
was 10 be

363
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,010
and putting difference different
addresses tended to find the raises

364
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,400
rates

365
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,080
there are some the while the functions

366
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,320
and that assist you these are two
functions very much count

367
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,418
tells you what many mice they are on the
on the binary

368
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,500
then you get the budget there which is
the location of the library

369
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,559
and to get the eulogy name so we just
made it all gets there

370
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,250
the county traits a from all the images

371
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,409
and get the name makes the name twats
were looking for

372
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:34,899
and if it matches you get through
processing to get the sale that's

373
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:38,889
the 21 this is what they are doing here
and they are

374
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,419
its rating for the the images they try
to find the library

375
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,769
they are looking for in this case it's
the lead system kernel

376
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:49,059
which contains most of the time
important functions

377
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:53,678
in this case they are looking for the
open function and they find the same

378
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,740
goal

379
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,940
Honda on the library and then they at
the base the price of the library

380
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,730
because they already located it's and
after tease you have the function

381
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,600
pointer

382
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,730
to to use after

383
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,990
resolving all the singles the take care
thus

384
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,730
stuff with the filesystem land other
stuff they do

385
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,420
drop the bailouts and this is the first
part but I talk things he's

386
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,040
NBC year and they rights always the same
colour

387
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,450
which is the currents username pale
ivory preferences and then around them

388
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,510
this can be easily detected the I
created the

389
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,629
a role model to to the techniques and

390
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,740
you can go to same boxes can do not post
my name

391
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,990
my slides but you have a slight on my
blog and the Canon

392
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,790
check this and you ever gonna get up to
the court for these so this is very easy

393
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,850
tool to detect I was making fun of them
because

394
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,050
before selling them hour for 200 K

395
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,460
you can do better than and its the
sample there is going on on that folder

396
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,640
but for her name an already strong

397
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,940
deuce so at the right to know the pilots

398
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,550
a US your system set up in the
filesystem they just

399
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:14,139
for enlarge the break nor model which is
the the core of the system

400
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,910
and then they head returned the control
to the fake address these is always to

401
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,400
execute eons he and a single because
they

402
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,740
call like that that function to think
that dress and the pic start

403
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,600
and isn't he NSA at this is the supple
called

404
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,530
and you can see the a sec I have I don't
have the four

405
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,100
here but they for before and they exact
and that

406
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,159
that namely the that binary a toll th

407
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,080
it's coming back to your mobile and then
they return control to the

408
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,178
to the to the faith address

409
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,059
so let's continue with the break normal

410
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,110
that although this is the core

411
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,669
up crisis is responsible for

412
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:04,540
injected injection into the Tigers
applications a rejection is all they spy

413
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,570
on coming on skype for example

414
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,730
they put cold on on skype project scope
there and then they can hope functions

415
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,950
and retrieve the

416
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,669
the calls to the binary that
communicates with the

417
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:19,550
sorry the comment on patrol so this is
the one that won three fours

418
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,190
for looking what's happening it does all
the logging

419
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,190
files at Chrissy's via shared memory
from all the other components

420
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,960
receives the data and then rights two
walks it controls the rootkits

421
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,550
and the Sun tons of other other stuff

422
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,059
it is called in object to see if you
know Mike you know that object to see

423
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:40,410
you

424
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,140
very burrows they didn't even all escape
the method names

425
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,390
so we wear names like here injects and

426
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:53,030
name-checked the to release prob
discrete skiing creates Kia and so on

427
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,830
and so this is very easy to reverse

428
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,389
after he gets and the pic tomorrow it's
a 32 bits on binary

429
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,679
there because they they want to
compatibility with all the versions

430
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,040
and his version and they simply in
particular is fax

431
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,178
which is very where events on

432
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,010
when my course is one of the reasons why
I decided

433
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,669
show you this simple and

434
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:21,890
its embraced

435
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,630
let me just quickly go through impress
this the Packer

436
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,020
is very easy proton pack it's not a real
obstacle to

437
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,559
to reversing I really think that generic
number so if you don't want to

438
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:38,960
who gets into it just have a very simple
utility view the source to give the

439
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,410
the targets click them and you get there

440
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,960
the unpacked file it's only one of the
two Generac

441
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,360
and lasts a man available to the public
akers the other one is

442
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,300
px I know a few other ones the but they
are custom and they are from work

443
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,610
that tied it so I cannot talk about hang
their

444
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,030
these from to impress cites the

445
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,960
they they give you over a interesting
people they say that's the

446
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,179
programs compressed really impressed if
no one time

447
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:14,730
penalties prime-time performance
bounties this basically tells you that

448
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,280
the impact the binary and there are
regional binary runs

449
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,149
if they were doing for example the Layer
encryption encryption and compression

450
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,300
and decompression

451
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,168
there will be a run-time performance so
this tells you they just turn back

452
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:33,429
after its impact you can retrieve
everything and also saying that the

453
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:37,450
it also protects programs against
reverse engineering my non-professional

454
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,090
hackers had a good thing head they tell
us

455
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,590
because we have a problem because we are
professionals

456
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,360
quick overview because I don't have time
for

457
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,959
much more and you want to go to lunch
did the

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,080
what you get when they start the the
program that is

459
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,689
act you ever look into memory the the
segment where the original battery

460
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,460
binary is going to be then you ever

461
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,470
Heather of impressed there which is

462
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,480
the the program and US a clever

463
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,409
which is what they are going to
uncompress and the way financial stuff

464
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:18,580
on initial start with where the
execution the

465
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,780
starts put this to bed does

466
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,158
is called ok its primary and their

467
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,490
and the the binary true the for the
regional location

468
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,810
also and back the secondary stock which
he isn't

469
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,320
in place of the Heather the Heather was
here

470
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,320
and they've replaced with the secondary
stuff

471
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,810
asserts there these to start executing
on the second stuff but the second step

472
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,960
basically the

473
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,460
faced when late the linker sets all the
stake and the

474
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,320
some other stuff gets control to linger
linger

475
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,189
does all its normal job of linking
libraries solving same rules and so on

476
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:06,520
and after that controls quest to
original fiery

477
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,720
right now you have a normal binary
memory it did and at this point to 10

478
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,929
them the binary and if you dump it to
the correct way

479
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:22,429
you have a the original buyer results
any problem at all

480
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,750
I would love to go into details but I
don't have time

481
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,240
sure once

482
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,770
the slides are very verbose and if you
want to get into details

483
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,330
come outside and and I can explain you
some details about these and a

484
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,169
how it is implemented the whole
implementation people from work Stuka

485
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,810
this important

486
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,990
hail to the book and press some tips and
tricks

487
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,320
it does the same problem the because
it's outside of the

488
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,810
of the text segment there you can use
the same trick you put on and three

489
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:00,780
the interrupts effects the binary and
its you can

490
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,970
you can I

491
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,500
finally the puppies because it through
our slides and getting the binary and

492
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,080
their

493
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,090
other debugger it will see the thing for
a previous of breakpoint

494
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,918
and the the brother always gets the
notification

495
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,289
and this

496
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:22,629
are prepared are all trying to compress
basically our tickets the details all I

497
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,960
implemented the

498
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,769
hamper and what's also very close and
I'm going to release the source code and

499
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,010
you can see the

500
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,010
the details about eat this stuff

501
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,450
this also expressing their not all

502
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,870
hair not all samples can be done there's
another sample

503
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,129
that dates back to meet them first
they're the reason why you cannot just

504
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,340
them for their equity it's because
they're the possibility of differences

505
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:48,949
between

506
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,159
what have their say is that it's a
memory

507
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,929
and what should be on file this is a
dumb

508
00:30:56,929 --> 00:31:00,019
for screenshot: of the sample the

509
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:03,720
if you can see you have the VM size
which is the size in memory

510
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,549
these days it's for solvent and the file
size which is the file

511
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:11,820
on the size of the of these and

512
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,570
memory segments on reduced you can see
here its results so what's difference

513
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,830
the the memory layout of the sample

514
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:26,059
a ok this is what I want to show you the
Heather say

515
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,240
say that you should they have that that
the

516
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,059
memory layout a few see you ever on

517
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,680
55,000 and

518
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,740
that statement and the object is to
segment starting gates 58 sells out

519
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,840
but what's it with them these

520
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,168
and directly hearing on the screen are
going to have for

521
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:51,179
that the segment it will be a inside

522
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:55,249
the objective-c segment this is because
%uh the foresees one southern whites

523
00:31:55,249 --> 00:32:00,509
which was difference here the difference
between 3pm size and the file size:

524
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:06,710
so what you need to do anything parse
the heathers before dumping

525
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,369
you read the Heather of the of the
target minor that you want to them

526
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:14,399
and to check if there's the front seats
there is the first

527
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,529
you fix the damn you want the file

528
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,950
size of these because it usually when
the memory I

529
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,149
bigger that that these undies it's not
be heard and the that on memory

530
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:29,629
so you know that that on this case
brought what you want everything else

531
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:33,149
can be alignment or what was that that
that's and doesn't

532
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:39,070
made is is not needed on on base some

533
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,689
stuff about the make or model the

534
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,049
when it starts it is sister sorta tips

535
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:49,859
when it starts with the it says hooks
the

536
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:52,918
logging function these vacant don't roll
knots

537
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,940
put information on the system wats what
you want to reverse itself to reverse

538
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,239
this

539
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:02,080
going to start from that premise that
its where everything happens where does

540
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,399
all the israelis Asian

541
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,379
and where it starts through to connect
to the command-and-control server

542
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:10,908
and and everything everything else so

543
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:14,539
be the method that you want and to start
reversing

544
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:19,389
ass some the the shared memory that

545
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:23,498
it just told you can also use these for
example for detection because it happens

546
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:28,259
and in all the samples it doesn't happen
on these names are not to use it by

547
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:32,059
the normal Mike system and there's a
fire ants which is largely

548
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:35,279
which can easily didn't distinguish
between what is the

549
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,460
normal and what's not so very easy to

550
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,259
to detect their is also important

551
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:46,570
it all today but the sample there is a
90 but measure

552
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,739
the which basically the Trevor that from
time to time

553
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,809
checks see for the buzzer is attached to
the binary

554
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:56,849
basically call tracks from from when
those

555
00:33:56,849 --> 00:34:01,080
shown to bypass these you just nope the
call that installs

556
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,070
the the threat that these bring these
shaped the view the place where

557
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,879
your once basically wonder if you are

558
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:13,219
using the debugger your just skip that
caller

559
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,239
just veteran and not that call and

560
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,308
their goals the anti-fracking number one

561
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:23,099
disease shows you the square what is
doing the

562
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:26,540
you can see the sleep there and then you
have the city's comptroller

563
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,500
take the trick that is described on

564
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,879
thats technical note if you want more
details about this is good for you hope

565
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:34,868
three axle

566
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,649
nothing special the handy but

567
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:41,940
freak truly is if you want to do but the

568
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,520
the bank for mobile because if you are
exiting from the proper it's a bit

569
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,839
annoying because in a true

570
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,308
wait for them packing and so on what one
wants thing you can do

571
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:54,369
it just extract the binary and then you
can debug its just think the patsies

572
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:58,940
which is basically some check for the
configuration file kemp et cheese and

573
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,630
overtime the number three is under
itself uninstall

574
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,230
I will try to show you why this happens
the

575
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:10,770
later here if you want through just
pitch the score these jump

576
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:16,069
paid you are okay you can continue to
keep our I call these lame persistent

577
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:18,640
threats you ever the par-3 could call

578
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,710
I talk yesterday he talked about how to
persist basically what they do or where

579
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,800
they create a launch a gente something
very simple very easy to detect massing

580
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,290
nothing complicated the they could have
done it is much better

581
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,400
the 3 presented some some

582
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,570
ideas that that I created presented
other ways

583
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,180
and so this this couldn't be much better

584
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,879
band then what what it is encryption
keys

585
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,380
Herman the drop the

586
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,460
Victor Manuel contains at least three
encryption keys

587
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,400
up that tool

588
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,650
are hard-coded for the log files so all
the log files are infected on disk

589
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,890
the configuration file is also important

590
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,480
and there's a specialty that these
dynamically generated

591
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,680
with this server this means that say

592
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,828
if you ever the traffic Tampa traffic
them for network them

593
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:21,940
you need also the binary tool to try to
reverse

594
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,670
the the session key so we can to create
what is happening

595
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:32,190
but i think is over HTTP bro it just
total not trigger any warnings from

596
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,160
ideas and I all that stuff

597
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,700
the the location of the case the last
thing the session key

598
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,069
is not general it's not there it's zero
because it's

599
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:46,170
generator there's another key which is
is it true established the

600
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,210
the session so they ever not guilty they
call the server they generate the key

601
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:58,210
and then they established the session
key some other details the low-income

602
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:02,210
free population files I encrypt it we
have the as:

603
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,760
one this 28's the CBC with no I V

604
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,650
so it's basically very easy to the
crepes using good open SSL you

605
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,119
get the key from the binary antique and
the crypt files

606
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,980
if if I V is on the sample you get this
problem

607
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,780
the corruption doesn't work hey that's
bogus bytes

608
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,220
and get the win. SSL complaining that it
cannot

609
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,779
the crypt why because they introduce it

610
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,069
a no whites at the beginning of the
configuration file

611
00:37:31,069 --> 00:37:34,619
there's no reason for invites they are
not to use it for anything

612
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,940
they are basically there for tripping
open SSL

613
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:44,589
and you cannot the crips it directly you
can safely remove one trick is basically

614
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:45,200
you're

615
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,250
grab the binary the operation file
remove those whites and run open SSL

616
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:55,329
again wanna so still complains I don't
know why I didn't bother to reverse open

617
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:55,890
SSL

618
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:00,480
but the the crips the the binder the
configuration file without any problems

619
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,520
or you can correct this motility using
the Apple function cccc

620
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,660
creates and/or implement yourself the

621
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:13,390
the description nothing very complicated
shows you the corporation father crafted

622
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,750
and open SSL complaining that still
cannot

623
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,000
the grapes but it the crips other way

624
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,670
so tray celebrations as I told the O The
methods are very verbal so they have to

625
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,869
make something cryptids

626
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:32,170
with key the creepy key people to break
points on these functions and you can

627
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,280
get the contents of what is being
recruited though and the critic

628
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,460
began his for example the tracey is very
powerful for these

629
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,170
gildy traces matter then you can't put
it down to the perimeters

630
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,240
and you don't even need the debugger the
temp for example

631
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,140
lockneys to a file him get over the
earning per to information or you can

632
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,328
just break point on it

633
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,660
on that function the zip recall seeing
you

634
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,828
use on when his mom where are you
breakpoint and a function artists to

635
00:38:58,829 --> 00:38:59,369
function

636
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:05,010
that the Great Sand Hill that the
contents see the full file for the group

637
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:05,710
to file

638
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,010
the do the former the binary format in
the sample the use a binary for what

639
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,720
and other sample they have a chaser
Jason formats

640
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,439
this seems to be the use format this is
one of the peeps why I think the

641
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,760
other sample several ways over because
if you look at the

642
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,980
article from Citizen lab fail so ever
these

643
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,620
this configuration file the same
structure the same Jason

644
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,910
trying to start reversing break point on
that Massa

645
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,440
and you can easily understand what is
going when loading the

646
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,140
the configuration file this is the

647
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,009
attempts of the

648
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,319
structure of the classes names and all
that stuff I i don't have time to

649
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:52,460
explain this to you

650
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:56,280
the I can tell you that the
configuration file is divided into

651
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,010
different sections events agents

652
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:01,730
or open bypass the agencies wats

653
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,270
the section that's gives you the mall
deals that the practice

654
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:11,700
a from what we gots from their internet
on the condition they sell the first

655
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,029
model so US to buy a license if you want
to use Skype round webcam and all that

656
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,470
stuff

657
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,348
and is the the that these activated here

658
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:23,819
yeah these the over the first thing

659
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:28,890
of the configuration file of the binary
I don't think I i me that's cool

660
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,549
forties I will probably do it all and
just publish it

661
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,869
and you can extract information from the
configuration file

662
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:39,040
one interesting thing about the sample

663
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,259
is that it's only has one agent active
although the samples ever different

664
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,829
engines

665
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:46,970
active for example webcam were

666
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,549
the logging off Skype all that stuff
they have active

667
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,340
this one only has one agents active and
his agent just collect information

668
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,410
about the computer desire for me that is
another

669
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,490
keep or are there were just doing trying
to shake

670
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,720
that targets understands what the target
was

671
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,480
or this is basically at the core sample
that there really is for researchers to

672
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,670
call them and say okay have fun with
these the ball

673
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,610
have fun with it there so why

674
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,370
the simple and installed itself it's
because the

675
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,960
the sample as a expiration dates its

676
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,480
it hands on April 30 2012 these

677
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,980
another tape why the sample he's very
holds

678
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,500
and if you wave your computers seized
all these

679
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,370
on your computer with the current plates
the central real and install itself

680
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:46,339
so the trick is medically or install
with the they to be four days

681
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,040
or just bets that function and you can
continue to reverse

682
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:57,040
mmm this is basically the description of
their track

683
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,940
the prices some things the a

684
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,110
trade that is monitoring for England's
the

685
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:08,310
basically I i say it's an internal con
crontab there's many events if we see

686
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,730
the events from the mall deals

687
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,290
and verifies if it has operations it has
operations

688
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,540
a process that stuff this is more

689
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,290
implementation details you get here to
take and you can see

690
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,710
city but these you can clearly see the
dates and

691
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,610
their expiration dates a

692
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,610
are often our

693
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,880
prize implements the functions which is
basically

694
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,910
always gets permission from the targets
they use a bundle

695
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,609
they inject a bundle 80 the our kids the
hook

696
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:45,190
the interesting fun trucks and they
basically ok the data

697
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,880
get the data and then call the original
functions that stinks

698
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,360
nothing special they said that that that
that may impact or

699
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,380
and the the door the they loads and sent
to the

700
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,290
coming out of control and

701
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,990
quick quick quick quick can let me go to
control these

702
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,220
the model injection the there there are

703
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,890
different ways to do it these from YM
and its not all the russians Snow

704
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:11,670
Leopard and

705
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,450
a leopard this hearing that is is lying

706
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,419
the reason for days it's because the
security in Lyon

707
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,710
improved so they need to do these in a
different way

708
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,560
what they use is basically a
notification mechanism wenner

709
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,090
when you launch an application a
graphical application you can get a

710
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,140
notification from waco s

711
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,390
to anyone can we stand on this and you
can get

712
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:39,049
the application Skype started and the
computer they really think they put the

713
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,770
one of one observer

714
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:46,870
the the are the observers they are all
those servers that they install

715
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,339
the true they want they are interested
in

716
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,790
when the application is started and
wonderfully Keisha

717
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:58,750
terminates basically you say I want to
know every position that starts

718
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,450
tell me about it and when you get that
notification

719
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,910
the you can call selector which is
basically a

720
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,940
methods in this case when the
application starts

721
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,970
they get an injection they want to
inject into the application

722
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,799
and when the petition hands they want to
to clear the stuff and stopped walking

723
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,100
and all that stuff

724
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,470
for example they also stole another
press corps application

725
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:25,109
I didn't fully reverse this I believe
it's basically when you have a a new

726
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:25,810
number or

727
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:29,779
take a number from the address book you
get a notification

728
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,130
and they are monitoring the that stuff
their interest there

729
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:37,810
your connection issues that future and

730
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:43,000
these are details about some on the
panel injection

731
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,960
you escapees the basically these

732
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,370
the cold for these to rutile

733
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,660
my theory is that they got this cold be
there for me the symbol

734
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,250
or or single and they just copy this
code and a

735
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,740
answer to the name and in their car
because these is the

736
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,620
very known for implementations their
first they're all that works so

737
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,120
they didn't develop these they got this
code

738
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,330
this is some problem I don't have time
to explain you

739
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:17,000
these pretty you days anger

740
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,710
but the slides are very close if you
have any thoughts just ask me

741
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,690
for I

742
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,720
disease coking coal for messenger

743
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,730
the what the new in Objective C you have
a technique a few no

744
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,800
show ringtone lax stuff this is a very
known technique

745
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,620
is the future of the language of
objective-c by the way you can

746
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:45,620
exchange pointers entail these matters
now his room replaced by this matter

747
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,220
and the original myself can still feel
be called

748
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,509
these okay and

749
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:56,560
interior its the language supports T is
natively so these

750
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,460
very a very nice for doing some

751
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,160
usually people use this for implementing
new features

752
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:11,160
these days to get the the information
the communications for

753
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,100
with the common control server they are
encrypt it over a shit EP the use the

754
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,470
rest for the gold

755
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,980
the if you want to see the initial
communication

756
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,910
break point on deck master and we can
reverse the session key

757
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,549
being staunchly the server and all that
the initial communications

758
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:33,150
and I if you want more details about
these

759
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,260
a check there's the science paper
released

760
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,610
few weeks ago they have it within hours
is on the network

761
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:42,670
on the details on the comments on the
establishment

762
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,710
of the session so it's very interesting
I just wonder

763
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,100
but the rootkit I

764
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,710
I like food pizza lots and their work it
is very simple

765
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,710
the isotope you to

766
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,170
versions a 32 bit and 64 it's a very
small

767
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:06,990
a 10 10 10k white sand 14k bite so this
is not safe it's very clear

768
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,299
very few features it to say essentially
a tights files and processes

769
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,400
its I think they're back for mobile

770
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,120
and their files where they install the
file the

771
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,420
is a screenshot of all the fun trips so
it you can say it doesn't have many

772
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,070
features

773
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,490
it is is that the vice another point

774
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,040
of the texan and for communications if
you have these

775
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,020
and the price on your Mac it means that
you are infected

776
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,210
and we've that we've crisis all versions
is this

777
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,730
these device the I don't know why they
don't randomized is tough

778
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,420
at least they could from the my runways
this stuff its

779
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,520
it shows you the they are really lazy
implementing

780
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,560
this this stuff they also I the ferry

781
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,370
hey I call it famous because I joke with
it the

782
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,779
to reverse the route 80 you can find
some I O

783
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,990
could I'll still commands is also a

784
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,649
coming messaging and Linux to
communicates with the

785
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,110
with watkins are with the kernel
extension on we are normal

786
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,310
if you send the commander tire but

787
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,200
II octo commended the work it is running
he said this command

788
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,299
and the rude people it's basically shows
itself stop citing files is

789
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,920
huge but really funny but he said the
commander with kids

790
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,900
stops working and shows everything and
once again it shows a Weezy

791
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:35,330
a they are the best feature of these
rootkits and I it was

792
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,779
no vote for me the they they have a new
message

793
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,230
to hide the rootkits and a new versions
of Mac OS

794
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:45,910
the Apple implemented the

795
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:51,049
anyway they have another object which is
II rocket object where they put the

796
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:51,510
least

797
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,589
of of for

798
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:57,529
kernel extensions that are loaded if you
look at old papers

799
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:00,730
and there was an easy way there was a a
link to please

800
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,930
we've the the kernel extensions in with
at least keep that least and you could

801
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:05,368
hi

802
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:09,490
with me for something is also to work on
the site ok it objects

803
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:14,000
and since it's it was close it's not
sold direct to find the location of the

804
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,839
object and they

805
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,119
they implemented the it was the first
time the

806
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,599
I tip my hats off to them until they're
very well I like his

807
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:27,500
I'm at least I i large finally something
with you II never bother trying to find

808
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,920
a way and they got in the way

809
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,589
these was a at least something there

810
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:37,359
near what they did it right more details
about this check but post-its on my blog

811
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,440
I resource

812
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,599
that implements that implementation and
out they

813
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,770
to its some details the all the samples

814
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:48,869
do not use the route kids there is a

815
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:54,570
proportions the AH 56k and the 57 K

816
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,060
the all the samples are 56k

817
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,140
iPad's the one of the samples

818
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,720
to be a 57 and what happens is that
prizes asks you for

819
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,140
admin privileges to install the rootkit
all samples are 56

820
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,650
so they don't use that would keep they
believe her it's under the proper

821
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,740
but they never it's probably because
asking for

822
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,359
user for permissions it will trigger my
trigger

823
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:24,060
warning with some users could most
easily it's probably

824
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,080
will probably work as we know it

825
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:32,210
is really like to exit routes and the
same publishes

826
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:35,599
hair conspiracy theories everywhere

827
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,830
if relief ice taxa and I say it a lot
that's

828
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,819
crisis is bear an hour and
implementation is bad are technically

829
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,330
is not nothing special it's very future
completes

830
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,390
the II bet they they got many

831
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,509
I

832
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:56,599
targets the spy the party using this
because the

833
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:00,170
not everyone is a specialist and Mike
schools

834
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,210
a you know most users it just a two
seater

835
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:08,740
at an airport NEC all pens a stupid
sinks people plugging their cell phones

836
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,098
on

837
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,700
USB port so what's charger station let
me put my

838
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,529
I O S phone or my android phone all
kinds of stuff

839
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:19,599
there so this is growing very affected

840
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,569
there's very few car technology
developed the

841
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:26,930
can also buy these i mean they did it
other than their

842
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,430
or Patrick they didn't develop much
stuff they basically

843
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:34,180
got stuff from I went to the

844
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,020
Waveland see the zollo injects

845
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,720
we get diseases I'll we soul singles if
you get this

846
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,959
basically they put together packets and

847
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,410
from others people Colt

848
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:51,509
so well let me just tell you why ice

849
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:55,690
think this simple ways older the sample
was Sault Ste 202 being you are as a

850
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:56,220
tribute

851
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,250
and there was a connection to Pope
Francis

852
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,100
and

853
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:07,100
using the clock up

854
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,670
justice the because there was a
connection through with the pope

855
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,040
where the pope were got time power

856
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,050
its own and it's all the the immediate
connection with the pope so the sample

857
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:22,870
is very ill

858
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:26,970
there was a binary configuration file
head

859
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:31,009
the sinking was okay there's a binary
they came out from Jason

860
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,920
had a son is very clear binary peeps few
more trouble

861
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,250
so this is probably a better version
open this is so pretty care

862
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:43,060
it doesn't exist on the samples using
Jason so we actually

863
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:47,500
go with more advanced they are trying to
to hide because I was very hurtful see

864
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:47,960
the

865
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,500
the first time for ID for blog posts
reversing the stuff

866
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,700
I think they don't like that and so the
thinking was

867
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,000
they are improving the stuff and there
were some code changes in to drop or

868
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,320
there we sought to they were better for
for better

869
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,340
sold either a mess up reeve

870
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:09,020
by analysis police the

871
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,620
or whether I fund is when I was
finishing reversing for this

872
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,330
presentation

873
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:17,830
and it starts in the stuff okay i'm
wrong. the sample was not the newest one

874
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:21,180
is probably that all the sport that
could be

875
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,230
this could be a decoy basically they

876
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:28,450
up all these two fires total it's not
uncommon for this kind of companies

877
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:33,740
harm our hearts are still a portal fires
total to see what is the detection rates

878
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,419
it could be a customized version some
clients want to the

879
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,610
different Russia not be detected

880
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:44,160
I don't know it is then that
characteristic of

881
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,520
20 Jones active the at all the other
samples there

882
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,190
or as so that could tell you something
about being that the Corey or

883
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:56,260
are not it does a lower serial number

884
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:00,020
and there's another sample which is be
clear too easy to

885
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,150
which was the Word document with an
exploit

886
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,030
that was being delivered to to people
which has an entire sample

887
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:12,190
ir serial number two of the sample don't
ever see remember

888
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:16,820
they were the first wireless discovered
then there's the

889
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,040
we have to visit the which has the the
highest serial number and then there are

890
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,160
these simple

891
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,420
which was the like this one from that as
the low or serial number

892
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,630
this is the order will where when they
were fine

893
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,780
I think this is the to order the sample
that I should deal with the latest one

894
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,100
is the oldest one

895
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,460
then the we get to raise the next one

896
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,030
and other tool character and he was
quite

897
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,870
sling they are still bowling from 2012

898
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,420
all the samples because the the first
two were detected

899
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,230
into Solar Inc wealth some texts

900
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,610
about this simple the contains the

901
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,740
section the jump table section with
something happens we've

902
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,359
older by a reason its link against the
GCC

903
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,790
which city is not urges he is not do
that anymore

904
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:12,370
in there in Xcode Apple the prey to the

905
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:18,109
totally there's only claim so these
compile we've been over for some and

906
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,000
this particular

907
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,640
the binary yeah I was there and I got
interested in okay let's see why I'm

908
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,560
risk or what

909
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,930
where do that failed and I started using
over

910
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:29,980
and

911
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:33,789
exco versions I have a huge archive of
these that the test is tough

912
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:38,010
and this particular layouts only happens
with an old version

913
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,589
exco pre .1 .4 although

914
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:44,730
in the all the 10.59

915
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,369
leopards compile on that system because
the

916
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:49,500
going for

917
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,940
a when you compile compiled against a
link or so

918
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,720
am different versions will produce
different primers

919
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,209
it's compiled against that and .5 SPK

920
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,370
could for example new RX colds

921
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,600
and the tree 2006 we the same STK

922
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,890
does not compile a a binary like these
so these minor was compiled by Christina

923
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:16,089
in an old machine or an old the aim the

924
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:19,560
it was targeting a know for sure of my
chorus

925
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,630
so this is a very good keep that the
sample lease

926
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,450
rate Holt disease

927
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:29,470
them for other miners

928
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,990
the X cool there's a on option

929
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:36,830
that tells you these these binary can
only run in a certain

930
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:41,930
the meaning of course her can is only X
or Y

931
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,899
and so on two of the samples ever
minimum portion of

932
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,319
10.26 switches Snow Leopard and another
sample

933
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:54,119
the lighter so the symbols are targeting

934
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,630
different systems and if you run the

935
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:02,000
10.72 cannot be used against for
examples whole effort started

936
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,819
the system will refuse to run sold is a

937
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:08,190
take that the samples are the

938
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:12,730
located difference in time I doubt they
are compiling the

939
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:15,539
customized against targets because you
don't it don't make these

940
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:18,710
and they are not using any special
features that the band's

941
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:24,400
are now on his fortunes so it's probably
the advancing our next call and combine

942
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,329
different wineries

943
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:30,539
the new wineries in the latest ones the
latest ones they are not using anymore

944
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:33,970
empress so I guess the gave up

945
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,019
the probably at some problems or
something like this:

946
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:41,399
the they move from the binary
configuration file to jason is my theory

947
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,460
is correct

948
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:46,380
the are they are playing around with
different portions

949
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,019
a are releasing the conversions are
customizing versions

950
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:54,749
a I have no idea about this because my
sample set is very small

951
00:57:54,749 --> 00:57:58,450
I only have four samples assuming

952
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:01,680
and everything I told he always plays
through

953
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,910
there are no new public sample seems to
solve the name

954
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:08,529
twelfth so we ever to your leg where we
were

955
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:11,940
don't know anything the about these at
least team Mike

956
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:17,230
in and in like hey if you have the
samples there please send me I will

957
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,950
be confidential about that hand there

958
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:26,200
it would be very nice first the samples
these not the beach

959
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:32,109
because a I'm trying to develop a good
solution

960
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:34,650
everywhere the everyone everyone is
talking about

961
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:41,040
these the a view model is broken if we
have a two-year

962
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,190
the if this to your knowledge gap
through these he cannot work because

963
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,950
we have we don't know in the sink we
cannot create AV signatures

964
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:53,180
we don't know how it behaves so

965
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:57,279
I doubt that anyone using an easy these
days

966
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,140
is protected against the new version if
they are releasing new versions

967
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,810
this is a big problem the of the AV

968
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:10,390
hey I'm working on our payroll solution
and I'm not sure if peace is the best

969
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:11,129
solution

970
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,339
I'm trying hey let's see how it goes

971
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:17,599
my I hope that there will be cable l2

972
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,650
catch the new samples using behavioral
analysis

973
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:25,460
and hopefully gets protect people and
get some insights

974
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:30,960
on on on the new fortunes I'm not so we
also can't stuffing Fisher

975
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,730
and because no one has that sample up

976
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,880
some speculation are making fun of
taking team

977
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,960
seemingly every knowledge care the and a
new samples P

978
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,900
really better a I don't think it's that
they don't have the skills

979
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,180
if you see the presentation artificial a
presentation at three car

980
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:54,098
the Windows version is not much better
than these for example they created the

981
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:54,750
back here

982
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:58,320
that he's really claim really easy the

983
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,660
equals boys was telling me attacking me
this is bullshit that I don't care

984
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,700
anymore about these guys because he's

985
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,149
lebudde so that I don't think they have
the the really the skills

986
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:13,560
I don't believe that they create to the
team and careers of

987
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,970
top person is that and really develop
something

988
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:20,950
for stills if you look at the league the
slights from gamma

989
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:24,200
grammys much better they have much
better technology

990
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,250
and the guy that struck down a was the
guy that started

991
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:32,150
backtrack so they are much better the
their car technology is much better

992
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:36,060
and is probably one of the reasons why
we don't sell have samples of thing

993
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:36,630
Fisher

994
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:40,370
the word the zoo was just send them

995
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:44,170
making fun they were saying oh we are
going to have fun in private

996
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:48,610
I hope they have fun I will continue to
chase them and make fun of them

997
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:52,560
soon polls fairer

998
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:56,230
just give it to me that's Italian
cooking style

999
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:01,250
their funny stuff but you can see in the
binary for example they do something

1000
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,800
like this they get the

1001
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,990
government to borrow whole the al-qaeda
ATA

1002
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:11,319
exit this small bites whatever number
this is an

1003
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,740
have a stand by its they'll look back
buffer

1004
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:18,629
and they always bring their one that's
right for ISO

1005
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:21,800
they basically yes an overflow here

1006
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,520
these shows you their context I'll it is
really a

1007
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,870
crack and you are is like to upgrade old
school for ability

1008
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:34,029
an overflowing with an environment where

1009
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,420
where he is on the always know the ls1

1010
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,510
paper one way to and

1011
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:46,090
overflow where and my first love for new
stuff for example they

1012
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:48,310
get that you mention name and

1013
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:52,070
when they are looking for the images
they they can get the mentioning

1014
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,910
on a bus or a

1015
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,910
air 10 instead of using that imagining
that buffer

1016
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,328
they Cole the name I can decide the
binary

1017
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:04,530
is really stupid stuff the new

1018
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:07,940
not very important but it shows you
where the detail

1019
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,030
their style is these shows is that they

1020
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:16,329
they don't ever and how to say they
don't care about the details

1021
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:19,619
a at least for me the details this tells
me it

1022
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:22,980
there was a really just want something
that works

1023
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,240
and get all the money and that's it

1024
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:26,848
is wired
