1
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,629
over again but I really looking forward
to the stock so tell me I

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:14,629
given another round of applause and
welcome

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,210
okay so I'm Brian the

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,750
as you can see the talk is titled a
hundred twelve years a vulnerability is

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,930
as someone pointed out already the
schedule set a 111 so we have a rod a

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,169
that and how time moves forward a action
started

7
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:34,160
working on this presentation and gave it
for the first time I'll last September

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,819
but as a real small group and I've been
kinda building on it since then

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,570
this is a talk about perspective it's
not a technical talk so you have to take

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,290
notes

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,890
hi hopefully I mean it's awesome stories
I'll amuse you and now I'm

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,050
at the end all see where we end up com
first

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,390
few quick rules I if you have questions
please wait till the end

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,550
I if I'm wrong about something go ahead
and boarded out

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,559
if I'm actually wrong i buy you beer all
night long hi

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,559
if I'm right and you're wrong can you
buy me beer so

17
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,399
even warned I for those familiar with my
presenting in the past you know that I'm

18
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:09,720
usually a bulletin chart kind of guy

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,300
that presentation style does not work
for this talk really

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,220
and session see also: we can't really
believe any stats

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,240
quick disclaimer that was legally
binding thank you

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,649
com we're all adults here right here

23
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,490
okay so those are the rules Who Am I on

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,390
I'm just a guy who likes more
misunderstood creatures for those who

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,890
know me

26
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,959
yeah I'm that the guy like squirrels in
guinea pigs and everything

27
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,479
but the part that matters is I click
things have always been a collector even

28
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,170
as a kid

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,489
I'm in this matters because right now I
clicked vulnerabilities but this is

30
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,630
actually out-of-date already

31
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,068
and I have to do this two days ago so
we're over it 106 1800 three wheeler

32
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,770
billy's

33
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,580
I 85,000 products almost over 112 years

34
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,649
and that's kind of interesting to see
those numbers and we're getting the

35
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,670
that lamar later why those numbers are
probably all wrong to

36
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,390
so what went into preparing for this
talk

37
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,110
the I read a lot of articles I'm these
kind of articles

38
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,520
they're fascinating to read and then
when you go digging past that you get

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,700
even more information

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,819
how to read a all kinds of fun papers
from back then

41
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,010
I not sure if you can't quite read those
dates but those are all

42
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,989
early seventies also me a lot of old
people when the industry and said hey

43
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,849
man I don't use your day launcher

44
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,858
10,000 a I had a lot of great people
respond in gimme some perspective there

45
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:35,609
not a written books for those of you who
don't know

46
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:38,849
there's actually a ton of security books
from back in the seventies

47
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:43,260
I have 12 to 15 of them now fascinating
reads because ninety percent what they

48
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,730
saying

49
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,358
you could just change the date all
accurate I

50
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:51,629
this is going to be a depressing talk at
first we're all gonna be saddened me

51
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,200
mine are why do we bother

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,140
I hopefully by the end no will change
your perspective and you'll be a little

53
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,890
happier

54
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,379
on we know the stated the industry right
now

55
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,980
a we're not very good at what we do we
think we are but in the long run

56
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,510
a hopefully this is going to be more
historical perspective to fully

57
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,879
understand and appreciate exactly where
we are

58
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,319
and with that perspective maybe do
better I'm

59
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,939
for those who know this quote those
cannot remember the past are condemned

60
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,120
to repeat it

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,689
this is a very appropriate quote for our
industry

62
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:28,989
I'm this is also by the way attributed
to I

63
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,980
sheppard Burke gonna get and Jesse
Ventura bit there's actually I said it

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,429
I when do

65
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,689
when his vulnerability history start ten
years ago

66
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,739
if you ask me I woulda said maybe the
nineteen sixties because we can

67
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,939
associate some other early computers
back then

68
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,388
have about five years ago I said no
maybe 250 is

69
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,980
three years ago Amanda said the thirties
now I think a better time to start is

70
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,119
1902

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,290
on then when you think about what the
world was like in 1902 it's a very

72
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,209
different world

73
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,420
then we live in now obviously on
important part in choosing such a date

74
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,439
is remember that it's

75
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,549
kind over on it's a little bit about
perspective it is also

76
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,560
crossing privilege boundaries which
we're all familiar with you know

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,329
basically what

78
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,669
makes up a vulnerability or an exploit
on

79
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,190
so that in mind we start with the
Marconi wireless Telegraph

80
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,070
the back in the day here everything was
wired and then one day Marconi says

81
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,550
hey we're gonna be my more information
out over the wires which

82
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,630
is pretty familiar to us today I'm it
was amended in the years leading up to

83
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,490
1903 was a significant advance at the
time

84
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,660
and made by significant advance I mean
you know

85
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,900
there's news about everything the
primary crater was an Italian name

86
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,789
glioma marconi get assistance John
Ambrose Fleming

87
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,680
pictured and Arthur block and I really
feel bad for block I couldn't find a

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,950
picture up on

89
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,760
and I'm sad because he was actually a
more central part to this story than

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,469
anyone

91
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,100
he was kinda like the hacker in the room
yet he doesn't getting the credit

92
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,210
the so %um marconi

93
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,380
like security vendors today in I he
claimed his device was secure

94
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,490
and his messages were private and he
boasted I can tune my instrument so that

95
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,150
no other instrument that is not some
early tonight can tap my messages

96
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,560
he basically said you can eavesdrop on
my stuff I okay

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,130
so watch office new device he said a
public demonstration he got the news

98
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,070
there

99
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,469
I was in this big theater he was in
Cornwall

100
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,580
300 miles away himself buddy at is a to
assistance in the theater with all the

101
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,820
media and the people

102
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,920
now kinda like a hacker he was like
Antonio people the

103
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,930
so right before the the message he was
sending

104
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,960
came in his assistant block

105
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,250
curtail we're tapping in the lantern
just like a raveling

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,600
he's like something's wrong something's
weird about this

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,050
you know how it is you typing when you
like an idiot your matrix style

108
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,870
ten-block said wait a minute that's
Morse code he thought about his like

109
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,420
wait a minute how is this lantern

110
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,590
rattling off Morse code he figured out
someone's beating in the room signal

111
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,830
and it was a Marconi so

112
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,460
block listens and he listens and he
realizes saying one word over and over

113
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,409
rats crafts rats

114
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,610
kinda weird but he knew what was going
on be shortly after that came the

115
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,640
sure enough crude insults and personal
attacks against marconi

116
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,240
you know true troll style I marconi
wasn't happy about this

117
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,580
on the entire demonstration was kinda
flop

118
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,789
the like some security vendors today
though Marconi said I will not

119
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,620
demonstrate any man who throws doubt
upon the system

120
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,140
basically a you found a bug in my stuff
backing to talk to you

121
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,250
your you're just wrong just trust me up

122
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,450
paper free booze this a great up

123
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,050
you about okay she's me

124
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,590
and so you basically said the I'm not
gonna wasn't here

125
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,489
you're silly bugs or whatever his main
man climbing though

126
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,210
picture later might he wasn't so you
know rigid about that

127
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,820
he's in a few min letter to the times of
london dubbing the hack

128
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,550
scientific hooliganism which is an
awesome term think about it

129
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,180
next time you wanna fun card for your
business but that is your titled

130
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,190
and so much like the vendors today
screaming that's not all are believed to

131
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,500
design feature

132
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,790
the you know plumbing basically

133
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,290
said the same thing and he in tried to
enlist the paper to say

134
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,870
hey help me find out who did this
fortunately for him for days later a

135
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,830
different letter

136
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,909
came to the times it was gleeful and
confessed to the entire hack

137
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,690
it so we have probably the world's first
modern hacker that we know

138
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,210
this fine mustache gentlemen is a stage
magician and inventor

139
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,169
that's kinda like the you know forefront
packing right I'm he decided to troll

140
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,180
marconi in shown that is notions a
private were a joke

141
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,270
I am so this is John Noble mask 1

142
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,580
I'm Marconi's patented technology for
broadcasting on that precise wavelength

143
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,330
or whatever

144
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,530
it was shattered before it even went to
market so

145
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,299
we kinda look today and say you know a
vendor comes out something in beta

146
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,440
and it just gets demolished that's
basically what happened here

147
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,500
but this also games the first two motor
abilities that I have in the database

148
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,870
that I am manage

149
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,630
I'm we have a transmitted message remote
disclosure basically sniffing the air

150
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,330
waves

151
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,570
and also a spiffing weakness you know to
hold abilities were pretty familiar with

152
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,409
most of the stories that we read in
there but the story actually goes deeper

153
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,809
a masked man was apparently hired by the
eastern Telegraph Company

154
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,458
to undertake spying operations on
Marconi a year before all of this

155
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,349
so yeah there's all kinds the drama and
intrigue behind us which is cool

156
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,629
I'm the cool part masked men had written
this article in November 7 1902

157
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,879
in the electric chair and think Google I
actually found

158
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,509
original on not copy the ritual
obviously

159
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,910
the where he disclosed everything he did

160
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,910
so marconi boasted about his security
the whole time the entire

161
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,860
exploit was written into publication
that he presumably should have read

162
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,449
and you compare that today with the
issues a full disclosure and hackers and

163
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:14,378
trolls

164
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:18,529
in everything here is just you know
common to us

165
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,560
a so it's a neat story I want to dig
into it a little more

166
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,670
is probably all kinds of fun info there

167
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,050
so now we jumped to the basically the
world war two era

168
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,579
I actually started as far as the the
vulnerability side

169
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:35,589
in the 1920s through the forties I'm a
lot of countries

170
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,999
we're using electromechanical rotor
ciphers Huang hears me with the in that

171
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,970
market that's one that most people know

172
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,720
yeah I basically the enigma and several
other machines

173
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,449
cement in many by a German engineer on
who is used

174
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:54,139
except when he's the forties in a
variety of ways

175
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:57,810
the first break I love the jar German
army and that my because they had for

176
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,149
models was by

177
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,769
a three polish cog refers on

178
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,670
for 100 years key u-verse engineer the
device using theoretical mathematics and

179
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,180
material from french military
intelligence

180
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,569
so using a combination of the actual
intelligence and math

181
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:17,009
he figured out how the device worked he
kinda built his own prototype ovett

182
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:20,939
and broke it which is pretty cool on
over the coming years subsequent models

183
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:21,709
would-be

184
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:25,508
designed used and broken in the same
manner

185
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:29,089
I in Japan we have the ninety-seven
chicky open in Jackie

186
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:33,290
sorry for the conciliation if its way of
I went to hear my friends later

187
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,579
I means alphabetical typewriter 97

188
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,189
but we don't remember that so one thing
that the crypto world does really good

189
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:43,420
these code names what is called is
purple on

190
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,870
and purple intercept diplomatic
transmissions Doug magic

191
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,199
I sneezy I just came in 1937 after the
ninety one chicken jerky

192
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:55,689
AKA red that had significant weaknesses
on

193
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:00,529
nineteen forty this is broken by a US
as-is team

194
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,699
then we had the Siemens T-fifty to get
him Schreiber could name

195
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:09,219
sturgeon I may nineteen forty crack by
the sweetness in the Swedes had one huge

196
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,589
a leg up on all of their counterparts

197
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,439
they can actually tap the hard-line and
get all of the communications from one

198
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:16,639
of these devices

199
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,779
so when you do in the cryptanalysis if
you are able to get that much material

200
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:21,449
it just makes it

201
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:25,040
easier to break you choosing

202
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,849
then we all said the Laurens SZ 40 SC 42
abe et cetera et cetera

203
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,339
the cracked in 1942 we're gonna call
this one tiny

204
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:37,699
an order not we can think this will be
ready for the entire world we know

205
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:42,998
on was the first computer built anyone

206
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:46,970
first computer come on right nor wrong

207
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,279
right everyone thinks that the eniac
it's not is actually

208
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,499
the Colossus on the closest game three
years before

209
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:58,040
the difference is that when someone says
he is the first digital computer

210
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,370
this was the first single purpose
computer this thing did one

211
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,709
task and it broke crypto come
interesting

212
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:08,899
on sohn forty-three I was built

213
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:12,550
and for how many years all it did was
break crypto

214
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,079
I for these machines this was nine feet
high

215
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,258
16 feet long ten feet wide drew 5500
what's up our

216
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:24,259
and is about as powerful as your
fountain

217
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,100
the nineteen fifties hi gives rise to
the phone phreaks

218
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,490
mister this mayor with the the later
history of phones

219
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,660
I'm but we have to remember that they
really devices the switches were

220
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,949
electromechanical

221
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:38,959
and eventually they would evolve into
digital computers

222
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,018
you and 55 the Western Electric labs
panel machine switching system had an

223
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:44,720
issue

224
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,939
it predated the classic blue box by by
several years

225
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:52,349
I user-supplied input 1000 megahertz

226
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,529
modulated signal would see the trunk
between two cities

227
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,329
with that trunk they could basically
talked to the remote and say hey

228
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,128
operator connect be somewhere

229
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,379
and they would get the free long
distance there and then connected

230
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,369
outbound

231
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:08,519
so you had your first freaking
essentially use in that kinda

232
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,009
methodology

233
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:13,730
actual freaking goes back to fifty the
sixty years when the linemen what

234
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,990
happened to the

235
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:20,079
the hardwire time in 56 the Western
Electric crossbar

236
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,128
general telephone Stroger a step-by-step
they suffer from a different issue

237
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:27,759
expert at the time was known as a black
box for you freaks who came up in the

238
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,360
seventies and eighties this was a
different black box

239
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,800
hi there's a race condition I you pick
up your phone

240
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,479
islamic down any do this several times
really quick and the remote system would

241
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,249
be like whoa wait a minute are you on
her

242
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:42,680
of of I don't know what you are and it
would

243
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,388
not kick in the billing system so if he
did this in the right order or you know

244
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,089
it the right

245
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:50,619
frequency you pick up your next calls
free

246
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:54,089
and you

247
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,749
for perspective real quick all of this
happen before her why became a state

248
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:01,959
so we think about the history of
computers and vulnerabilities

249
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,579
you know most people like I said they
can go back to the sixties or seventies

250
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,719
on 1962 Western Electric labs for a
crossbar

251
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,610
this is the infamous blue box review old
enough that actually built or use the

252
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,119
blue box in here

253
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:21,119
anyone statute limitations is up come on

254
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:27,170
yep at I'm so the blue box carefully
timed 2600 towns and we're all three

255
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,019
were 2600 now because that

256
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,899
work for you musicians it's the seventh
ought to be. are you sure that down the

257
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:33,569
line is

258
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:37,118
but remote switch into thinking the
trunk is free free call

259
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:41,339
on and that's where the phone company
learned the hard way that user input was

260
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,480
a bitch

261
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,709
the and we still have this problem today
don't weigh

262
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,998
so over the years people figured out the
toys and electronics could be used to

263
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:50,939
circumvent

264
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:54,790
system make free calls the the freaks
would

265
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,248
it to the end up abusing the system for
over a decade well into the seventies

266
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:02,670
I'm so like is that toys Davy Crockett's

267
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,709
Burke of loot mile one other early
freaks he figured out that as you kinda

268
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:07,689
modulated

269
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:10,649
you could do it at the right one to hit
the frequency needed real fascinating

270
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,649
stuff

271
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,860
good you recognize these criminals

272
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,170
day on yeah this is jobs and now wozniak

273
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,329
while they came much later it gets a
recognizable visual

274
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,050
high for the bees the phone systems and
reminds us that some of our computer

275
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,490
Empire today was built on crime

276
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,350
come another neat little side history
thing I've been researching for a while

277
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,389
sahnoun the computer history were
familiar with and by that I mean you're

278
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:39,290
officially we look up and we say yes
that's a computer

279
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,809
you the nineteen sixties brought Israel
multi-user machines and that's why

280
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,189
a lot of people associate vulnerability
history back this far

281
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:50,779
I once again privilege escalation
privilege brown DRI's

282
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:55,259
crossing them on this is IBM 7094

283
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,449
the first multi use a computer system
that I'm aware of that has

284
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:02,449
saw for vulnerabilities resulting in
privilege escalation of some kind

285
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:05,469
you can these came from 62 and 65

286
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,910
I actually the 66 one other interesting
ones is there was an offline printing

287
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,660
issue

288
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,800
the any she's me I when a user made a
request to

289
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,899
like if they just requested the password
file computer system like know when I

290
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:19,819
can give you that

291
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,849
but they said hey computer system print
that file

292
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,170
puncture so would put the password found
they could run to the printing cabin if

293
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,368
they were the first one there

294
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:32,290
that every user's password on notta
lotta security behind that we know

295
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,029
I am overall a in the world of own
abilities and the sixties were a blip on

296
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:37,970
the radar

297
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,839
on the seventies bars a lot of fun on
yes that does the robot: Ron

298
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,019
no its not the cork eight-game a on

299
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,199
this is a German company called a GTR
that made that

300
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,059
I'm and then we get the games you know
who grew up with organ trail

301
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,449
minus yep pretty much everyone in here
should raise your hand on that one

302
00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:00,229
the so organ trail this is kind of a
little cheap for me to get in the

303
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,389
presentation because

304
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,319
organ trio was mostly a single user game
however toward the in a bit history

305
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,629
could actually play it over

306
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,429
TTY terminals and phone lines and there
was kind of a multi-user element

307
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,439
I'm so anyway it was like seven or eight
year olds figured out what happens if I

308
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,660
put in -100 for the number

309
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,019
and less money you know I what we call
that today

310
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,909
under flows manager overflows under
Fozia

311
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:33,850
so seven-year-olds figure this out
before we did work or I'm

312
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,559
who hears work on a PDP 10

313
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,789
who's actually seen one in the field
yeah come on

314
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:44,408
they're still used today primarily
financials and that's kinda scary

315
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:48,519
and manufactured 66 I was actually
carried in the eighties

316
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,679
like I said there's still a few out
there in the running mission-critical

317
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:51,799
systems

318
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,418
panic on that one ran 12 operating
systems either a top 10 or 10 X

319
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,679
and 72 there was a timing attack
tolerability allow the user to figure

320
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,260
out

321
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,269
different users password I'm and it's
important to note that this was a true

322
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:05,440
timing attack

323
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,100
against virtual memory paging this is
like really advanced because

324
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,879
what do we use timing attacks for today
almost nothing

325
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,350
when the timing attack is disclosed most
vulnerable the databases we read in

326
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,928
Psych

327
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,419
yeah it's quite academic got the radical
now no one's ever going to use as

328
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,529
but is actually use back in the day

329
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:27,909
mom kinda makes you wonder made all
these timing attacks were dismissing

330
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:28,980
left and right

331
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,789
do they really have a lot more merit
than we understand on

332
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:37,590
Honeywell DPS it running G Coast three
or general comprehensive operating

333
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,519
system

334
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,149
972 to vulnerabilities were discovered
and another in 79

335
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:46,809
one was to abuse the TS FORTRAN compiler
to execute commands outside the security

336
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,129
envelope

337
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,500
outside the security envelope this is
also sounding kinda familiar to me

338
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,720
on calhoun was a file system module

339
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,940
I'm not handling butler's buffers
allowing for disclosure bar but your

340
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,620
user credentials

341
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,590
and destruction notice a theme with the
people wanting other passwords

342
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,080
a the tutor programming language was
developed after the play dough for

343
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,620
computer system nice

344
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,080
sleek aerodynamic machine right there on

345
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,260
you watched out of here you might with a
cracked a txt command sent to a remote

346
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,830
terminal you could lock it up

347
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,149
and require a power reset to fix it

348
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:28,600
so now we have our first remote and I'll
service going back that far

349
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,590
1974 39 years old

350
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,620
hi MIT's Honeywell 6180 one of many
computers around more pics

351
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,219
who hears actually used more text before

352
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,610
we're gonna have a talk you keep raising
your hand and on

353
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,269
actually there's an entire website
called multitudes .org all the all the

354
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,470
you know geezers the get together and
talk about malt expand their body of

355
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,940
knowledge

356
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,000
is incredible it's fun talking this
guy's I'm in the seventies or

357
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,330
at least 16 vulnerabilities and more
pics and I'd like to point out that when

358
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,908
I first gave this talkin

359
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,440
election November 2013 I only had 10

360
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,929
so in the past happy year have gotten
six more multi colour abilities

361
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,419
and that tells us that there are
probably a whole lot more before that

362
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,639
on statistically not X was kinda that
work love the nineteen seventies

363
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:21,529
with him on a vulnerability that had on
I'm not an apologist or call for Alan

364
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:26,190
a early 1979 anyone recognize him

365
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,289
trucker shell he is basically like the
patron saint

366
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,629
love pen testing as far as anyone should
be concerned

367
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,159
he led a tiger team all at Naval
Postgraduate School nom

368
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,070
he did this on behalf of the military
the US military and I he did it against

369
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,620
the market operating system

370
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,729
so during the test not only did they
find vulnerabilities

371
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,409
and find more vulnerabilities I
something else interesting happen

372
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:55,269
they wanted I like a lot of black boxing
age means they wanted persist in access

373
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:56,639
to this machine

374
00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:00,350
so they put a backdoor on it right who
hears back toward something for

375
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,168
can't ask a lot of us have on sometimes
it's fair game sometimes it's not

376
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:08,889
China may come to find out it wasn't
just a military

377
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:12,580
not exit was actually the Honeywell
machine

378
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,590
running the master copy of multidex so
he back toward the vendors copy

379
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,389
yeah that's kinda serious so being an
upstanding guy

380
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:26,240
his team went to anyone said oh hey we
put a backdoor on your system please

381
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,090
remove it

382
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,799
and they said okay im he described
didn't like about this is how many lines

383
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,220
we use dove code which was

384
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,620
next to nothing this is you know the
magic password where we can get full

385
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,539
access

386
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:39,539
and Honeywell said you know banks making
back to my turn said

387
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,049
still can't find it that's not very
comforting

388
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:46,070
on so this one back and forth to bed and

389
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,418
eventually Honeywell said screw it and
it started shipping that back door with

390
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,799
every copy of Malta afterwards

391
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,049
I'm so in 1979 we have our first

392
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,590
US government back toward operating
system

393
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,279
yep right now we're all panicking over
that thought you know was it ninety

394
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,380
40004 loathing intiki and

395
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,519
Windows NT her you know the the in SAT

396
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,220
yet we had a game here on

397
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,389
what action racing in did I guess the
three days leading up to this I was

398
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:19,209
doing more digging

399
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,700
this is the second time they back toward
more texts and they did it to Honeywell

400
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,389
the first time it was fortunately for us
a harmless a backdoor

401
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:33,918
I mileage may vary on that one so
whatcha up to the model +91 IBM 360

402
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,889
IBM 360 this one is used at nasa and we
know that because it has way too many

403
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:39,649
buttons

404
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:43,529
on Iran OS 360 13 variance

405
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,110
74 published on Everett access
restriction bypass

406
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,178
but cool part about 316 is that the
software still used today

407
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,450
I'm not only are there are few and he's
like mainframe still floating around

408
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,000
IBM support to treat disease series
computer to like

409
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,070
your day to day when we're monitoring
vulnerabilities for the database

410
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,760
we see stuff in the series however more
fascinating

411
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,860
between 1964 in 2005

412
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,600
when this thing was used one
vulnerability and aunt

413
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,428
by those numbers this is probably
statistically the most secure operating

414
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:19,990
system in the world

415
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,990
Kunkel course it's also won the most
unusable one

416
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,919
unfriendly bed me know by this reason

417
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,960
that this doesn't catch on Bahia

418
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,799
ok up go back to be a mess I think I

419
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,019
if now say upwards I'm so

420
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:41,059
a after 2005 moment they kinda
modernized it and made it

421
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:46,250
0s the then the floodgates open in 33
vulnerabilities were found since then

422
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,380
ca1 vulnerability up to 2005 10:33 after

423
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,159
I so something to be said for the the
hardware runs on I guess

424
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,549
this is a PDP 11 it took him college in
78 on R&R STS

425
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:01,269
multi-user time sharing the list from
Dec a

426
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:04,620
in 75 for vulnerabilities were
identified including to now service

427
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,768
are better user credential disclosure
fathers closure and in

428
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:11,559
unspecified remote issue with the login
process

429
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,570
and that last bit to a former Billy
historian is very interesting

430
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,149
onto rather than full disclosure we have
limited disclosure from the admins a

431
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:20,820
system we saw the vulnerability

432
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,879
actively being used so this was detected
in the wild

433
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,940
and they said we don't want to share the
full details with everyone

434
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,100
so historically this is probably the
first time someone said

435
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,610
well full disclosure may not be the way
to go

436
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:43,139
comments repeat on the left by the way
and crusade geeks are sexy look at that

437
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:47,799
as your ox 560 people were running CPV
which he probably run sincere and

438
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,610
everything else

439
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,959
I'm in 75 owner believes found that
allow the user to bypass the built-in

440
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,519
memory protection to elevate privileges

441
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,610
yeah around a lot of quick but bypass
the built-in memory protection to

442
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,070
elevate privileges

443
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,678
and that sounds a little bit like a
sandbox

444
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,830
on if you don't think memory protection
bypass a serious

445
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,600
I consider that 33 years later hasn't
security gave a talk titled

446
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,959
how to impress girls with browser memory
protection bypass

447
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,380
so 33 years ago ahead of the game

448
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,919
pp 11 a.m. anyone recognizes to

449
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,919
money probably work with them Dennis
Ritchie and I can Thomson

450
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,019
name should be familiar there the
modern-day competing heroes

451
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:36,019
creators have UNIX I which is the basis
for

452
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:40,149
basically every modern keep operating
system other than Windows

453
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:43,428
hey I X HPI Rex PST Apple Mac

454
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:46,679
per Mac OS X unico slim X

455
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,149
me know I even under the Android

456
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:54,370
I in 1975 an unspecified vulnerability
was found in the login process related

457
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,418
to a rate checking

458
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,960
so again we have another big disclosure
this time from HP Labs

459
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,490
so yeah we know HP labs for doing I want
the bug bounties

460
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,960
they happen you know be into this long
before that even

461
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,960
a that may have been when the first
vendor disclosures if you count them as

462
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,610
a vendor

463
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,959
even though they probably didn't really
own

464
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,870
I the software six years later there was
another v6 UNIX v6

465
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,418
issue found in the issue program on
after that

466
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,509
dozens and dozens more vulnerabilities
would be found in UNIX

467
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:30,679
so the floodgates kinda opened on that
one

468
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,250
a/c IBM 370 punch card system part of a
larger computer system Iran

469
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:40,309
I wanna four different operating systems
in 77 privilege escalation and 79 a

470
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:41,730
password file disclosure

471
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,100
at this point we have to keep looking
back wire these password disclosures

472
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,600
popping up every single time why are we
still using passwords to this day

473
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,668
when it just doesn't work year after
year

474
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:56,990
on for the math people in the audience
crypto people

475
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,220
new day to see a lower grade them based
on new super created by course by

476
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,110
stalin's colleagues at IBM

477
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,979
on this was a commercial cipher I before
this for military ciphers

478
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,429
the details are kinda fuzzy but I'm
working on I a whole lotta reading in

479
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,429
bikinis to be done and I'm not a math
guy

480
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:16,259
so it's basically read two pages drink
you know 32 pages drink

481
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,399
stop next day you can I process so much
about it on a map person

482
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,459
so is 77 the NDS Sypher was comparable
to a slight attack report

483
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,840
resulting in a for compromise com twenty
early computer based algorithms FL

484
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,840
want it back would be one of hundreds
following it including I'd s

485
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,250
which we all know and love on so by the
seventies

486
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,309
vulnerabilities were coming up more and
more often

487
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:44,039
and summit the some other people out
there were concerned about this

488
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,259
especially the military he said wait a
minute you know thanks largely new

489
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,470
computers

490
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,440
their smaller believes that can write an
hour not too happy about that

491
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,389
on back in Mistborn security people they
were admittance

492
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:59,508
they would spend all their hours just
keep in a machine running

493
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:02,620
and back then it wasn't recompile the
kernel and everything's good

494
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,129
it was actually you know what day in
struggle to keep that machine physically

495
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:06,969
running

496
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,759
on so by the eighties Bowl abilities
were so prevail and

497
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,840
on some people decided it was time
should be maintained and these kind of

498
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,970
where the early voter Billy databases

499
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,360
its kinda lease term to me before Billy
databases

500
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,428
Getty collection of bones I don't care
how little are more

501
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:26,450
a much information you conclude about
them

502
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,500
accounts a they were different today's
but the same untangle

503
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,720
catalog all the vulnerabilities I before
the eighties the original BBB was likely

504
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,850
the repaired security bugs in Malta X
mom

505
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,230
this was from 77 so yeah when I was
digging around already had some modicum

506
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,980
on Iran to cross reference to this

507
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,519
I was like ball he is the holy grail to
a phone story and I'm like

508
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,759
wall gotta have this on so yeah I

509
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,230
go online and there's your views Nike I
got a review this when I'm done

510
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,539
which has Tom and done was kinda
disappointing you

511
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:01,970
I'm the gym the image that you saying

512
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,309
it's actually I later found out a
generic image that Google Books use

513
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:08,940
so was actually a book site but a
letdown on

514
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,210
gonna have to get it a so I said you
know

515
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,200
but one copy and Amazon didn't have it
ebooks didn't have it

516
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,610
and said Bob the library they've gotta
have it right

517
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,370
940 miles away Anya who wants to go to
California

518
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,580
on so logical reserve response

519
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,629
was quite upset at that mom but

520
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,820
things got better the when I get this
presentation to like

521
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,960
eight people last year and I you can
when the

522
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,720
professors their ci dunno a request in
in trouble

523
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,100
library request to whatever AM I had a
copy waiting for me

524
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,320
ended up being six pages was in a book
calm but

525
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,240
ultimately I got my six more more text
bug so it was a whim hominem

526
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,100
I get this presentation last week says
we're on the topic and now I'm

527
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,250
again it was a group a twenty people
will private deal and afterwards guy

528
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,330
comes up and he's like you know lol

529
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,080
II military history knows like a you
some pretty cool on is like well you

530
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,418
know I work for this one group as a an
essay in

531
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:10,309
you know he's using these like vague
words like you know then I did support

532
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,019
for this only

533
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,059
the agency and then I did this not like
Spec Ops okay

534
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:17,149
was like you know you're pretty badass
Senior Design Inc up to form

535
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,758
okay so he hands me two books I'm 1 a.m.

536
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,879
but what military equipment Krypton
hours

537
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:27,379
crypt and licks chart ways to pushing a
part 1 part 2

538
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:30,980
anyway part 1 all high level stuff
didn't help me

539
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,320
part 2 send their reading on the plane
reading it reading it

540
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,320
was like man I was really expecting

541
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,270
for the record it was declassified in
2005

542
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,160
well to speak on

543
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,170
28 only get to Appendix 6

544
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,100
this is like 30 pages they're going to
take me

545
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,309
30 months to go through try to figure
out so

546
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:04,379
in the span of like 20 min to talk in
this guy he's probably doubled tripled

547
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,570
or more my knowledge of

548
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,780
historical crypto machines fascinating
stuff so

549
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,030
hopefully this trend will continue in
afterwards when you call people come up

550
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,290
and say oh by the way

551
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,000
secure some great info and it's like
really old camp chart think about that

552
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,410
and

553
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:23,890
please eighties much more familiar to us
wind computer smaller

554
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,230
and more importantly to prevent
computers trying to be everywhere

555
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,929
on after repair security bugs and more
pics yet more first catalogue

556
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,330
on this came in the form a mail lists a
and

557
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,449
also concise list the bones and I'm
switching tracks a little bit here

558
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,169
because

559
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:42,240
than there were so many that had to be
catalogued

560
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,980
and when you think about it have so many
bugs exists that you need a catalog

561
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,090
number: then it should be a warning sign

562
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,720
and a lot of us back then we didn't take
it as such on

563
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,549
after the most explicit a bit late
eighties I we saw several other people

564
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:59,070
cataloging not the UNIX security may
list in 84

565
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,639
I'm at Bishop's UNIX whole list in 85

566
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,890
Rutgers in 85 Bob I L Walker Hobbit

567
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:11,040
on page may list in 88 by gene Spafford
is our dollars in eighteen on by New

568
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,870
York or such

569
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,059
those are all fascinating read you can
get almost all others may list on

570
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,350
couple sites out there are still some
missing one so if any of you are really

571
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,000
old

572
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,330
you have like four copies of those
middle schools a lot of people would be

573
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,270
your friend to get ahead cocky but

574
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,340
on there was also additional is like the
UNIX known problem list the UC Santa

575
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,780
Cruz hack method list

576
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,870
and there's also an alleged internal Sun
Microsystems bug list

577
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,219
that had all the exploits to go with
their bugs which had

578
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,679
would be really cool to get my hands on
political mud casper deak I think

579
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,230
on so there's other ones that I got my
hands on

580
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:51,130
Dorking on integrating buckle parties
all these people working on doing the

581
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,160
same thing that I do

582
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,720
so they're kinda my heroes I in the
early nineties I was following in her

583
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,490
footsteps

584
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,690
I mean I was only player with some
others list I was happily with hacker

585
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,690
group back in the day

586
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,770
on and like any good hacker group we
maintain our list the bugs

587
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,970
this is it I'll well kinda

588
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:12,260
you know sampling so we kept in files
not BBS poor man

589
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,110
so that we could share it easily I by
that I mean with hardly anyone just

590
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,889
a few people we knew I on the stuff like
gold back then

591
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,880
but what was interesting to me is even
back then I was using a classification

592
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,929
system what I called the OHS at guide

593
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:29,320
which told me though you know the
operating system weather is remote local

594
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,000
whatever

595
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,960
and ultimately the impact event on and
you jump to

596
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,600
a lot later when the first big BBB's
came out like I SSX portion

597
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,330
on security focus beer NCTE enemies
classification systems

598
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,699
and even though formerly Database I
worked on we don't we didn't have one

599
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,400
until

600
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,580
2004 I'm so yeah shame on us all of us

601
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,470
I and then yeah we headed the actual
those had died

602
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,880
so that you could translate that on by
this point there were dozens books on

603
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,200
security UNIX PMS boxes all over

604
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,210
their early years at the internet and
this is the entire internet

605
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,679
in one community map pack them I'm but
cool part is K Packers

606
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,040
a chance to easily get other systems and
in doing so they could explore mmm

607
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,469
and now I'm in doing so they can also
find

608
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:19,408
more more vulnerabilities even home PCs
were

609
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,220
running PBS's by this point and PBS's
had their own vulnerabilities

610
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:28,100
people don't remember that nom most are
more either I can remotely crash the BBS

611
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,810
top

612
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,600
wakes up in the ass to you know we start
the system with summer more about

613
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,259
downloading any foul on the system

614
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,490
bypassing I restrictions because if any
views these remember well I can only

615
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,319
upload like

616
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,470
3k and download 10k per 24 hours or
whatever

617
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:46,949
bypassing I was coming at believe
seventies and early eighties gave us a

618
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,710
new look at an hour service attacks

619
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,399
if you think you have a bad time dealing
with DoS attacks now

620
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,449
on this group cloud over and I'm not
gonna butcher the

621
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:58,490
long French name for that I'm

622
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,490
when I gave this talk last week the
right as I finish the slide

623
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:07,169
reno the crater Nessus walked by its
like he heard my butchering

624
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,750
kinda glared at me and he was in the
next room kinda weird

625
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,440
I'm on to rate these guys said you know

626
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,990
well we're not gonna you know some
packets to you were gonna do arson and

627
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,830
bombs

628
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,359
and they were going on blow up computer
installations it big

629
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:26,339
systems these big companies so yeah they
were pretty hardcore about their

630
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:27,369
knowledge service

631
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:31,200
in you know had a little more lasting
effect so we took to the seventies and

632
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,609
eighties and we also get her first taste

633
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:36,150
SCADA vulnerabilities in this is really
cool on

634
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:41,580
so after this one in 83 was disclosed I
would be seventeen years later before we

635
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,430
got our first K disclosure

636
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,759
it's a big jump on and mom it's a big
jump

637
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,200
the story from 83 the fascinating one so

638
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,240
a mmm

639
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,689
yeah pick up Nuclear Regulatory
Commission NRC issued in

640
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,900
information notice not advisory

641
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,390
not a critical advisory not a no shit
you should panic advisory

642
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:09,420
on number 83 83 was about portable radio
transmitters in nuclear power plants

643
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,839
seemed harmless I when you start reading
through I

644
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,460
you started to get a feel for what it
meant and it was basically

645
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,700
usual walkie-talkie stuff shuts down

646
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,069
that's not very comforting on so that
was an 83 that the issue that

647
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,720
the first incident actually occurred at
the Farley nuclear plant in 75

648
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,890
technicians figured out a different a
different role real aim

649
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,580
is radio frequency sensitive and that's
basically the nice way of saying it

650
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,430
falls over one

651
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,500
companies a walkie-talkie on

652
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,170
but that sink in walking off so the user
walkie-talkie and

653
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,760
p.m. nuclear power issues left and right
a

654
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,820
can be good for us I'm and I say first
incident because or more

655
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,400
second was it's a Korean Tennessee
mayhem 79

656
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,030
high-techs walkie-talkie send a signal
on

657
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,119
8 Spurrier signal to all four channels
for pressure riser

658
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,619
shading safety injection and and that's
their words for

659
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:10,990
ship to Matt happened I'm pressurize urs
component to pressurize water

660
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,339
for the reactor the we think about

661
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:18,580
reactors know how to get stuff that
cools 'em we need that

662
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,930
a third incident Three Mile Island 82

663
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,930
basically there a walkie talkies told
their own safety gear that

664
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,049
you can't breed this areas too bad for
you

665
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,770
sorry at eight min probably running out
of the room screaming

666
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:38,190
I fourth incident at Green Dolphin
mississippi July 83

667
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,470
on we lost a shutdown called her shut
down causing a cooling loop

668
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,339
I'm to up in you don't fall over for 30
minutes

669
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:49,920
again cooling loop so is it more scary
did

670
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,430
walkie-talkie cause this or it took
eight years before the NRC to say

671
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,080
a restive you should be aware of this on
the way more good news

672
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,710
on there was rediscovered it David best
for Davis best

673
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,380
and not 2011 just a few years ago I
emergency water cooling system

674
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,839
lost for two minutes says given its
presentation I'm

675
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,020
filed follow request to the NRC

676
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,630
and I'm accorded them I'm gonna get my
reports

677
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,670
that means I actually get to find out
all the hardware that was vulnerable and

678
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,510
that's kinda cool because it's all
probably still being used

679
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,500
on so if anyone wants to shut down a
nuclear power plant please don't

680
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,550
to now work in nineteen nineties time
this is really the rise the

681
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,540
vulnerabilities you could

682
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,619
as you can see everything we've covered
up until now least that little

683
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:39,550
spike on we saw comprehensible really
databases pop-up

684
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:45,680
I the nineties had 2,369 document bones
and in reality there's thousands more

685
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,509
just have to dig into one this is also
why I don't think perhaps work for the

686
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,390
presentation cuz that's pretty boring

687
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,020
hey look at that num like who display
colors in you know but that doesn't work

688
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,380
I start playing tic tac toe and I start
to lose focus

689
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:03,060
on via clio understand why I'm telling
stories for this one

690
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,650
up to 94 he saw primarily unix-based
bones local and remote

691
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:11,180
on encryption algorithms like GDS sniff
through copper redox low-key lose for

692
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,350
bassam attic yet yet crypto people weird

693
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,060
calm but they have cool names for their
stuff com they were falling like Linus

694
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,630
I am 1994 hits pandora's box opens

695
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,490
wise 1994 significant to us

696
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,569
good now the way up

697
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:35,180
basically you know the Internet becomes
the internet we knew it was the Internet

698
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,669
but everyone else starts to think a
physical on

699
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,819
so commercialization the internet birth
to the World Wide Web roughly

700
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:45,890
I it's arguable i kno and a lot more
rapid deployment applications

701
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,029
which saw an eternal found love with
baseball abilities

702
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,130
on over next 15 years bowler ability
counts would skyrocket

703
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,420
on by the way that's the first web
server ever I love the long note on that

704
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,520
don't shut me down

705
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,759
now I'm so the turn of the century saw
frequently changing landscape

706
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,300
on new technology came out on new
vulnerability classes were identified

707
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,750
but not really many upon

708
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,730
by this point we knew all about not all
but most on

709
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,010
there was a big ship the large databases
Big Data whatever you wanna call it

710
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,839
everything was going to the web I well
accessible I am

711
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:22,450
no vulnerability research Richard
greatly that we can agree on

712
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,850
on but we saw said East a steady stream
of crap

713
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:31,549
the 2006 especially we saw a huge spike
in cross site scripting SQL injections

714
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,359
on these were basically evil kitty it
saying on here some script acting here

715
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,430
the back tech

716
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,129
and reported and doesn't matter if you
can actually exploit it was close enough

717
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,859
on these vulnerabilities would be
disclosed without a vendor URL sometimes

718
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,299
I'm is horrible you maggots pick up a
little bit a

719
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,600
we learn that he want to be a security
researcher com

720
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,210
to this day it plagues us with all the
owner who is closed systems it seem

721
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,020
obscure

722
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,920
but reality have a bigger impact on us
on them so electronic voting

723
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,710
I consider that pretty I important back
and things 2000 8 2010 there's an

724
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,870
academic paper the basic we showed not
only are these machines wanna bowl

725
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:13,270
that one or two people with little
custom cartridge good recollection

726
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,680
I and by that I don't mean a district I
mean state

727
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,149
wide collection pretty scary stuff I was
all forms in automobiles

728
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,630
not only I being able to keep asked the
lock systems

729
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,940
we saw issues with breaking and ECU's

730
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,140
on there's also a real war the tax on
those

731
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,799
can if you want your own motorcycle go
to your local to car dealer

732
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,170
type in the four digit code to start the
bike without the key

733
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,780
the default four-digit code I am

734
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,650
we also for those were here earlier in
I'm Scott talk

735
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,980
medical this goes back to hi 85 that
their act 25 race condition and one

736
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,980
other things

737
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,339
this race condition didn't give you root
it killed someone yeah a little

738
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:59,200
details like that hi interesting
research into I CDs which

739
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,490
he probably covered I'm sorry I slept in
I'm

740
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,180
they were these I cities basically have
Bluetooth and said hey you can you know

741
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,950
interface with me for diagnostics

742
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:11,390
I but no you don't need of medication or
encryption just interface

743
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,210
thanks let me know that's bad because I
dick cheney decided disable the wireless

744
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,040
feature of his ICD

745
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,569
one year before although this was
disclosed and five years before the

746
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:21,740
homeland plot

747
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,149
I which made the news on we saw Jay
Radcliffe give

748
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,190
a good information on insulin pumps and
after going to the vendor in saying hey

749
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,100
he's a really bad I could die if someone
did bad things to it

750
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,029
the defenders like oh yeah that's pretty
serious we're not gonna fix it thanks

751
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,370
I'm so he swore off using an insulin
pump after that

752
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,549
a

753
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,150
security products who in here uses any
kind of computer security product

754
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:49,200
yeah all of us 2 percent of my database
for vulnerabilities and security

755
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:49,890
products

756
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,879
tour adding layers and layers are
vulnerabilities on top it's like a we're

757
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,540
gonna close a few an open a few

758
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,130
mileage may vary mom so ultimately

759
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,230
what are we saying everything's the same
absolutely everything

760
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,240
I we have new exciting devices sure

761
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,040
but we have the same or vulnerabilities
on me now it's even become

762
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,410
an industry into itself I with bug
bounties

763
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,420
in 2011 sharp rise about the program's

764
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,440
how the first by the way goes back to
netscape in 1995

765
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,140
they figured out early on I'm so when
you re not these articles about history

766
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,700
a bug bounties and they're like year
2006 whatever just walk away

767
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,210
on but companies an online service is
started it

768
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,480
the what used to fetch a couple hundred
maybe a thousand dollars is now catching

769
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,650
up to six figures

770
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,880
on who knows how much more the

771
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,500
to the point where the payouts are
getting bigger and bigger for example

772
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,590
Google's paid out

773
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,380
over out one point a1 million dollars to
date

774
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,530
let's go alone and as the disclosures
I'm aware of

775
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:54,020
I'm yes have exact figures in a
spreadsheet know that chasm

776
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,710
kinda out there but they also what's
interesting is Google

777
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,000
pays out not just on their own but
they've actually pay for bones in OSX

778
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,170
Open GL Windows kernel live Excel XSLT

779
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,770
live XML on the Invidia drivers FM peg

780
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,950
this kind of interesting that they're
paying for vulnerabilities and other

781
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,759
people saw for sure they can fix it

782
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,820
because they use those libraries on

783
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,550
my database at the hundred thousand mark
on catalog vulnerabilities on december

784
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,360
twenty-fifth

785
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,470
Merry Christmas back then I was last
year I were

786
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,830
you know considerably further now so

787
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,529
what lessons we learned I am all these
vulnerabilities that you see in you like

788
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:33,360
a escort

789
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,480
overbilling they're not new they're very
old very old

790
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,900
on cleartext transmissions 1902

791
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,430
crypto failure 39 I modern cocco like
mechanical

792
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,540
chart I'm trusting user input 655
overflows 83

793
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,690
SQL injection 98 cross-site scripting 99

794
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,770
on and those dates the kind of you know

795
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,980
tentative research may show that the for
older we'll see

796
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,830
on but I'm not only one saying this we
remember shell here

797
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,779
I he wrote a paper in 2002 thirty years
after his market research

798
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,320
he basically said that based on what
he's seen in his thirty years have

799
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,140
computing career he said that modern
systems they wouldn't cut it

800
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,339
as an open system in the military on

801
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,820
and does you know who were no spouse he
brought a paper

802
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,100
are a blog couple years back and he
basically said the same thing he said

803
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,259
you know this is dismal

804
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,360
how we're not going anywhere and then we
have to ask why

805
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,250
com quite simply cuz we're not
addressing the under one problem

806
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,410
stead were doing Pandit some Papa
band-aids and said fixing issues at the

807
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,290
root problem for the root cause

808
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:42,230
were just coming up with new exciting
ways to a profit of %uh from

809
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,470
so we have blue tea lights and colorful
buzz words a little better protect this

810
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:49,100
and we have to ask all your cloud-based
ways to deal P solution protect you from

811
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,430
the BYOD threat

812
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,120
does that actually hoping it was no of
course not

813
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,380
on so the security industry we sought to
generate solutions they treat symptoms

814
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,450
not cure the disease

815
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,620
go to conferences we preach to the choir
and yes I've given this more

816
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,140
outside if this card industry for this
reason on

817
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,470
and yes I'm guilty I preach to the choir
to sorry I am

818
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:13,720
and ultimately for like these guys we
look good

819
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,740
but we don't do much on I know guys

820
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,750
I'm real close are we spend countless
hours debating full disclosure and how

821
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,580
much time to give vendors while someone
takes 3-5 10 years to fix something

822
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,790
the page or question is how do we fix
this

823
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,400
it I'm a breaker not a builder some not
the best one to answer this

824
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,650
but we have all the smart vendors with
industry-leading

825
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:40,220
whatever they've got I'm sure man she be
fixing the problem not band-aid

826
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:45,379
a so I can of the perspective from some
food for thought in a small this reality

827
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,750
the only way this is going to get better
is that we make a personal

828
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:55,310
come one of the things I said we'll say
at some conference is the only way to

829
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,410
make it personal

830
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:59,980
is when you have your children or dead
people involved

831
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,100
and it's a grim reality and I know that
when you think about it

832
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,480
that's kind of how it works so web
cameras are a great example

833
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,030
on cameras they all have default
passwords if any

834
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:14,260
the allow anyone to view the stream by
default

835
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,350
I like anything few years back the
federal trade commission said wait a

836
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:18,819
minute

837
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,230
TRENDnet trend that makes these cameras
and

838
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:26,440
the FTC you when African Court and they
basically said look you're calling your

839
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,460
product security is not secure

840
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,140
so why did the FTC go after TRENDnet
when all the cameras do it

841
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,509
because someone wrote an article that
using TRENDnet cameras

842
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:39,100
anyone on the Internet can see my
sleeping baby in the room

843
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,860
they made a personal and the FTC said a
we don't like that

844
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,350
on so gives good perspective on how we
can change things

845
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:51,240
I also interesting is the FTC is levied
$34 million in fines and

846
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,560
consumer redress calculations now

847
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,850
I basically 34 million since 98

848
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,490
so companies are starting to pay
attention you know maybe we start

849
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,910
smacking them harder and harder to work

850
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,990
but ultimately Nash we've shown that to
the design the coach I can better the

851
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,299
phones are all the same

852
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,580
on square fancy tools SDLC de Vox
standards certifications auditing

853
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,870
kinda matters told the same I'm

854
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,700
so that's what I have quick thanks to
all these people also Chaka Khan

855
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,549
the eighty people are probably the best
I've ever been her scene at any

856
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:28,040
comments 0 really thank you guys comin
with that questions

857
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,040
and now we have three minutes worth up
