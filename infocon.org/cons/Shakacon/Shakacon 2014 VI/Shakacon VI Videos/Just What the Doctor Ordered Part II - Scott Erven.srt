1
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,990
track today just as we do have those two
are

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,860
kinda tuck in talks are gonna do right
after Scott stock so scan it up a little

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,190
bit of the extra time we have

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,570
after arm so let me just a quick
introduction to scott

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,080
under Sec med sec medic

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,310
time new a mess something up Sr I will
get it law and i really excited haven't

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,580
present the stock today

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,168
we are recording his alright no organ
good awesome okay

9
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:32,509
how we give them a big round of applause
thank you

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,210
morning like I care I hear me

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,300
yeah we're good yes

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,279
there we go

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,519
alright so I am Scott Irvine I am
founder president of SEQ medic

14
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:50,969
about those rights for an all stock
ownership many questions I get to all

15
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,420
after the talk here I as well as

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,320
I did do this research and collaborated
with the schanberg under

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,850
so he runs a med sec LinkedIn group so
if you want to

18
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,030
kinda follow what's going on a medical
device research go ahead

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,299
0 awesome to thank you so much kick

20
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,750
of while not so strong while

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,470
are at garth he runs red cycling group
on LinkedIn

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,649
ending go ahead and check out summer
stories from the media that's going on

23
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,069
some other research that we're doing

24
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:30,170
and presenting on as well as I tend to

25
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:37,170
on those Twitter handles do the same
thing so first

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,720
you know how to get into researching
medical devices why did I start to do it

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,880
house is a maniac are not really I've
been in the health care industry

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,969
and I was really focused are on
realizing

29
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,658
you know the true risk to patient safety
and quality patient care for healthcare

30
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,390
organizations as we start

31
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,539
connecting all these I you know
life-saving technologies to our network

32
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:02,920
there's a sense of

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,030
you know fulfilling a reward being in
the health care industry I think a lot

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,780
of folks that do are very passionate
about it I know I am

35
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,880
I'll and in the I S side

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,269
in general you know it's always kinda
felt like we've been able to indirectly

37
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:21,989
contribute to you know the
organization's missions organization's

38
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,500
values are on patient safety

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,790
I you know provide support to those
front and clinicians and supports that

40
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,209
but we never really been able to

41
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,200
directly support that mission or
contribute to that and I think once I

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,450
started looking into

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,690
how I could do that how I could directly
have an impact on patient safety

44
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,150
I quickly realize that it was through
security medical devices

45
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,430
i working with vendors getting those
issues resolved are

46
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,769
so that we can be quick defenders in
really you know assessing in protecting

47
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,560
where essentially these life-saving
devices and great technology into great

48
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,799
thanks are just some unintended
consequences

49
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:59,590
are because we have an embedded security
inside have engineering

50
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,109
that have taken place so what new
research a regular deal today

51
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,720
well I'm sorry and I really 90 tests
today

52
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,519
I and not evening I cover
vulnerabilities that happen in this

53
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,109
decade

54
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:19,419
but what I am gonna do is present a
picture of the threat model up some

55
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:20,750
research that we did

56
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,100
with existing vulnerabilities the newer
stuff which

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,668
is her way back in 2008 out and
misconfiguration just a stone's

58
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:32,440
that we looked at that expose I medical
devices

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,720
and allow to attack medical devices from
direct public Internet facing systems

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,709
this is also you know what to say on the
stock

61
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,750
there may be some vendor names their

62
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,840
in summer the screenshots and so are the
examples are the searchers

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,660
but please no that this is a healthcare
organization issue this

64
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,019
is the healthcare organizations miss
configuring

65
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,949
their perimeter network in their
perimeter defense that's allowing

66
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,850
this information to be leaked out this
isn't something that you can point the

67
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,299
blame on a medical device manufacturer
in this case this is a something that

68
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,829
you know a federal agency is gonna
regulator do anything about now it's not

69
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:11,350
that I've issue it's truly

70
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,090
is to bother believe in 2008 along with
a misconfiguration

71
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,918
through the disclosure process this is
what we've done

72
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,979
this is as you can see job by

73
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,650
the date that we disclose it to DHS this
was

74
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,780
is very recent so we have been working
on this project for

75
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,049
coming up on three years now overall and
we decided

76
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,259
once we finish our last phase which will
talk about a high level in a little bit

77
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:38,759
here

78
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,360
we will we wanted to

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,509
look at how could we look at direct
internet facing exposure

80
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,080
and so we started right on that right
away and that's why this is research

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,620
research but this is our disclosure
process they were thirtieth this is when

82
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,280
we found it

83
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,710
we found its very quickly and may fifth
we had a very detailed briefing

84
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,099
I am with DHS and DHS ICS erred

85
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,710
we have provided ongoing assistance the
various federal agencies the car about

86
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,960
the data getting the data

87
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,150
all the organizations that are affected
and also

88
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,349
on many healthcare organizations average
salary reached out to quite a few of

89
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,890
those

90
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,289
on and medical device manufactures hard
to get them the information at a time of

91
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,850
you know bring this information public
so what's the bad news

92
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,760
even though not going to slow 02

93
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,510
these findings still pose a very
significant risks to health care

94
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,380
organizations

95
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,780
specifically got to medical devices that
we know have all their abilities and

96
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,390
have many legacy systems inside other
networks

97
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,840
the other is a bad news here's when we
set out

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,330
to research this it actually took us

99
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,169
under an hour it was about 30 minutes a
when I located this first organization

100
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,800
that I use it as an example

101
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,190
so it's not a very sophisticated attack
it's something that anybody can do

102
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,389
and also was the show that the common
belief that's out there healthcare

103
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:07,490
organizations relieving ten maybe
fifteen year behind

104
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,500
15 years behind what you see in retail

105
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,410
or in the financial sector which they
continue to preach every day as well

106
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,930
arm and we're definitely the health care
side way behind that and you'll see

107
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,700
arm by what I show you that I go to
paint that picture

108
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,930
so what's the good news is an in all
this and what we found right it's not

109
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,820
all bad

110
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,990
um thus there is significant risk but
they can be mitigated variously were

111
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,320
gonna show you

112
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,990
so we found him in an hour an
organization can also

113
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,919
lo que intermediate this issue and close
this access point within an hour

114
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,080
and it's going to require little or no
investment from the organization

115
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,479
slipcover know before getting a new
researchers want to cover the quickly

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,380
summer previous research kinda different
devices in areas that we covered

117
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,110
are some other weaknesses that you see
at a high level inside of these devices

118
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,650
lab systems and refrigeration storage

119
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,239
this year kinda go hand in hand
primarily they both end up in the lab

120
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
but various lab systems I

121
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,888
they have week hardcoded credentials
inside of Web services along with

122
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,090
your refrigeration storage actually a
very weak

123
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,460
passwords or default passwords but
they're hard coated all the time

124
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,090
solar for duration storage site you'll
see everything from

125
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,320
just storing lab samples all the way up
to cry engine experts ours

126
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,440
well these devices have the capability
to do

127
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,740
logging and monitoring of the
temperatures inside these devices

128
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,800
they also have the capability to do
automated

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,199
alerting if it falls outside of those
upper and lower bounds

130
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,010
so that a a lab tech can go and move
those so

131
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,789
you don't have spoilage insider those a
refrigeration units

132
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,460
are inside the web services what we find
I and most these vendors

133
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,489
as you can go in with with week are
coated credentials

134
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,080
you can turn the learning of which they
are learning is either through e-mail

135
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,710
or a lot of them have actual they wear
like a wireless

136
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,810
alert pager so that if it goes off they
know right away

137
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,040
that there's something wrong with the
upper and lower but temperature limits

138
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,230
that they've set on the device

139
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,699
so you can disable the learning first

140
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,910
and then you can they're completely shut
off all these units or you can change

141
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,030
that upper and lower

142
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,348
threshold inside those devices causing
you know everything in the lab to spoil

143
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,579
so similar its or their packs MRI and CT

144
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:39,750
taxes like anything to do with religion
comments what stores anytime enjoy as an

145
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,769
MRI with a CT system

146
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,370
any other storage devices they're gonna
come into action it

147
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,370
what we see here and I think this is 10
in my opinion of one of the

148
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,860
biggest risks and why they're so much
medical identity theft going on right

149
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,550
now

150
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,859
is through the actual application they
require

151
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,240
authentication to get into so if you log
into the actual

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,110
packs application and you try to get
into to view those images are that

153
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,029
patient data

154
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:09,459
its gonna property for authentication
it's gonna require

155
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:13,329
on the back and have only found one
manufacturer that i've ever reviewed

156
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:16,839
so if you go back to on the back in in
the network at the IP

157
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,910
up this pack systems no authentication

158
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,269
full access to the entire entire
database all the image in files

159
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,399
social vigorous their mostly and you
know patient privacy ePHI not

160
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,809
necessarily you know patient safety
rests per se

161
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:35,999
MRI and CT systems I they

162
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,850
typically how those workers those are
web services as well

163
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,529
we see a lot of fun in cryptid
webservice transfers the files

164
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,930
sewer rats exits at the at the station
and he wants to put in the order that

165
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,709
position ordered to take an image that
for these devices

166
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:56,248
goes ahead he puts that in he sends a
command from a workstation

167
00:09:56,249 --> 00:10:00,420
the basically pushes it kind it's like I
S box a temp folder inside the MRI are

168
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,079
inside the CT scanner

169
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,399
it sits there it doesn't actually
execute

170
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,069
the you know the image discover failsafe
which is good

171
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:16,610
which is really good on that the rad
tech typically ass a push like a little

172
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,480
red like staples easy button type thing

173
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,420
and they push that button and it's also
can bust like direct connection

174
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,139
and you hit that button and then it goes
it retrieves well you just push down

175
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,439
from the rad tech workstation

176
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:31,959
and it runs that imagine so that has up
you know exposure time limit

177
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:37,748
it has xiii-2 quarter net up the area of
where you want to take the image

178
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:41,490
and so that failsafe is really good cuz
remotely

179
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,540
it's a pretty good security control but
you can't go and just start shooting

180
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,980
random images are things like that but
what you can do because there's on

181
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,079
encrypted web service traffic

182
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:56,699
is you can replay I'll new data and you
can change the actual damaging

183
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,550
I location for worse going to take that
image as well as the exposure time

184
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,910
frames

185
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,529
inside the XML files look at past that
box on the rad tech actually hits that

186
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:11,209
it's going to take an incorrect capture
on the patient

187
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,638
distributors is are kinda savaria style
tights ICD is

188
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,439
external defense ISIC is a new
technology that goes

189
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:22,819
underarm it doesn't go inside the chest
cavity so it's very good for

190
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:26,429
infection prevention but for security
it's just like the rest of them

191
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,139
a lot of the implantable they run over
telemetry

192
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,350
so they're gonna run on like the 400 K
ranch up

193
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,889
and the issue with the is that we
typically see Kevin through

194
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,399
I actually did some really good research
all the way back in 2008 as well

195
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,509
bombing came out with his findings and
so this typically still still want to

196
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:45,670
see to this day

197
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,550
is those implantable 09 a Russell
amateur

198
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,868
but the controller system that syncs
with those five metres systems

199
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:57,339
does our talk require any type of
authentication

200
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,290
so you can take that I and with like a
new radio set up for something like that

201
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,480
you can step that traffic you can replay

202
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,749
those attacks and you can San

203
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:11,100
to shocks a to the fam or you can

204
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,540
change a pearl or something limits to
when it actually sense is he going into

205
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,829
cardiac arrest and should start shocking
you

206
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:21,579
so you can change it say or do initiate
250 views per minute and then

207
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:25,339
but not for lebanon that you can also
said

208
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:29,309
rescue shots without an answer what that
occasionally States devices

209
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,689
so they're typically activated your age
abut you can

210
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:35,980
you can go ahead and you can replay them
they don't require any authentication

211
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,319
obviously there is clinical use that
right on

212
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,719
you would hate to miss security solution
is a bit of a difficult one

213
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,879
you would hate to you know presents and
forgot the password

214
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,119
ok that device and all the sand you know
a patient as I tables there's two sides

215
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,089
to every story

216
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,569
but obviously when you take a better
look at what we do kinda balance that

217
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:56,559
security

218
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,499
you know and and that patient safety and
quality care

219
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,529
infusion pumps same-sex things

220
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:08,420
we see unaccepted web services sometimes
in those

221
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,059
a more commonly what you see is
superfluous services

222
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,410
us would that happen absolutely no
operational use case that we can fight

223
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,790
to see things you know heart auditor
authenticated

224
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,379
tell that SSH those data services for
remote administration

225
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:27,660
if they really crafty I think that will
never find me throw on some random port

226
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,079
on you know security through obscurity
specifically where you see there

227
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,899
%uh and what you what you get into and
what's dangerous is there's being able

228
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,550
to update drug libraries

229
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,269
because that's what sets upper and lower
dose limits on those tapes devices

230
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:44,670
almost all infusion pumps her on
wireless network as well hard because

231
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,179
they want those cards to be mobile

232
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,738
policies typically see them on the
organization's

233
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:55,209
internal network summer which on the
older ones will only run what

234
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,248
medical device integration was last
known to cover its kinda something

235
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:02,509
where you typically wouldn't see devices

236
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,119
interconnected so anesthesia carts for
example

237
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:09,239
or ventilators

238
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:14,089
historically they've intentionally on at
least that someone okay we're not going

239
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:16,869
to connect those in an hour can allow
communication

240
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:20,540
well with electronic medical records in
the need for the position to really go

241
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,879
to one place

242
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,629
and see all that patient data medical
device integration has become huge

243
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,179
inside the health care industry

244
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,709
and what that allows you to do is you to
pick up a software or hardware module

245
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:36,429
to this starts the devices aggregate the
data and governance your medical record

246
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:39,649
well again the solutions that i've seen
out there

247
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:43,879
on their art too many to choose from
they have

248
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,949
uninterrupted web services and data
transfer or you can intercept that

249
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:51,719
on and you can just take her and
incompletely replay

250
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,299
by the step informational ultimately
stream down into medical record

251
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,509
the misinformation serbia like a kinda
like medical identity theft and always

252
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:00,959
someone goes into presents

253
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,589
under your identity and the show up and
possibly get misdiagnosed or

254
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:10,879
receive I incorrect description
something like that

255
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,480
so over-the-top person without I think
these are kinda recorder right

256
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,139
nothing new this is stuff again 10-15
years behind other industries

257
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:22,290
requiring doing it why are we still here
so number one is really hard corporate

258
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,040
accounts

259
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,170
that is the biggest upon our ability
inside a medical devices

260
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,179
blankets uninterrupted web applications
web services

261
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,410
different various a data interfaces

262
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,110
its purpose services again with no
operational use case

263
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,519
its like one developer decides I'm gonna
throw you know tell that on this port

264
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,480
and three other developers choose their
own little round important so then they

265
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,199
have seven portraying tell that
persevere some

266
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,238
you know back door that the that the
developer sir into the system

267
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:55,839
ultimately they're thrown out to
production

268
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,029
system up there some patching this is a
big one

269
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:03,649
we often the office here healthcare this
misconception and a lot of people still

270
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:05,230
don't understand

271
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,379
big cheer from the vendor were

272
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:11,839
the vendor tells them they can't hatch

273
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,549
the medical device or those supporting
applications and systems

274
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:19,829
the FDA has long ago and has put out
multiple guidance

275
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:23,498
that there's a site cyber security
clause for patching for updating these

276
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,059
devices it is allowed

277
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:29,389
if the vendor tells you that push back
our don't take it for face value

278
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,109
on the Arctic Circle for face value and
they said they had security when I

279
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:35,470
didn't even check it so please do a
little bit more due diligence push back

280
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,639
on the vendors a little bit

281
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:43,639
on make it known that it's a requirement
in these types of devices

282
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,040
so that was kinda the previous research
right so again why did we want to do

283
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,920
more

284
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,219
well we publish that research

285
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,920
we had folks that were still saying the
general public

286
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,899
and the physicians and even some insider
healthcare

287
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:06,699
security or what they call security but
was really compliance people

288
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:10,670
they said okay we understand these
research here these vulnerabilities are

289
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,059
there

290
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:14,790
but there's absolutely no way

291
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,980
that an attacker an adversary to get to
these devices

292
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,929
directly from the internet because we
have been behind firewall in firewall

293
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:21,740
firewall

294
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,929
and weak segmented everything which is a
complete lot

295
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:29,850
I and I know that the reality in many
healthcare

296
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,689
networks you can do segmentation to a
certain extent

297
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,700
but now with the integration this
medical device integration

298
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,929
they're pumping data and they're gonna
pump data through uninterrupted web

299
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:42,900
traffic

300
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,160
and so there have to pop bolster their
firewalls whether they wanted

301
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,690
I you know fire all the stuff of or not
the reality is

302
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,380
they can't really do anymore so they've
got to open up that internal at work

303
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,809
that's why the reasons we want to do it
this is actually the FBI got involved

304
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,950
the talk about that a little bit more
here later

305
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,000
on why the FBI got involved historically
we haven't seen advisories from the FBI

306
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,380
we've seen from DHS ice yes sir

307
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,330
and from the FDA a broad I just a few
months ago

308
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,510
the FBI actually released two separate
that month

309
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,120
I'll private industry notices as are
called the got

310
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,789
healthcare organizations doing
specifically with security issues in

311
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,840
medical devices

312
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,340
and you know malware type activity on
those devices as well

313
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,129
but this is our biggest things in goes
this misconception already here to carry

314
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,130
it

315
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,049
to the biggest more ability was a
perception it. healthcare professionals

316
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,129
believes

317
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,940
that their current renter defense is in
compliance strategies or working

318
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,039
when clearly the data states otherwise
that was specifically

319
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,340
verbatim byword in the FBI adviser

320
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,100
and it's clearly what I see all the time
are spokes tell me till they're blue in

321
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,809
the face

322
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,928
all there's no way you can get at these
devices

323
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:58,549
so we want to really you know inform
them on and present them with the

324
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,750
research to show them that there truly
is that risk they're not really hiding

325
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,429
out behind the fire all in all cases

326
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:09,690
so threat model discover this really
quickly I'll pray for really receive the

327
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,899
CW you maybe not so much

328
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,518
iight apec but I reference some reason
my slides

329
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,019
just so that you can understand and
threat model that back to you

330
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:24,260
okay is unknown vulnerabilities are nor
known classes attacks or miss

331
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,639
configurations that have existed for a
long time

332
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:31,370
arm and we're just putting lots for
peace the information together show the

333
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,610
true rescue

334
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,620
sorry shorthand for this research or
John out early and rebrand some

335
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,399
a custom searches things like that on on
various devices but this one

336
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:47,379
we happen to be actually working on

337
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,669
a talk they were gonna present on Def
Con and so I was searching if you were

338
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:52,570
called anesthesia

339
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,019
and quickly a system came up and I said
oh what the heck this isn't it

340
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:58,450
anesthesia device right

341
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,510
what's going on and so I I took a look
at the system but I quickly realized

342
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:02,970
that

343
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,440
0 it actually has SMB over

344
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,710
externally and passing through the
firewall

345
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,950
and it's actually giving me a name on
anesthesia cart

346
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,990
inside the network and on top of it

347
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,789
it happens to me an older version of
Windows XP

348
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,460
what's the initial health care
organization this car is wrongly filed

349
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,039
within 30 minutes and we spent a day or
two

350
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,330
actually doing some further research to
see if it was a global issue now to get

351
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,039
into

352
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,950
for South Korea's Asiana came across
head over 12,000 employees

353
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,720
3,000 positions very large
cardiovascular neuroscience institutions

354
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,580
which you'll see when we get into the
actual %uh screenshots the details and

355
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,158
all systems

356
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,070
expose intelligence on over 68,000
systems

357
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,590
provide direct attack records every one
of those devices

358
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,879
it also exposed numerous third-party
organizations and other healthcare

359
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,539
systems

360
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:03,149
so for example I'll you know lab
services are specialty services

361
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:06,029
something like that Health Organization
may subcontract

362
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:09,429
that to another large healthcare
organization a specialized that in that

363
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,519
area so we seen those types of

364
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,519
systems clearly identified with no and

365
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:21,220
no third-party healthcare organizations
inside the 68,000 systems

366
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,330
to refine only one organization no we
found hundreds

367
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,689
a so after we did the shot and I really

368
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,620
we reported this initially the DHS's hey
there's this one you know huge health

369
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,389
care organization that we just found it

370
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:37,320
will be back in a couple days let you
know it's a global issue or not we don't

371
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,178
know

372
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,370
well yeah it is we found hundreds arm

373
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,229
these are the search is that we do in
showdown were typically all we're doing

374
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,779
if you know how to run showed a

375
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,649
now is we're running SMB port and we're
running different or values here

376
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:53,668
of four health for clinic for hospital
for medical

377
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:56,429
for different keywords that would
trigger on board name that was

378
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:57,570
associated with those

379
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,870
and so does the number hits over there
on the right

380
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,049
up you can see that adds up fairly
quickly when you change that search term

381
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:08,529
are you starting in specially clinic so
if you change the search term like

382
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:09,330
cardiology

383
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,809
or urology for podiatry pediatric can
try to get in the summer those

384
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,320
you're gonna start finding you know and
upwards of thousands

385
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,710
up these types of health large
healthcare organizations that have these

386
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,179
this intelligence leaking out their
external system

387
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,240
so who cares about us to me okay I would
know about as a musician B miss

388
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,309
configure a right

389
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,480
is it that big a deal well like I said
it does have to be an XP system

390
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,980
and it was vulnerable I to an ISO 80 67

391
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,940
of you're not familiar with that on that
was the vulnerability to configure years

392
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:50,139
but at its core it's really a forum
Ochoa execution vulnerability

393
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:54,168
so still you know why does that matter
well it's a gold mine for the attackers

394
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,250
it leak specific information identified
in medical devices

395
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,809
and are supporting technology systems
and applications

396
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:04,070
the common misconception up all you
gotta get directly into a medical device

397
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,418
to cause you know patient safety your
heart

398
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,740
that's not the case many of these
medical devices

399
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,440
receive you know manaus Russian sets
through an application

400
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,029
from just a regular workstation and
through the application interface with

401
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,159
medical device itself

402
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,639
you don't necessarily have to get
directly to that medical device about to

403
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:24,928
carry out you know attack her adversary

404
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:28,630
at least the hostnames up all the
systems on a network

405
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,620
and oftentimes I as of their showing you
hear the examples are coming up next it

406
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,668
a week for

407
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:38,330
Italy sleek specifically I I don't like
Active Directory what operating room

408
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,850
suite that device or a CT scan or
whatever it is and

409
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,949
delete the position and it'll also tell
us

410
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,470
in many cases if there's a system
timeout exception if there's no lock out

411
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,350
a place or what

412
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,320
timeout after 15 minutes

413
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,720
rx was good to some screenshots your
what is the impact

414
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,529
personal over on the left ear this is
the lockout exemption EBC over on the

415
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:01,549
far right

416
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:05,980
that's a the screen lock exemption set
to zero that means it's never gonna lock

417
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,610
up

418
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,969
so may not require login we know we
could go in and look at that you can see

419
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,730
operating room on operating sys

420
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,519
are operating room to where they're
located over on the right

421
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,460
and again this is an offender issue is
what happens to show a pic with this

422
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,669
large healthcare organization was not an
epic issue but this goes the paint the

423
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,429
picture

424
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,570
that this is our servers they're running
their electronic medical record

425
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,620
the stop on up there are you getting the
clarity in business topics

426
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,629
that's what doing data interfaces and
reporting what their medical record you

427
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:33,918
get down to the bottom here

428
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,990
where it says my chart that's the actual
application that you use

429
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,179
to go to the web to access your medical
record and interact with that position

430
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,019
that's your part 0 your medical record
that you have access to so we know

431
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:49,289
Arroyo systems I'll and what
specifically they're running inside 0

432
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,919
%uh in south america records

433
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,240
alright afghanis more interesting stuff
because some packs imaging systems

434
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,950
a again that's up top you see there's an
MRI boxers the city's system

435
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,159
on in the ED the bottom

436
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,360
thats to lemon tree so we don't know
I'll just buy to let you like what that

437
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,229
would be right

438
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,419
yes pacemakers run telemetry but it's
not like a telemetry

439
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:16,899
network it's just a Near Field
Communication

440
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:21,168
telemetry that those right on so we know
it's not that whatever systems run

441
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:22,070
slattery well

442
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,539
in production system select a little
based bracelet branding

443
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:29,980
I are banding take thing that you I you
see at the hospital that if

444
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,990
you know there's nuffin induction
that'll actually go up because you you

445
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,690
know you got too far away from the mom

446
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,929
or you in our door not locked down the
other doors

447
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:41,769
adult laundering type situations they're
using the systems that are using

448
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:44,049
telemetry

449
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:47,149
to cardiology sisters all right now
you're asking right now again the

450
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:48,508
pacemaker boxes

451
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:52,600
on some love them their capped out here
but saw them specifically or label

452
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,039
pacemaker controllers

453
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:58,350
car so they're pretty good idea what the
systems do place where controllers we

454
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:58,719
know

455
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,909
don't require anything about an occasion
we know specifically what that the by

456
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:04,509
six

457
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:08,269
no one there's new bed of Pediatrics
unit first floor

458
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:12,960
again it's very specific car information
to an adversary attacker

459
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,139
a on whatever systems are there the
bottom on those are anesthesia is

460
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:21,279
inside at all are

461
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,500
so again to be fine just few devices no

462
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,529
so we can only find one hospital we felt
actually thousands

463
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,440
I'll but then again we found thousands
in medical devices just inside on that

464
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,190
one

465
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,970
healthcare organizations have stepped on
a global issue are

466
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,330
what we did here is we dump this raw
data

467
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:44,860
wish track today into our favorite

468
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,899
data modeling to a college cell

469
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,449
and that's how you identified the unique
60,000 systems

470
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,799
but then we also on how we did it is
very very quickly just decided to scrap

471
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,889
all that and you

472
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:02,439
again do search terms for you know
critical areas like cardiology things

473
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,049
like that

474
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:06,320
so here's a thought

475
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,649
since these are related systems we found

476
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:14,600
21 systems on that were associated with
an assist systems

477
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,309
as I said before this had a very large I

478
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,918
cardiology institution attached to it
there's 488

479
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,179
assistant so sue cardiology that we
found

480
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:28,730
information was leaked with all their
specific host names

481
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,549
at all that data infusion an MRI

482
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:36,889
133 infusion systems on 97

483
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:41,860
MRI systems when we searched through
this one organization's data

484
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,990
pack system that goes back to damaging
again that's

485
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,539
all the image archiving again I think
this suits

486
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,629
group you know my opinion i think is a
very high likelihood that this attack

487
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,559
vector

488
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,750
is actually years about to go after
these devices that we know how passwords

489
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,179
on the on the back and storage

490
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:01,570
to really get that medical identity
identity theft because there's money to

491
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,470
be made

492
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,399
nuclear med systems we happen to find 67
again

493
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:13,350
it a big new med specialty associated
with it a lot of the Cardiology

494
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,269
the lastly pacemaker associates asleep
on 31 insider those

495
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:23,460
that showed us those texts devices were
associated to this organization

496
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,330
Swiss talk about some potential attacks
right we'll start with the

497
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,259
the weakest one first I'll if Eric Smith
was here

498
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:35,429
and he wasn't hungover here tell you get
all excited about this on to say this is

499
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:36,440
the best one ever

500
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,450
right mister social engineer up but this
really goes the paint the picture

501
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,499
and I can tell you would be very
valuable talk to someone

502
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:48,090
you know trying to do that type of
attack because

503
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,139
you're not too early to say how physical
attack you now know

504
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:56,459
the systems that you want to go after
after you get access that network

505
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,470
you know location in many times for the
specific office to oversee

506
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,230
you can walk into that location you can
go to for tuning good office number 112

507
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,389
a note that system has a lock on
exception you're probably gonna be a

508
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:08,449
locker and get on the network

509
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,850
and specifically go after those those
host names that we were identified

510
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,809
through the SNB intelligence Lee

511
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:18,289
saw the phishing attack right to Ralph
Lauren those

512
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,460
but a very common

513
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,090
exact same issue we have all the
information we need

514
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:29,149
on adversary all attacker needs to do
now is send you that phishing email

515
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:33,498
with the Customize paleo about to go
ahead and target the specific host names

516
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:37,090
so that no longer head against your
internal network

517
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,709
completely a scan on tarnower can be all
my see

518
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,809
and raise alarms get a foothold in an
hour

519
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:48,049
and %uh specifically after hostnames the
target that medical devices are this the

520
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:52,570
you know locations that they want to
take a look at

521
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,850
can attack this the one that's directly
accessible from the internet

522
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,748
because they're vulnerable to Ms 0806
other is you can pop up box

523
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:04,850
the computer from that box and again
because you know the back and networks

524
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,998
in its policy

525
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:09,809
are you can read a custom payload after
you have it directly go after those

526
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:10,620
devices

527
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,580
it's gonna be very stealthy for
attackers their point not gonna raise a

528
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,720
lot of alarms

529
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,559
started the sack this is an interesting
on this or even start

530
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,460
to paint the picture start to understand
is a targeted attack

531
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:30,299
you know really a possibility really a
risk well I showed you

532
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,980
everyone other electronic medical record
systems I showed you

533
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,480
okay we've had this box and give it to
them probably go in the sector

534
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,990
after you do that the missing you know
why the missing pieces there is to find

535
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,360
out

536
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,939
when a certain patients going to be a
certain area such as medical record

537
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,820
systems okay I could go after these

538
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,029
I can go out for their you know Oracle
databases or

539
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:55,559
wherever they happen to be using MS
equal finally pass from other systems

540
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,820
and all access their medical record
devices without scanning entire network

541
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,168
I guess your patients are gonna show up
or what doctor that patients gonna visit

542
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:04,059
and I know

543
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:07,379
where that doctors office is located
what systems associated that position to

544
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,908
reap intelligence

545
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:13,379
so then you know you start building the
case oh okay you can you know launch a

546
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:14,299
targeted attack

547
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,320
at a specific location specific rooms

548
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,090
are in conjunction with that he got into
the medical records his own you would

549
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,299
kinda be able to

550
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,850
on bring those things together and make
the case for that that's not that

551
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,570
far-fetched

552
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,360
so who held on to do this right so so an
adversary misconceptions

553
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,408
that I got out of the previous research
that we did

554
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:40,799
the first one I was obviously well their
only

555
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,940
they only care about the financial gain
so there's no anybody's going to attack

556
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,649
us right

557
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:48,629
and yes the russians are in there every
day taking our information and selling

558
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:51,269
it that's what they do

559
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:55,629
the second one I had kid you not

560
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:58,840
this guy email me and commented I'll

561
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,350
on the initial Wired article that we
were giving

562
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,199
information to the show elapse in caves

563
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,879
and they didn't have the intelligence to
figure it out

564
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:14,149
so that's just the show the ignorance of
the comments the feedback that idea and

565
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:17,549
some other misconceptions on the
adversaries right

566
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:21,350
is that they actually believe that they
are competent enough and that every

567
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,879
single extremists or terrorists happen
for the nikkei

568
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:28,009
pay little blew my mind home but some
people

569
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:31,360
I just a pretty persistent and their
ways

570
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,758
and again just the bottom point you know

571
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,720
saying that it's they're not technically
adept to carry out point you don't

572
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,779
necessarily have to be

573
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:45,369
decision show dennis is a open source
work on census available to the public

574
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:48,289
to miss configuration that we know
shouldn't be in place and it's a

575
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:51,440
vulnerability this been publicly
disclosed since 2008

576
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,279
and it's not just any vulnerability this
the one to configure and also is one of

577
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:55,820
the most

578
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,720
highlighted vulnerability is there a
published so it doesn't take much

579
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,330
technical skill in order to

580
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,249
you know execute you know this type of
information

581
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:11,129
so should we worry about it where is the
rest for the target to a medical device

582
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:14,289
buying you know terrorists extremists
are obviously a case

583
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:18,490
%uh that can be made especially when you
get into you know technically adaptive

584
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:18,909
another's

585
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,869
is an advanced skill set you still have
to be able to locate a vulnerability

586
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:25,090
inside a medical device once you get in
there

587
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:29,299
so you know groups like I sis or nations
state-sponsored actors

588
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,789
those takes a adversary test our group

589
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:37,269
a are probably the greatest risk the
highest likelihood

590
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:42,059
up something happening

591
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:46,049
source adversary attack model you know
really look like right

592
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:50,879
what's our greatest risk probably a
combined attack it doesn't need to be a

593
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:54,019
health care

594
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,909
probably looking at me that way you know
Boston Marathon on air 911 something

595
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:59,899
like that in conjunction

596
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:03,149
with an attack on health care systems
and say a 10-mile radius

597
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:08,029
or you know power good things like that

598
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,350
and why this man you know a conspiracy
gang coming up and saying of mine attack

599
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,440
is really a risk I

600
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,710
parts it's not just me I mean US
government is

601
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,250
is funding the stuff heavily for the
last two years

602
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,110
sever City I ask you this I encounter
accents in agreement

603
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,310
there's a link there I'll for a
Washington Post article that basically

604
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,710
server city was funded

605
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,980
about to give DOD and federal
information security folks

606
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,110
access to a real-life scenario based
training

607
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,560
of combined attacks so they put together
and they built the cyber city that has

608
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,139
olive you critical infrastructure in one
place as lights all hooked up to it so

609
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,139
is getting attacked

610
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,639
large start going up to really put the
fenders and how to respond

611
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,250
with a combined attack and I think this
also goes to the point I love

612
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,140
back to you why did the FBI of the FBI
historically

613
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,850
never put out an adviser on medical
device is a medical device secured

614
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,810
only the FDA ths I see a cert for
tomorrow

615
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,590
I truly think that this is the reason
the FBI guy

616
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:17,720
they have no other really player in the
game

617
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,230
just wanna misconceptions about you know
what we found rate is doesn't have a

618
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,020
protect us

619
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,370
it must be an effective which I'm not
regarding the effectiveness

620
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,029
but really hit the focus is on pace pay
privacy a patient data

621
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,150
it doesn't focus on medical device
security

622
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,770
it doesn't focus are on ever say
resilience you know testing & mitigation

623
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,880
take threats of

624
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,480
healthcare organizations a especially
you know obviously in the US

625
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,610
they've been given funding for the last
ten years and they bring in funding

626
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:52,770
to build their so called information
security programs due to

627
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,560
couple meeting those requirements
reading those in our checking of those

628
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,310
boxes

629
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,310
a lot little checklist

630
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,680
so what that's forced is really building

631
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,720
compliance and information assurance for
privacy a patient data

632
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,240
it has been focused on securing you know
medical devices are looking at patient

633
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,479
safety issues

634
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,530
so many other three letter you know
federal agencies really protect you know

635
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,750
healthcare Meyer

636
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,130
not really on the FDA doesn't

637
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,190
are required security testing
validations purvis

638
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,890
510 K process right now I'll some people
think that they should

639
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:37,950
I don't know that it's the best place
for I'll argue that today

640
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,330
and they've told you specifically and
advisers they came out when a

641
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,850
when Billy ocean Terry McCorkle off on
the 300 last year

642
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,290
and the advisories came out I want to
miss this ICS alert

643
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,360
by the FBI tens actually from April but
they told health organizations I told

644
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,770
medical device manufacturers

645
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,240
it's your responsibility recommend that
you start doing step adversarial

646
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,790
resilience protesting against your
network

647
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,220
not focusing so much on you know
compliance information assurance that

648
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,009
you need to get the resources they need
to get

649
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,910
dedicate people to really looking at
these devices

650
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,190
to solutions and recommendations for
healthcare organizations are always very

651
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,900
big on this

652
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,130
have are presenting research is really
do a quick defenders and

653
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,820
you know not only bring awareness but
bring your solutions

654
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,120
us that you can quickly your immediate
this risk or media strategy so

655
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,540
first thing is going to be like to start
alright and Hartnell

656
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,759
partner shell hard your tax surface how
do you do that

657
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,770
there's kinda too quick ways the first
one is

658
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,990
get yours order of shoulder so very
simple

659
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,520
it's going to take our last the test
this so you know the exact same crew is

660
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,110
that Iran

661
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,660
start looking for SMB services but I
wouldn't do that

662
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,690
I was searching for churches with your
name and I will start looking

663
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,840
specifically at your IP address space

664
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,110
and look at all a bit and see if there's
a surplus services

665
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,300
our entire attack vectors that can take
place

666
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,740
site gonna cost hardly anything you may
have to pay the eighteen dollars order

667
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,430
the upgrade account to actually get
access to the workers

668
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,210
and you know you say I maker sharp
reminisce wait for it doesn't have to be

669
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:10,900
a mess but

670
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,210
com can be any other tools you need to
use immunity

671
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,750
NewsCore whatever you want but yeah
actually have to do this that the

672
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,710
testing

673
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,480
what else well stop bleeding first
that's most important thing that I

674
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,050
showed and look at this if your health
care organization

675
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,230
do that or church that some research
make sure you get their services stops

676
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,140
that they don't continue to leak out
that intelligence hollow's internal

677
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,730
systems

678
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:39,250
or that you notice that you have a
public-facing boxes vulnerable

679
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,250
to Ms 0806 other

680
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,600
and really read something right that's
going to take over a little bit longer

681
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,819
the Sun immediate solution to address
this but we really need to start red

682
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,690
tuning in sight healthcare organizations

683
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,830
and looking at those risks

684
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,390
so what do we need see you know from the
research community where we need for

685
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,940
medical device researchers we need a few
things

686
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,020
by this first on I'm just as guilty as
the rest of us

687
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,810
oftentimes arm when it's not associated
to

688
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,500
you know academic University type
research

689
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,730
and it's just independent research that
we're doing you know

690
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,850
for father has are passionate about we
have a very

691
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,009
very poor job will you know documenting
so is repeatable

692
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:24,270
of for others to look at really
understand so please start to do that

693
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:28,790
gonna get into med device a space it's
not as difficult as it sounds actually

694
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,430
this

695
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:33,609
common misconception that there's this
huge burden should start researching

696
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,910
medical devices

697
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,770
you know I've been fortunate to you know
have access there's a lot of vices and

698
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,460
be able to

699
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,580
you can buy them I he did so I go on
e-bay

700
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,700
by all these devices are tied

701
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,330
a you keep obvious they're going to
build a four-city system more fair CT

702
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,410
scanner or have

703
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,890
our room in your spare better for one
but a lot was the racial abuse and pump

704
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,370
things like that are very inexpensive
cup water bottle ass

705
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,540
but you don't even need access those
devices in many cases you can go out

706
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,540
start doing Google searches start
grabbing publicly available vendor

707
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,860
documentation

708
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,930
and oftentimes what we found in our
research is it will actually tell you

709
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:15,660
in the installation guide that there's a
hardcore password when you have to say

710
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,660
like this that's what it is for to see
those things

711
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,359
more often than not dawning don't need
access the vices start looking at this

712
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,450
our space but one thing we need to focus
on on

713
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,720
further research is that are doing the
work is really his digital hell space

714
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,480
traditional health is at all this
wearable technology it

715
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,110
you know scales that are that are hooked
and it's kinda like this collision

716
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,150
past six collision of death rate its I O
T

717
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,190
like combining with medical devices and
it scares the hell outta me

718
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,140
are and I'm really after this going to
focus

719
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,650
strategically only on that because I
want to make sure you bring awareness to

720
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,990
those issues

721
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,089
I'll there soon you know there's iPhone
cases that you can buy now is great

722
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,230
technology

723
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,690
is the slap the case on about your
iPhone poet

724
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,730
Stern Hu Jia send it up to send it off
to a doctor right

725
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,920
there's the fusion home out

726
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,620
that i've seen come through the other
day where it was

727
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:20,140
a.m. implantable there and wireless

728
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,330
and it was for the confusion pop I

729
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,069
for to for diabetics and so

730
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,980
you had this implantable this wireless
technology that satin like acting kinda

731
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,800
like an artificial pancreas

732
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,370
to recall to your dosage right monitor
every five minutes

733
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:40,529
what it says is that it calls back
wirelessly to your iPhone app

734
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,650
checks here and tell your iPhone app the
levels

735
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,160
and your blood sugar room recalculated
inside and out

736
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,350
and pushes out a new configuration back
to the device this penchant for

737
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,950
to that type of stuff was just not all
right with me and I'm sure

738
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,640
you know folks that are diabetic or you
know even individual AJ ratcliff

739
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,870
is that like a selfish research is done
it slip ups

740
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:08,920
and now he obviously has gone back to
you know manual injections lick

741
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,360
many others in the security research
community

742
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,620
failures ross we disclose we definitely
don't want

743
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:19,120
all I personally know on anyway
researched can have adverse affect

744
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,279
I really want to quit the defenders
really want to focus on patient safety

745
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:22,900
and

746
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,770
getting the research I'll on so that you
can be a level playing field

747
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:31,509
the attackers that are constantly you
know knocking at our door

748
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,110
and provide solutions recommendations I
C there's

749
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,470
significant amount in dollars in the
security research community

750
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,279
and we do all these awesome talks all
these awesome vulnerabilities

751
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,580
and then we never paint the picture but
the true risk is

752
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,910
and we never for a ride appropriate
solutions and recommendations inside the

753
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,870
specs on a medical device based on it
saying and other spaces we don't do a

754
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,839
good job

755
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,840
you know solutions are recommendations
but please focus on that medical the

756
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,570
wayside

757
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,100
they're willing to listen but they need
to understand I can understand the

758
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,990
complete technical details on what you
bout she got to be able to paint that

759
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,549
picture

760
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,720
of your working on this they were
stopping anytime assistance

761
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,540
our guidance you don't feel free to
email me up when you know about the end

762
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,660
here

763
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,759
arm health care industry

764
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,080
does the last flight here what we need
from them well

765
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,190
the biggest thing is we have to get away
from only focusing

766
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,850
on privacy and patient data right

767
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:31,779
we have to get away from compliance for
information assurance

768
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,330
just to get away with it or get away
from it that's not that's thats I get

769
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,350
analogy but we need to focus

770
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,880
more heavily on the actual security ever
share a resistance testing

771
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,060
red teaming things like that I really
look at it from an attacker standpoint

772
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,440
and how do we define our network from
that

773
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,020
patient data is much more replaceable

774
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:59,280
than human life right also we'll need to
start focusing on it whether there's

775
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,890
regulation in place or not

776
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:07,890
up it's morally the right thing to do is
anyone in here and health care

777
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,609
ya can we talk to your healthcare
awesome feeling here

778
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,700
I think every healthcare organization
nom

779
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,730
unless you mean you might not want to
work for them but pretty much every

780
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,480
healthcare innovation in their mission
in their core values gonna have

781
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,620
something to do with patient safety

782
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,569
to high that back you know tie that back
to that organizational goals patient

783
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,540
safety

784
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,270
it really shows that executive team that
you do have an impact

785
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,820
on that you're directly affecting that
so that's what we need to see

786
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,100
and then finally we really need to get
around this comfort of how do we

787
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,279
disclose

788
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,400
you know findings responsibly still be
able to get them publicly disclosed in

789
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,950
the end

790
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,140
to that there some sort of tracking and
historical value

791
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,810
on that we can go back to later right
now you've got you know my database and

792
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,120
you can't get recall notices that are
very back from the FDA

793
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,259
every month but there's not you know you
skip few here that we can't receive the

794
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,040
up there's not a whole lot a comforter
how to handle that so we're really

795
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,810
working

796
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,690
you know how do we handle that from all
aspects to disclose it responsibly but

797
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,200
also get publicly known

798
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,100
to the issues get fixed that we have
historical value to go back and look at

799
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,350
those

800
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:19,540
so that I have are gathers my twitter
