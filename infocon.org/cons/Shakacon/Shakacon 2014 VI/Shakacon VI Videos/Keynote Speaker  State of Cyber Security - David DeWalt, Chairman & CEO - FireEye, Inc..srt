I made them where on that stops the
conference stuff you can grab anybody

Bank today from often alright

doing a presentation I get a chance to
speak all over the world sometimes

up rarely do I get to do it right
outside Waikiki the beach

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,180

63
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,000
for that I'm I was gonna go on when I
was age a to root my first program

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,750
and we missed out the bile anyways hey
I'm

65
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,659
I'm gonna try to talk on a serious note
today about kinda what's happening in

66
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,239
the world

67
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,730
I know a lot of newer are very seasoned
security professionals

68
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,290
i've a technical background and Pinot
really I

69
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,459
interested in technology since I was a
little kid

70
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,639
and it's amazing kinda what we're
dealing with the world today

71
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,780
just absolutely amazing and up a little
on a spinal

72
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,790
but I have appear to the dawning of
cyber worse up what time I really seen

73
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,798
an incredible amount

74
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,549
evidence to suggest that we we really
are on the precipice

75
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,220
from pretty dangerous times in the world
on

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,010
if you link back about what's happened
over over mankind's history

77
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,260
whenever a new domain it's discovered
typically mankind has a conflict over

78
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,510
now whether it was the lambs our oceans
or airspace or

79
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,090
or now cyberspace we end up finding
ourselves

80
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,359
really with conflict and kinda where
we're at right now

81
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,380
when I when I first got involved with
some other

82
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,409
the global superpower conflict that are
happening I was the CEO

83
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,520
McAfee man dont 2008

84
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,060
we had a a pretty famous operation
called Aurora

85
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,669
anybody remember or pretty interesting
attack

86
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:01,430
we were involved with that McAfee in
alternately discovered

87
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,740
that Google had been hacked and we gone
and seen some of the evidence of how the

88
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,620
J pics were loaded down the spear
phishing occurred

89
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,830
who they were targeting how they were
going after the system's

90
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,880
and over the course of about thirty day
period

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,940
we ended up finding a 153 companies with
a very similar attack

92
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,060
all in Silicon Valley all focused on
source code

93
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,979
about databases kinda quality assurance
systems

94
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:29,990
and we realized for the first time how

95
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,760
long the attacks have been in place what
the research was going after

96
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,889
and just you know how powerful the
system openly was

97
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,370
I found myself opting invited to the
white house

98
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,630
about 30 minutes later and up

99
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,360
President Obama had just gotten office
beginning in 2009

100
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,200
and my job was to brief the president on
what happened with operation Aurora

101
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,479
so here I am presenting know what
malware is an appt czar

102
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,219
to the president that states I eiffel
early was like in a pinch me it was

103
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:02,029
pretty amazing

104
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,190
time but you know fast for six years
later

105
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,969
and were given briefings premieres in
presidents all over the world

106
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,260
on what's happening in fiber and I we've
just

107
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,659
elevated from 12 Kong level to another
and

108
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:20,180
with now arrived at indictments up major
military officers in China

109
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,349
what you've probably seen it it's a
pretty serious situation

110
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,380
we're all and somewhat kinda pink this
for you

111
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,479
and give you a little insight what I see
around the world

112
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,760
I have a pretty interesting view to
what's happening

113
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,310
now travels are not only with choir I
but also at the National Security

114
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,050
Council

115
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,200
also my views from safety and security
of Delta Air Lines

116
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,610
and to sort of how physical and cyber
terrorism and security are coming

117
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,150
together

118
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,409
and tell you a little bit about what the
offense is doing

119
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,669
how are powerful that often serve model
it's become

120
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,919
are in many ways how weak the defense
%uh models become help this located at

121
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:57,520
spahn

122
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,150
and then ultimately a little kinda where
it all going so I like to start off with

123
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,878
an analogy

124
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,240
many view out probably know this analogy
pretty well I love history

125
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,360
hopefully someone you do too and I think
history is repeating itself

126
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
literally right now in cyberspace and
the analogy that I like to use comes

127
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,500
from mom

128
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,800
post-world War one I it's called the
match in Oman

129
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,120
and many vino what occurred on

130
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,410
if you don't 1929 the up

131
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,490
French had proposed Andre imagino

132
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,819
who was the world Minister France are
proposed for the French parliament

133
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,629
nine billion French franc about the
fence asleep

134
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,770
at the time nine billion french francs
was

135
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,060
nearly the economy for that year and

136
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,120
this was a serious undertaking I
probably knows the greatest defense

137
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,740
system

138
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,280
that's on the world has ever seen I was
about to be built

139
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,020
this was a series of forts that were
sensually put in place

140
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,599
every three quarters of a mile and out
there for 25 it was an incredible

141
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,940
architecture that was created

142
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,319
this thing was never been seen before
every learning a world where one

143
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,770
was essentially put in place with this
the front system

144
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,650
how to overcome gas attacks how to have
ground forces be put in place for years

145
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,989
at Marshall attacks if you look at sort
of the architectures that are put in

146
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,159
place or if you can see at the back

147
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,280
but it was incredible now literally air
pressure gas chambers

148
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,218
all kinds have long sustaining you know
up to a decade-long

149
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,760
sustaining operations are complete
hangers built into the

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,159
the bay's tank commands will tunnels
coming in telecommunication systems

151
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,560
gymnasiums medical systems

152
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,000
now this thing what's up a work of art
and probably what's most amazing about

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,600
it

154
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,709
was never use most if you probably know
this

155
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:57,780
I the up ultimate the fence when all the
way from the English Channel

156
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,430
all the way down to the Mediterranean
Sea literally every three quarters of a

157
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,170
mile

158
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,880
pretty impressive %uh system others
actually to open that was built the

159
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,579
National and the Alpine line

160
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:11,150
one across Italy in another crossed the
the French border

161
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,360
and most you're probably know this when
the Second World War was

162
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,470
up was done how the germans with

163
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,459
superior technology bypass the National
line didn't literally

164
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,810
days an occupied Paris and six weeks

165
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,000
from the outbreak of the war so nine
billion french francs

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,110
greatest the front system ever built and

167
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,920
built from the previous kinda war and
ultimately defeated

168
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,790
index cell what I kinda see happening
today

169
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,599
is almost the same national line analogy

170
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,709
most companies are putting in place very

171
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,880
complicated complex the fence and DEF

172
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,110
model and at every layer of the
architecture of the network in the end

173
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,270
point cloud

174
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,430
we're building incredible architectures
advanced next-generation firewalls

175
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,459
you know proxies for the web gateways
email gateways

176
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:08,050
intrusion detection prevention systems
data loss prevention systems

177
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,390
all kinda sick one Jackson systems and
the list goes on and on

178
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,569
the average company fortune 500 company
spawning spending

179
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:20,160
over 100 million dollars a year in
defense and DEP

180
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,240
pretty amazing numbers what's the
reality

181
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,459
we're seeing almost the same thing
superpowers are bypassing these defense

182
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,510
architectures

183
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,860
in minutes literally in minutes

184
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,329
most you're probably fall the I a pack
event that was here

185
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,530
I'm not too long ago on the attacks can
occur literally an hour

186
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,650
be successful from a Wichita man didn't
fire I responded to to some the

187
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,980
delegation that was speaking at a pic
event here in honolulu

188
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,329
were breached to find what speaker notes

189
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:54,550
what were they speaking about so the
abilities to be able to breach

190
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,859
this complex systems so we see today

191
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,860
its its kinda scary the offense the
defense or completely

192
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,290
just look it and it goes back to almost
what happened in world war 1 going in

193
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,510
the world war two

194
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,130
the architecture is that we have in
place are creating

195
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,130
a massive hole they all have an Achilles
heel

196
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,420
and the understanding of hey I've got
anti-virus I put in these defense in

197
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,760
depth players somebody's gonna find it

198
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,980
I've got thirty forty fifty different
security vendors

199
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,450
I put in all this technology and of
course some secure

200
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,100
and morality is most companies are not
secure

201
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,649
and we're seeing that more than 95
percent of the organizations are

202
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,170
compromised are completely owned

203
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,870
other data exfiltration its massive and
their family

204
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,870
to protect their core IP so we're now at
the dawning

205
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,570
I've just got major ship in terms of
power

206
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,120
are complexity ingenuity to go after an
attack this type of model

207
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,440
and the offense is getting much more
aggressive then the defense

208
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,810
models that are there and of course we
try to

209
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,829
respond to these threats but at the
heart a bit

210
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,160
is a system mo said you know what I was
part of it for

211
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,120
for almost five years McAfee we built
the system's

212
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,940
there any virus model blacklisting
signature pattern matching kind some

213
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,880
models

214
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,269
and what we try to do figure out how to
match a virus

215
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:24,950
we read a signature for with right
thousands on every day

216
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,440
we really for dad engines mobile plan
today

217
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,339
and I would send them out every
computing device McAfee had nearly $300

218
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,990
million computing devices

219
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,709
that we were deployed to and we would
send these out

220
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:42,410
and ultimately became sixty-plus million
signatures or updating every day

221
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,469
and of course the effectiveness of the
system is

222
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,779
not very high today tackle show in a
minute

223
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,139
single-digit effectiveness and what we
do we put that

224
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,380
different anti-virus model from McAfee
or semantic Trend Micro Kaspersky

225
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,649
so foes name vendor for an IPS solutions

226
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,350
something up a firewall we put this
model in place after work

227
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,720
25-year-old model has single-digit
effectiveness

228
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,690
and we look at what's happened you're
seeing that the average breach

229
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,139
from the time of infection the time of
discovery

230
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:22,810
is 243 days this was over almost a
thousand incidences that we responded to

231
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:28,380
over the last two years the average
infection 243 decks

232
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,459
from the time it was placed the time we
discovered it

233
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:34,529
and then ultimately another about 32
days it took

234
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,589
from the climate discovery the time
remediation

235
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,029
for 270 plus days to go from

236
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,329
climb a breach figure it out what's most
interesting is 63 percent of those

237
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:47,479
companies

238
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,980
learned about it from someone else

239
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,160
they couldn't discover with their own
technologies that came from an agency

240
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,060
came from a private vendor an almost all
along

241
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,180
one hundred percent among had up-to-date
anti-virus

242
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,029
and most of them had it at every layer
of the architecture

243
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:09,600
and I'll show you some stats here just a
minute it's kind of an interesting state

244
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,740
of things

245
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,649
spending a hundred million dollars a
year on average fortune 500 company

246
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:18,670
and ultimately ninety-eight percent or
so or breach

247
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,630
most summer finding out from a third
party and most of them have the attacks

248
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,670
in the network

249
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,670
for almost a year kind in the state of
reality of what we're seeing

250
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,089
on the market for fire I we did a little
study

251
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,240
just the kind of prove what we were what
we were seeing and a combination Manian

252
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,980
fire I we looked at

253
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,310
are 1,217 companies

254
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,680
over the course of about a hundred day
period and this was just done recently

255
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,219
I'm from about December tormented and we
did it across to 1,614 appliances at

256
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,149
fire ice sixty seven different countries

257
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:57,769
so this was the first time that we
looked at a network

258
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,459
you through an instant response for
through a fire I appliance

259
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:05,430
and the reality of it was quite
interesting we ended up doing across the

260
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,920
lot of different verticals

261
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,430
financials high-tech government banking

262
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,290
across-the-board again 67 countries
twenty verticals

263
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,839
and what did we end up seeing 225,000
unique pieces I'm our

264
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,110
75 percent seventy-five percent of them

265
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:28,009
were seen one time forty attackers doing
today

266
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:31,870
the right them our very uniquely
targeted at the company

267
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,130
so 1,217 companies all them our

268
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,199
three-quarters of them were seen once

269
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,969
so interesting and about 18 percent
detection rate across

270
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,370
all about at most so that detection rate
was across a thirty day period

271
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,370
the anti-virus vendors found 80 percent
of the time

272
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,779
in the first two or three days and then
openly about thirty day period

273
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,699
they discovered about 18 percent of it
so kind of an interesting stay the

274
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,599
things we sorta look at

275
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,970
kinda some real not you end up seeing
the numbers like this

276
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,920
1/4 about 25 percent Sol an appt

277
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,689
a persistent our advanced attack

278
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,800
about 75 percent of them saw active
command and control server activity

279
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,399
which was using data exfiltration almost
100 percent at them

280
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,769
use foreign crypto graffiti so no its a
cell-type connection

281
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,899
although all types of poppers be used

282
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,000
and of course the average attack was
very regular Matt

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,139
I'll several times a week so these are
kinda the state of things that we it's

284
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:37,699
all

285
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:42,008
and then we're kinda look at all of them
almost a hundred percent along

286
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:45,130
had firewalls web network endpoint

287
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,800
and other anti-malware type solutions on
the host

288
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,269
so elaborate technologies nearly 100
percent for breach

289
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:58,220
most of them having data exfiltration 67
countries twenty verticals

290
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,279
1000 Posco's my point about this

291
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,859
this kind of the National I Networks Inc
the state a fiber security of france

292
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,319
it's far ahead of the defense a model
right now

293
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,668
and we sort of start to look at what's
the motive upper and I have some other

294
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:15,030
superpowers

295
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,589
took an understanding of why this is
gonna just increase

296
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,730
as we move our there's no doubt that
these numbers will continue to increase

297
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,220
we're seeing it regularly and the
ultimate state of things is this

298
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,899
you're starting to see the headlines and
almost ultimately

299
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:34,908
you're seeing what i think is the
greatest transfer wealth in history

300
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:38,730
happening most that's happening from
American the Western world

301
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,260
the emerging markets but the
intellectual property

302
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,530
the dollar fast is now measured in
hundreds of billions of dollars a year

303
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,649
hundreds of billions here pretty
interesting

304
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,760
so minutes or so my is this all you go
what why is it happening

305
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,710
what's causing this and what I find
really interesting as we have almost the

306
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,770
perfect platform

307
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,429
evil like I created in a great way all
this wonderful innovation that we have

308
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:09,810
is amazing every couple months I have a
new cell phone

309
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,889
I'm always connecting on social networks
we all are

310
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:16,250
we all have all this wonderful
information at our disposal

311
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,149
but it's created literally the perfect
platform for the aperture is to leverage

312
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:24,479
and I'm sure over the course of the next
couple days you'll see that

313
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,980
but what are we finding cyberspace

314
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,500
itself this new domain that we have

315
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,399
ISC tremendously flawed from a defense a
point of view

316
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:39,310
why because we have no governance model

317
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,270
where one click away from any website
know world

318
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,530
any search can connect to just about any
domain

319
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,340
ninety-five percent of all the domains
are in the dark nap

320
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,840
today ipv6 and driving towards a new
types of topologies we have on the

321
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,350
network

322
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,540
are adding trillions of addressable
devices

323
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,840
and ultimately we have complete
anonymity on the Internet

324
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,490
the attackers can hide behind whatever
IP address they happen to buy

325
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,919
now with capitalism we can buy domains
for three to five dollars

326
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,770
and we can by tens of thousands of them
without any identification

327
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,290
for kind of an interesting world we're
living in where we've got this perfect

328
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,840
platform set up

329
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,330
and of course most worthy adversaries
are the government's themselves

330
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,570
up superpowers are the ones that are
driving these activities

331
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,399
and it's not directly the superpowers
someone acting on behalf of the

332
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:36,320
superpower

333
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,790
so this isn't gonna change anytime soon

334
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:45,320
for common interesting situation that
we're leveraged and as we move forward

335
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,240
think about this from couple factors in
this is what I find most interesting

336
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,799
what's gonna happen what's the dark side
of this innovation

337
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,129
kinda thing about this and four areas
probably number one

338
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,210
the cyber espionage kinda components
expand

339
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,640
the number countries that were tracking
now how often serve activities

340
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,650
probably is in the 51 or 52 country
range right now

341
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,789
this is up from about eight or ten three
years ago we believe there's about 51

342
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:13,539
countries right now

343
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:17,360
how put in place wanna build research
labs

344
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,090
put an offense if teens funded those
teams

345
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,408
and those teams are very active when it
comes to often so that's been arch

346
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:28,840
and that spread pretty virally across
the world

347
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,270
are part of the report that I mention
the match in online we now track

348
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,370
command-and-control servers and 204
countries

349
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,918
I actually didn't know there is 204
countries combat a huge number

350
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,929
hosted domains that are using to text

351
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:49,020
tration models and leverage with their
telecommunication systems for

352
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,280
om exultation up information so we're
gonna continue to see this

353
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,250
on the amount a recruitment coming out
the military and most other countries

354
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,190
around the world extreme

355
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,610
when we see the Syrian and the Iranian
activities how much we're improving

356
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,870
every couple months you can see the
knowledge transference occurring

357
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,639
into these parts the marketplace not
talk about that just a minute as well

358
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,750
probably the biggest change we're seeing
recently some the cyber sabotage pipes

359
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,750
apart now work it's

360
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,260
on no intent whatsoever to steal the
entire intention

361
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,940
is so destroyed we've seen several cases
in the United States just in the last

362
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,559
hour

363
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,340
60 to 90 days summer which were very
high profiled

364
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,199
one involving one the largest casinos in
Las Vegas

365
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,409
due to a comment the CEO made about a
particular country

366
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:44,220
alternately on came about with a massive
attack in four days

367
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,440
so in this particular attack high and
David destruction types of

368
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,890
worms were deployed ultimately with a
spear phishing front and

369
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,260
but was able to be put together in a
four day period

370
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,350
that brought down the company for five
straight days

371
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,280
so common interesting time where the
motivations

372
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,320
are not only just offer crime or for
intellectual property

373
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,678
but now for hatred religious purposes

374
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,780
other types at your political purposes
as well

375
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,950
other types things the crime element has
really hit

376
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,440
equity markets so most have you probably
see this

377
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,960
are a lot of changes occurred from what
I think up this high volume

378
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,350
low credit card low dollar amount types
a crime still made famous by targeting a

379
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,340
few others

380
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,789
but we're seeing a tremendous amount
insider trading types of activities

381
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:35,850
today

382
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,360
and a lot of hedging of that insider
trading information

383
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,889
a lot of the breach responses were doing
we only find three or four or five

384
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,840
are breached a host and what are those
hoes

385
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,370
arm people doing Financial Controller

386
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,600
investment relations personnel anybody
who was high

387
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,830
access information for the whole idea

388
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,168
get access to the information hedge the
stock

389
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,590
hedge the commodities get information
ahead of the market

390
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,029
make money that way very very difficult
to track that

391
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:11,190
with very little regulation in place to
do it

392
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,720
and most the attackers are using bank
account somewhere in the world

393
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,279
with the number of degrees of anonymity
so a tremendous amount of change

394
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,690
in the way in which the crime elements
occurring as well

395
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,880
and a lot happening in the Eastern
European marketplace today

396
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,630
last one which is probably more
frightening one which I had experience

397
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,580
with directly

398
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,610
is a bit accidental problem

399
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,658
with all this activity that's occurring
from so many different groups

400
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:41,980
we now track about 300 offenses actors
in the world

401
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,529
studio flies over 300 motivated group

402
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:48,559
most amor playing now with very very

403
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,010
arm interesting areas of the operating
environment so the stocks that we all

404
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,029
you'll find comfort in the BIOS a woman
so far

405
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:01,049
of our infrastructure our critical
infrastructure

406
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:05,450
weather for transportation in the sky
transportation on the ground

407
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,880
are critical energies and a lot of the
activity

408
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,000
is directly related to trying to monitor
it

409
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,730
steel firm at and of course the
slightest state can cause an accident

410
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,909
and we've seen a number of scenarios are
this close

411
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:23,850
to creating an accident and some the
accidents can actually occur from the

412
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,020
security vendors themselves

413
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,230
were from the vendor trying to patch it
in an emergency patch conaway

414
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,900
I don't know if you follow a fire I too
much but we just really stop

415
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,179
a major zero-day in Internet Explorer
couple weeks ago called

416
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,890
and that's fine Fox contest but Fox was
your day we discovered in one of our

417
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,990
in San responding areas hit not only XP
but all the way through

418
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:54,159
all the Microsoft platforms Microsoft
was absolutely amazing in the process

419
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,789
and help patch all the systems women to
patching several hundred million devices

420
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,120
in a 22-hour period

421
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,289
I to help remove the vulnerability and

422
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:07,490
within a weekend we had gone from

423
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,289
non discovery for patch management 22
hours

424
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:14,370
very difficult to Q way that process to
be successful

425
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,570
there was a mistake along the way you
can reach massive infrastructure and

426
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,250
equip your time

427
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,029
when that McAfee released a faulty that
something might now

428
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:27,100
was called 59-58 was centered out out

429
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,439
it up porn king the food execute a ball
on Windows I'll Service Pack 2

430
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,330
and we took down three million computers
and 16 minutes

431
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,740
over I think sixteen hundred companies
so the accident problem

432
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,190
couple was from a crime sabotage an
espionage

433
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:50,400
sorta creating a very interesting dark
side to the scenarios were facing

434
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,370
so again for to be to ominous here but
we gotta think about how do we close the

435
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,350
defense and the offense

436
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,168
this is probably the number one top that
i think is a community

437
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:04,429
up security professionals we have to
figure out

438
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,200
what can we do to get it back to very

439
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,049
incremental offense and defense activity
right now that gap

440
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,629
is enormous the power the money the
complexity

441
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,250
persons what the defense can do is too
great

442
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,650
and it's gonna create when I showed you
as a problem

443
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,340
so as you think about this evolution you
know we have the birth of anti-virus

444
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,250
as you started to see those first pipes
a virus attacks occurred

445
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,830
million no code Red Melissa love you
viruses things like that

446
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,678
I remember tracking someone owes of
course my favorite person John McAfee

447
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,059
guys remember this guy

448
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,100
I am his he helped invent that

449
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,000
and of course I i think is now involved
with security began but

450
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,279
little scary up but nonetheless

451
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,690
we've seen a huge evolution other types
of of France

452
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,039
and pipes from our creation that's being
used

453
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,179
and of course the defense keeps trying
to follow along

454
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,779
in years past particularly in the last
10 years

455
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,330
which a pretty close correlation right
about the time we started to see

456
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,510
advanced persistent threats nation-state
activity at a much higher level

457
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,720
with all that just location change
dramatically and not really

458
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,279
obsoleted a lot of the technology but I
talked about before everything from

459
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,470
blacklisting

460
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,649
using anti virus the blacklisting using
data loss prevention

461
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,870
Trojan detection systems a blacklisting

462
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,158
web URL but everything there began to
break apart

463
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,279
as we watch the model move forward so
where we are today

464
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,149
we now have to figure out a way to do a
different type of analysis

465
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:49,070
a different way to think about things
and it's exacerbated by

466
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:53,450
the fact that almost all the offense is
using dark net domains

467
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,960
to start an import rate their attacks

468
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,470
and I'll show you in just a second
almost a hundred percent of the attacks

469
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,409
will start with the visible web

470
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:06,140
had a whaler you to click on a Web site
how do I start

471
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,669
exploit to occur but then all the
command-and-control server activity

472
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:16,399
is all happening in the dark nap stuff
that's protected by password

473
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,860
stuff that's highly cryptid none of
which is using

474
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,959
standard for Parker fee most the which
is using anonymity

475
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,710
hide behind and ultimately we have a lot
of

476
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,770
combinations here between the visible
net and the Internet

477
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,970
to access so what are the attackers
trying to focus on

478
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:41,029
here's what we see almost the number one
area the attackers will do first

479
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,820
the offense a model typically starts
going after high-tech

480
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,418
almost all the cases that we see the
large campaigns that are launched

481
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:52,820
most of them came from an attack on
high-tech sector first

482
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,260
what do I mean by that typically it
happened where

483
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,520
a startup company a cloud based company
whether

484
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,510
an Adobe or no work or microsoftr Apple
or Google or something like that or

485
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,590
smaller company

486
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,709
appt for put in place to go after
critical source code

487
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,370
about some sort of digital trust
certificate something to gain access

488
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,639
for the core of the application as as

489
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,130
on known as possible once we have access

490
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,049
to that we can start to put technology
in place that has much longer

491
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:26,260
persistency

492
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,510
than any other types of malware that
could be used

493
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,250
so huge number the attack vectors we're
seeing measured in hundreds and hundreds

494
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,330
the company's

495
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,090
come from this type of attack gain
access to the bug database

496
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:43,250
source code learn how to load DLL try to
do something that enables it to be

497
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,820
are invisible to the the current systems
levers that vulnerability

498
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,710
use an exclusive or some sort
polymorphic technique

499
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,240
and then stage in overtime

500
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,110
maybe in the first instance its use to
download the exploit weeks up a couple

501
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,299
weeks later

502
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,629
it takes another command and then all
tingly creating

503
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,720
a multi-stage the pack over a period of
time sometimes lasting

504
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,070
years as we move forward so what are
they ultimately do you

505
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,090
the leverage it across multiple
fractures in the architecture

506
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,199
I can come in through five different
domains weekend the sea

507
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,250
a lot of it is now moved into the
bring-your-own-device Syria your

508
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,210
smartphone

509
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,640
where some cider take on device this
area is probably most prevalent today

510
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,990
particularly with the Google platform I
think we're now up over ninety percent

511
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,110
the attacks were emanated from the

512
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,158
from the Android platform into a spear
fish

513
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,029
not just with the email but now into the
mobile of course it's attacking and

514
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:44,370
multiple areas and what's happened is
that national

515
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,668
architecture that we have is exploited
because these products don't work well

516
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:49,970
together

517
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,419
they don't communicate from one to
another and it creates

518
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:57,600
holes in the architecture as we move
forward pretty interesting

519
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,559
scenario if you look at the types of
attacks that occur

520
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,529
these are the stages we typically see
stage 1

521
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:11,220
drop in explain in understand how to get
it to a unique individual in the room

522
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,429
load that exploit down to your device
put it memory

523
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,769
start to communicate back to a
command-and-control server

524
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:22,240
low-down cryptography work back and
forth with a command-and-control server

525
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,360
that alternately crepe cryptid data
exfiltration commands

526
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,610
that's creates probably most powerful
own ultimately they're going to reach

527
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,389
that my work they can

528
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,899
and then create valor potential login we
get the combination

529
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:41,110
getting the exploit in erasing them our
and then walking in

530
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:46,010
validly for a long period of time
recreates the architecture we have today

531
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,399
on average 243 days unknown

532
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:53,600
a pretty interesting model keeps
evolving with these attackers

533
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,699
this is a global cyber threat map kinda
illustrate the picture

534
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,970
you can see in the back this map here

535
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,690
shows how many command-and-control
servers for monitoring every day

536
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,960
we're now up to about 60 million
command-and-control servers globally

537
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,090
all using the Dark Knight components
that I described earlier

538
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,580
most the which are using APT's to talk
back and forth to the servers

539
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,260
I on an average day we're seeing someone
a neighborhood a few hundred thousand

540
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,720
new exploits occur someone a
neighborhood a few million

541
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,510
command-and-control server
communications and it targets summer

542
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,600
neighborhood

543
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,879
of I think it's ninety percent

544
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,799
in high tech sector initially and then
openly emanating out

545
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:44,309
from multiple verticals so she kinda
watch this map occur

546
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:48,250
you'll start to see that this ATT model

547
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:53,250
that we're using is coming across over
200 countries as well

548
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,779
a pretty powerful combinations where
multi-stage the tax

549
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:00,070
coming in lasting for 100 today's

550
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,689
coming across the globe hundreds of
thousands have unique communications

551
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,230
and of course most of the earth is very
difficult to track who the actual

552
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:14,690
address serious

553
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,070
you can see some the numbers that are up
there

554
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,070
one particular point to make sixty-seven
percent of what we tracked

555
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,860
were from known good command-and-control
servers as well

556
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,629
this is the their own website in some
cases the first hop

557
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:36,490
is often a waterhole website from the
company that's being infected

558
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,850
we've made a couple those are famous was
from the blog but

559
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,699
in the case for like a target or some
others the actual sleep the website

560
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,960
itself was actually the launch point

561
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,190
for the command-and-control server
activity initially that ultimately

562
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,850
became a dark nat type a command and
control server

563
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,189
up give you a kind of idea of summer the

564
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:00,409
APT campaigns that we're seeing
across-the-board high-tech that the

565
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:00,980
fence

566
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,419
for telecom and so forth these APT's

567
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:07,659
common across many verticals won their
first deployed

568
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:11,210
from you probably know go Strathearn
couple others a

569
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,389
be bustle talk about the second but

570
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,620
they're very migratory for once we see
even one

571
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,009
sector will seem kinda crossed many many
industries in a pretty quick period of

572
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,210
time

573
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,679
here's the example I just mentioned
operation the bus

574
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,359
now some you know this the bus this was
on the defense industrial base

575
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,639
about a year ago or so it was targeted
the UAV use this is the unmanned aerial

576
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,830
vehicles

577
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,069
they are attack initially came in from
China

578
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:47,699
initially linked with the PT 1 but the
idea there was the Spearfish

579
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:51,580
getting APTN steal from the AutoCAD the
repository

580
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,600
can access the UAV information and then
ultimately we've now seen that activity

581
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,790
permeate in

582
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,310
replicated you a vis in the marketplace
in China with some %uh their defense

583
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,640
industrial base

584
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,000
and of course the idea there is to keep
up with the latest defense technology

585
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,980
up five stages attack mobile hops a
command-and-control servers

586
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,740
several hundred days undetected and
ultimately arriving in

587
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,379
a very successful attack Matt mechanism

588
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,830
we look at the big four superpowers just
the kinda wrap it up in summary here

589
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,000
you'll see

590
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,210
we have a lot happening in the China
were Jim

591
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,690
we have twenty two groups were tracking
across the Army Navy

592
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,859
I People's Liberation Army for bureau
and my sass

593
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:42,279
these organizations are highly focused
in on are

594
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:45,420
areas of espionage in activity rarely do
we see

595
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,700
for crime activities related to dollars
and financials

596
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,379
most the activity is to feed the
emerging markets

597
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,470
in the middle east we're seeing similar
to these Russia similar activities

598
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:02,129
not most of which are gaining momentum
every couple weeks every couple months

599
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,850
and resulting in pretty successful
attacks officer look at the Chinese

600
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,540
playbook a little closer

601
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,890
you'll see not only is the activities
focused

602
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,129
entirely on innovation and high-tech

603
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:19,670
but now it's pretty viral around the
world as well not just on the US markets

604
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,880
were seen incredible man are actively in
Japan problem

605
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,260
activity in Germany are some other
higher innovation countries

606
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,620
lots of focus in that region

607
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,580
and you start to look at the strategy
low-profile

608
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,810
the night bility trying to orchestrate
this across

609
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,410
schemes and of course a lot of pretty
known attacks have occurred

610
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:49,410
and a pretty quick period of time
something which I I mentioned her

611
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:53,279
these are some other famous hackers that
were indicted in the %uh Pittsburgh

612
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:54,910
federal court

613
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,089
summer which are very active to this day

614
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:01,210
none of which will actually see a court
I'm sure

615
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,440
parts are pretty interesting for the
first time in history were seen the

616
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,180
indictment

617
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,870
Chinese military officers my opinion
will see an equal and opposite reaction

618
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,940
occur from time in the next couple
months

619
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,339
we've already gone see it pipe this
event here will create

620
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:20,589
a pretty interesting whiplash back

621
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:24,060
the US markets in my opinion we look at
russia

622
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,900
somewhere activity tremendous activity
focused on crime

623
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,799
what's the focus coming out of the
Ukrainian markets crimean markets

624
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:35,520
russian businessmen network markets in
saint petersburg

625
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,190
lot of focus and on high arm

626
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,609
high-volume low dollar types of
activities

627
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:46,719
prickly with the equity markets credit
card market step occurred markets

628
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,040
a lot of %uh interesting personnel
involved here

629
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,609
I want my favorite to our summer the pot
notes that were brought down

630
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:57,580
and a particular letter that was used
public can see it back there but

631
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,410
om this was a letter back the fire I
after we brought down their botnet

632
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,420
and of course what's the saying I what
are you doing

633
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,680
why are you bringing down the spot nap
you have no ability to affect

634
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,799
the about the outcome assessors no
criminal prosecution were protected by

635
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:15,980
the government

636
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,319
and I'll this is a waste of time
basically so interesting to watch

637
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:24,549
the protectionism that's occurring from
the government's in most of these

638
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:26,460
criminal activities

639
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,489
and another example of that we just
watched with target and a few other

640
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:34,230
major retailers Middle East some more

641
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:39,069
much more focused on kind of
geopolitical activities

642
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:42,509
we've seen a tremendous amount
affectively coming from the FTA

643
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:46,480
recently on as well as Ajax security
group in Iran

644
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,940
against sabotage focused lot of activity

645
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,190
targeted towards hi sensationalism
critical infrastructure

646
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:59,190
I cannot focus on our destruction as
much as possible

647
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,620
we've seen a number these from these are
pretty famous you probably know I'm

648
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,750
routes gas around

649
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,049
around coast from the more radical
bodies that occurred as well

650
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:10,230
and most recently the casino

651
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,420
so do you think about all this activity
that's occurring you know what we

652
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,339
flaming

653
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,690
highly persistent actors highly
polymorphic activities

654
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,960
leveraging all these new domains that
are occurring multi-stage the tax

655
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,009
very interesting you know zero-day type
celebrity from source code and high-tech

656
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:28,850
actors

657
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:34,089
environments and ultimately crated a
very different threat landscape

658
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:38,540
over the next few years and we've been
seeing in the past

659
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,779
so part when I try to communicate when I
come to these events

660
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:46,520
is how do we think about changing the
way in which we do security

661
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,420
how do we begin tonight the communities
that we have together

662
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,699
products won't solve this we won't be
able to close the gap immediately with a

663
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:54,670
product

664
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,650
but if we can improve the learnings and
the people on the expertise

665
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,449
couple that with the products put
together a better process

666
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:07,449
we probably can close the gap a little
closer and we have today

667
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,870
so with that I just wanna say I think
we're seeing a change occur

668
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,520
a pretty big shift I think we have to
reimagine summer this

669
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,140
this is what we're trying to do if I
rise focus and on a whole new generation

670
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,020
of technology

671
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,549
using virtual machines the idea there is
to create a much stronger learning

672
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,930
environment for attacks

673
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,460
not only know what's going on from known
attacks but also unknown is your day

674
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,359
typeof attacks and be able to put these
working machines

675
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,420
in nearly every area of the architecture
from the web

676
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,230
email profile to mobile and ultimately
through 10 points

677
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,580
if we can put a different type of model
than any virus in place and have it

678
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,219
learn from each other

679
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,170
we can probably create a better
architecture to be

680
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:57,040
proactive with the intelligence be much
faster at the attack learning

681
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,640
and then labor sat across the globe
quickly

682
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,930
so we believe that creates a a nice
change from where we were before

683
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,419
with antivirus corrected

684
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,420
get still there all right thank you very
much I really appreciate it

685
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:19,420
and thanks for your time alright here

686
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,619
ok cool

687
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:31,240
I get official t-shirt shirt thank you
knife

688
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,250
I read baghdad from

689
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,380
fire Edgar carriers have to get nowhere

690
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,589
I well i were now

691
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:45,980
what up through the questions were up

692
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,240
and then we can answer up

693
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:51,640
love up
