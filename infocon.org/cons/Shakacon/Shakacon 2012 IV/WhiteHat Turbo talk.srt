basics for operations security

23
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:40,119
for you stall maybe security with
checkbox there's a whole different level

24
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,600
that needs to be done to provide

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,490
real security organization it knows best

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,640
cold weather station point of view we
leave Green Bay

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,729
the we went to the heart of my cycle
design

28
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,610
secure software senator your
requirements 30

29
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,469
actually you with security in mind doing
stuff now is the moment

30
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,669
are writing code be able I sassy

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,300
I'm always have a decir for and a heel
you have a seven-acre das

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,650
well it there's a way to do with the

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,739
what will you do with information
security this manual has

36
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:29,750
become an annual highness

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,510
once in a while yeah place some degree
but again when you calling in

38
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,510
professional our organization organized
crime

39
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,440
nation-state raging this are they doing

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,720
national and against you want were
Norway

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,920
for looking at you in childhood issue
not

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,500
on a regular basis using a combination
of money

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,730
people so you're gay in love nonstop
that accompanied the

44
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,190
playing time says these two teams don't
meet up we need to do something

45
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,709
different

46
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,849
and I think the answers it was
monitoring I about

47
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:12,129
ski and once a week or even just day i'm
talking about. not

48
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,609
of money world K he was not

49
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,220
all your different virus that's how
donde

50
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,959
rather face today the game although not
I'll

51
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,299
your room my website because we have a
lot of want to hear mark

52
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,040
website with me and ingestion legal
injected

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,280
reminder marketing website database

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,069
then use that as a jumping-off place to
compromise rather organization

55
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,149
so i think is I want it I'll looking

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,420
everyone over whether yes then consider
security

57
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,540
something about it he was base so

58
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,970
her soul first is our for

59
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,459
from problem not yourself hurt while

60
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,819
her soul Hernando I he was

61
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,179
24/7 base incomes are service

62
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,379
well-handled White House primarily

63
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,790
is a dynamic web application scanning
service

64
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,390
we use people were people are bad we use
whatever means

65
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,519
for automation is bad we use a little
high profits hi all together

66
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,500
so you know restore dry scrying

67
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,530
to assessment for you yeah we

68
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,780
what happened it was good luck for were
you are relevant to the credential

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,549
and you're done very much smaller as a
service and so are you

70
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,199
or you busy her only understand her
already underbody

71
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,220
there's amid fresh trying to get things
done

72
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,840
the whole were lovely settle is of

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,650
the resources that are missing and so
once we start on board in your web page

74
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,948
you must protect URL really his

75
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,020
no homo chto 40 percent

76
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,630

159
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,360
people were people are less you want to
rely on the system's

160
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,950
and use a real profit I altogether
that's how evil

161
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,610
scale handle so many web sites I don't
know that we do

162
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,709
level Wales where gracious critical

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:26,869
it will not be shipped by Russia

164
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,140
this is a real the numerical specialized

165
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,540
are all to block patient rather

166
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,069
well parlour her if you throw in here

167
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,870
also yeah II peace are all

168
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,350
the power of its limited it doesn't have
to contact

169
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,269
a little really happening in your
application and we partner with

170

171
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,779
firewall yeah

172
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,870
merely you the scanner we manually be
here

173
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,700
verified every single one early your
business logic has angered

174
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,730
necessary and now I'm home call the
house analysis

175
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,190

cool firewall not so much you general
said

179
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:26,529
polls into that one specific
vulnerability

180
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,709
now we're a nation our moscow our I'm

181
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,040
to stop a real threat to your iraqi we
have

182
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,469
mole integration fishing are all I was

183
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,730
philosophically never a whole European
marble

184
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,240
Oklahoma methodology think this is how
it should be done

185
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,279
providing a bitch viral with really
challenges

186
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,420
be very effective not inherently again
specific

187
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,860
reliability without peace har har

188
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,410
funny service again when the with the

193
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:17,019
behind data that is well it helps to
make the decision

194
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,899
his last know who also just put into
this

195
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:26,010
now industry we're also doing call
analysis loom reliability

196
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,819
the computational Daz his act together
very powerful

197
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,230
co announces you know there's a

we went to Red Bull over hattori's week

200
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,470
code we grand coulee repository Billy
Mays is

201
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,529
we manually review that being on the
water bill

202
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,829
standard we can resolve without a house
said

203
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:56,489
all sound analysis we want to redo the
whole

204
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,329
office and no HW was and analysis

205
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,989
well matched easy United yes for
developers have a question how is this

206
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,139
where r service remediation of tomorrow
world

207
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,940
well and up rumor coming up with the

and laughed a lot of other

210
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,050
style now solutions out there we feel
that what we're doing is third

211
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,800
generation

212
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,660
how to get all of this erecting close to
the core mockery

213
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,310
you'll have to stand by and wait for
hours

214
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,550
there's trending data over time the
scaling his

215
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,279
on-site don't have a home to go to a
cloud service

216
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,529
expert I in these are rare in your
environment

217
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,540
its reasonable haha is not just a
one-time

218
