1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,250
okay well thanks Jason

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,839
my name's jury Brianna from Microsoft I
may 6 senior security strategist with

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,769
the Microsoft Security Response Center
I'll

4
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:15,330
someone you may know what am i calling
for name is Katie Saurus

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,699
and she's 1/2 for the team that I'm on
their

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,590
kinda runs programs for outreach to the
security researcher community

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,670
last week we announced

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,640
new bounty programs this is kind of a
new area for Microsoft

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,640
but are very programs our little bit
different

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,219
then what you might be used to seeing
out there today

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,489
soda to give an idea we have three
different programs that we announced

12
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:46,190
one is called the mitigation bypass
mounting a

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,890
and I'll talk a little bit more details
about each one of these a but this is

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,910
basically up two hundred thousand
dollars for

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,949
a novel medication bypass about the blue
had known as for defense is an

16
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:00,469
additional fifty thousand dollars for

17
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,600
I'll basically defenses a

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
defensive ideas related to the
mitigation bypasses in the

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,380
the the first program and then the third
one is

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,649
a the IEEE 11 preview but downey

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,670
which will run for about 30 days

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,090
as two days ago a and I'll talk a little
bit more about it or the so

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,530
the medication bypass banning basically
we're looking for holes in the shield so

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,920
these are platform wide a medications
that we're looking at that this'll are

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,759
things like that

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,150
I'll basically if you can

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,909
you to figure out how to exploit that
way bypasses medications

28
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,890
I'll and provide us with enough details
would give you up two hundred thousand

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,680
dollars

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,130
for that particular issue so

31
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,189
this program is not a one-time only
program this is a

32
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:58,789
an ongoing program so a it's not a
contest at all I think

33
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,860
I'll one one %uh the gentleman out here
mentioned earlier that

34
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,549
we were running a contest that black hat
for how to

35
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:11,750
be emit that's not quite true basically
the thing we're doing at Black Cat

36
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,489
is if if you have a mitigation bypassing
you want to bring it

37
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,040
two are both the black hat we will be

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,030
doing live point if you got it there and
paying out

39
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,110
hundred thousand dollars or probably not
right

40
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,290
by cap shortly after so

41
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,209
the a blue hat for defense a has
everybody in the room

42
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,069
heard over blue have prize contest that
we ran over the last couple years

43
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,399
this was a a defensive contest we

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,629
awarded over 250,000 dollars last year

45
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,120
black hat a four defensive technology

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,000
%uh so that was like a one-time-only
contest this is kind of an ex

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,159
the continuation of that so this goes
kinda hand in hand with the mitigation

48
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,340
bypassed founding

49
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,200
where a if you you know discover way to
bypass or medications and you can also

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,040
supply

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,030
a a an effective defense for that
there's an additional there's a

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,230
possibility for an additional fifty
thousand dollars

53
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,649
for for that now

54
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,659
the I 11 preview bug bounty so

55
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:25,679
again this this will run for 30 days

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,670
as I love the release of the preview
which was two days ago on

57
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,369
on the 26 and the reason why

58
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,010
we're running this during the beta
period is there are quite a few

59
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,920
a brokerage houses that will buy your
exploits

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,319
and you know eventually share those with
the vendors

61
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,359
such as Microsoft and a we're not trying
to

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,750
you know really enter in that space but
know those vendors actually

63
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,080
offer any sort of brownies for programs
in the bay the state so

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,099
you can see on the chart here the light
gray color this represents

65
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:08,149
I'll I intenso on the left hand side you
can see

66
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,700
the bug reports that we got externally
while the program is in beta

67
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,700
and as soon as we shifted we got a sharp

68
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,029
enclose increase a bug reports from

69
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,609
external researchers so basically
because nobody's getting paid

70
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,430
a to report bugs turn a beta period

71
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,590
there you know hang onto them until
after we release the product

72
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,909
and then we we get the reports they get
paid that can think so what we're trying

73
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,979
to do here is

74
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,120
encourage people to report bugs during
beta so that we can fix them

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,979
before what's the product so this will
only go for about 30 days

76
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,449
I so few are doing in kinda research on
Internet Explorer

77
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,090
the you can go download the when does a
point one preview

78
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:02,090
along with I 11 and start coming for
bucks

79
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,009
so just so kinda re recap this

80
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,979
the barony for I 11 preview only runs
for

81
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,430
30 days I'll and hopefully by black cat
will

82
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,960
will start to build a up release
information on how many bugs with

83
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,190
we're getting to that program again a
few

84
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,900
wanna come to the booth I think we're
going to be

85
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,070
running the contest not the conscious
but a

86
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,770
anybody who wants to demonstrate an
exploit at our booth

87
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:40,240
during the lunch hour black each day

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,650
so obviously there's a there's a lot
love kinda

89
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,109
rules to the program a so if you want to
find out more

90
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,159
got a Microsoft dot com slash spending
programs there you can

91
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,800
find all the rules for each one of these
programs and how

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,229
how to engage with them also a

93
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:02,789
loss at TechNet dot com slash blue hat

94
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,150
I think we're missing an ass there it
should be blogs

95
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,979
tech meetup com a we made a blog post
they're talking about

96
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,628
why we're doing this and white now if

97
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:18,249
you have this kind of questions I'll
follow us on Twitter

98
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:23,839
I'll at Katy Moeller is the basically
she's the owner the program so

99
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,080
if you wanna hit her up on Twitter a
she's a good

100
