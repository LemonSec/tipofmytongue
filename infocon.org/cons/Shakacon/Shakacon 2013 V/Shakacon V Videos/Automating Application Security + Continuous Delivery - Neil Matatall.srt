1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,160
is an hour I think so

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,049
us

3
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:17,049
night it's there track

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Rights Watch

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,760
you

6
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:54,800
RICS a

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,120
so really happy to have him here today
can yes please welcome in with though

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,120
round of applause thanks in was easy as
a cop

9
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,330
guessing thats so

10
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,140
thanks everyone for coming to the top
full disclosure have a drink red Bull

11
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,119
years literally shaking right now I
might go through talk we've asked me to

12
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:20,930
I'm

13
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,340
just another reason I want currently
asking questions during the talk

14
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,770
into office it becomes block just
ignoring

15
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,270
so I put on a mission quotes

16
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,399
because as I automation people are
saying like

17
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,420
like oh I don't really think that is
automation like

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,399
I don't think that is on don't really
care because I think it is

19
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,220
but I also say

20
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,440
sort of change the talk apologies to you

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,490
the people for the sock on I promise
it's not like

22
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,600
bait switch thing just how I approach a
little differently

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,848
some talk about the history and access
to Twitter we talk about

24
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,739
history and Twitter have to mention will
make it a rule you fired if we don't do

25
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:04,039
it

26
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,269
I I'm glad guys often

27
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:11,510
and then at the same time have talked
about how proper bombers

28
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,829
out packed many many years ago

29
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,620
I which drew the attention these
wonderful people

30
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,190
FTC dearly love I

31
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,030
if actually the content services coming

32
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,140
interesting explains the bonehead things
we were doing

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,179
like publicly accessible at with
passwords that are like

34
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,379
call into don't

35
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,879
table it's really not that good but if
you look at their suggestions

36
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,640
like equally as bad I but either way

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,359
or under this order for the next twenty
years have an effective information

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,530
security program

39
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,750
every time you mess up adds another 20
years

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,970
aside starts over so obviously twenty
years in the world

41
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,620
computing pretty unrealistic but anyways

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,999
ted koppel philosophical sort of guide

43
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:07,319
this is certain recent things

44
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,399
response to but it's been pretty helpful
these are not like ground breaking

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,609
things but there's things that we just
like you mine

46
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,230
everything we do 15 right information to
the right people

47
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,569
that's two separate things in there the
right information

48
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,638
right people giving someone PDF it comes
out any tool that anyone uses

49
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,939
is just irresponsible most people
supports you can understand

50
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,299
and also you probably to way to meet
people

51
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,760
Nordic bus could be possible

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,399
probably the most obvious one door

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
States if you

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,739
she making the same mistake over and
over like enough no one to blame but

55
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:52,450
yourself

56
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:59,029
the best indicator expert is the free
iceman's

57
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:03,129
I think this is the one we take close to
heart we don't use a single

58
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,349
don't use a single service we don't use
a couple service

59
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,918
we throw every single tool it make sense
to do so

60
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,719
at each application you can sit there
and try to get like

61
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:18,440
perfect USADA abstentions days days
treat each application where you just

62
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,488
throw punches holes and cover
eighty-percent

63
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,840
case and hope to overlap get close to
100 percent

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,340
has no tool is perfect period help
people help themselves

65
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,638
we can always been a police people
always want to do the right thing

66
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,220
anyways

67
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,530
so provide mechanisms to let them do the
right thing wanna make them work

68
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,599
if you push there's no reason you should
be pushing up

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,330
cutie Taylor

70
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,080
my girlfriend was show pics details

71
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,060
strong crush on her but another very
important thing

72
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,590
only use tools that make sense for you
I'm

73
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,638
string of familiar with the concept
continues every for so I'm not an expert

74
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,890
just happens that we're doing these
things falls into this category

75
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,300
but the way I summarize is

76
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,380
you want to be able to deploy by pushing
a button

77
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,719
everything should be automated
everything should be streamlined

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,520
everything should be nice what is any
means

79
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,750
anyone can push that button generally
means

80
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,820
deploy happen out a schedule but

81
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,890
reality is no schedule with continues to
live you might deploy

82
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,490
seven times once a week the thing is
there's no schedule

83
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,940
and what does it mean to you traditional
security waterfall its

84
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,880
don't work at all get these people to at
least

85
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,310
come to use a huge win but if you're
required to be there for every single

86
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,970
deployed

87
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,920
very very unpopular and you can to whole

88
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,110
had just like as companies grow

89
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,240
like every cup with

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,530
spoken to generally understaffed

91
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,070
this is like a very generous graphic
it's completely made up

92
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,460
because in for a sec ones actually
rowing as the companies grow

93
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,950
not as fast as it should this is pretty
much

94
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,200
the best case scenario that i've seen

95
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,060
you know a little background on what
makes up Twitter

96
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,060
this is for her to a very crudely drawn
time graf we were mostly rails

97
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,570
an hour getting to be more and more
style but we've got some

98
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,150
no doubt got a lot of JavaScript lying
around libraries

99
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,989
got some PHP Drupal there's a lot going
on

100
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,880
so I would consider myself an expert in
Python

101
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,370
or PHP but we use tools to make up

102
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,300
assertive summary or a combination once
the principles

103
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,570
only buy tools bill in a great tools

104
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,130
make sense he asks questions useful

105
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,430
probably question scale

106
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,570
thats the results easily digest

107
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,750
Kenny consumed in some way again it's
PDF report

108
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,010
never used chase on XML

109
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,080
some weakened

110
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,750
100 percent on me use the tool again if

111
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,110
can't do that and of course that's how

112
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,790
stale so the email security workforce
just like this

113
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,270
run a tool you go to read it comes back

114
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,130
you look at the reports use or to me we
do things

115
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,610
fix stuff but then you just can repeat
the cycle

116
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,340
there is already a few min steps and
some stat

117
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,159
use these automated text per euro bus to
work

118
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,230
are getting to you sir all the things
stuff but again

119
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,570
we're not pushing any buttons

120
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,260
sontag a break break stock analysis tool
for Rails

121
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,789
it works

122
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:17,070
you see a quite dramatic drop of the
Seas

123
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,040
so useful yes

124
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,790
scale absolutely finance I can also
store

125
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,440
that runs on something with you know
million lines

126
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,809
back in about a minute find too many

127
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:37,559
if they're his would like to use those
tools

128
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,669
and then on the Twitter dot com base
which was at one point the largest rails

129
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,260
base in the world takes about two and a
half

130
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,500
now when you're on break

131
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,850
way from process

132
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,079
see i on

133
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,779
code would be really good when you run
it s

134
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,529
I would be really good most people at
least make sure it has passed before the

135
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,790
push to production but ideally you want
to do this

136
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:21,790
when you say

137
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,950
for Twitter applications we have
absolutely zero false positives

138
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,070
party the reason behind that is

139
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,920
someone only tool and every time see a
false-positive

140
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,709
be treated as a bow has to get fixed
because we're doing a service

141
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,540
surely automated fashion a false
positive is just gonna make this

142
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,540
whole process ten times more cumbersome

143
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,610
we do regression testing so by fixing a
false-positive

144
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,480
injury cover-up a previous finding like
that's the worst we definitely

145
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,540
say a false negative is higher priority
false-positive but

146
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,670
false negatives are a lot of heart
reviewing

147
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,410
and sick of this another file

148
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,110
this is funny

149
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,329
as possible there are some tools are in
stock

150
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:39,089
houses before you hit Save I guess it's
fast

151
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,610
so this is the traditional graph that
shows the continues delivery

152
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,999
cycle so as you can see it's all about
getting

153
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:52,279
seems possible running as Tess also if
you look at

154
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,189
individual lines this a trigger trigger
there's only one manual process in this

155
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:56,939
entire thing

156
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:00,170
us the check so

157
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:07,170
how to reply brief first watching a
massive ranch this is usually after

158
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:12,029
production not deploy scripts

159
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:16,990
this is a big win for us basically
before they deploy the code inch

160
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,120
make sure no new Phillies have been
introduced little kickback thing

161
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,459
was quite nice had a lot of confidence
this and we thought

162
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:31,649
what about if we just for some code
every time someone submits a branch for

163
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,029
view to on runs false

164
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:39,339
this got a lot of pushback from missus
too invasive even if it only takes 20

165
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:40,129
seconds to run

166
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:43,999
requirement on every run which is
essentially triple the amount I'm

167
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,149
takes interview didn't make us very
popular this is not in use today

168
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,550
and then we came up with secure

169
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:57,339
mission dashboard also Sat this is

170
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,660
up to circumvent dense first what's at
is only focusing on the reals part

171
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,069
but this is where the security
management anyone can go see

172
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:12,469
the status quo security across too
exaggerated

173
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,600
grossly suicide do

174
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,689
you know going back to graft sorry for
the developer will push code

175
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:24,920
armies as job just like a private

176
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,128
task service thing for the code

177
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:32,949
run break send the results to sad just
wrong results chase on

178
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:36,410
and sadly actually makes decision like
is this

179
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,410
a new Billy was before who wrote it

180
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,799
should be notified senator very detailed
report

181
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,160
and this is getting right information to
the right people

182
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,809
what a sad you look like this is just
again

183
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:56,809
forces break look at the individual
results you know what is it

184
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:00,269
was introduced the code locations

185
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,529
just like a link to our private could
have whatever

186
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:08,249
server take national line for the France
the sack

187
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:12,279
introduced because master we look at the

188
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,470
code as a scene by doesn't love the
right time for

189
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,999
in line everything so you look at the
result of a template shows XSS

190
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:25,100
you can see how that exercise got there
I'll came from

191
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,749
request parameter call XSS for help

192
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:34,129
and we provide documentation how to fix

193
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,949
each individual thing we're talking
about taking a step further and

194
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:40,990
actually like taking your generating

195
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,490
suggested fix for cycle 19 thing were
kinda like

196
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:53,490
could go back to certain people wrong
code snippets probably not and for the

197
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:55,790
super attentive

198
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,599
you notice this bullshit right does say
bullshit this is the way we like

199
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,689
developers tell us

200
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:05,248
air tools wrong you don't provide
feedback cycle

201
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:12,249
just think that with this heavy-handed
organization slapping security

202
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:19,190
services service all said the process

203
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,990
actually like the screen is huge because
you can actually see it hopefully

204
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,350
usually so

205
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,470
this is me create a new branch
pointy-headed

206
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,899
and I'm going to you can see this insert

207
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:43,899
nope in redirect

208
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,660
distrust direct pushed code top right

209
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,509
I got an email said he sent me something
and she's that's not cool

210
00:14:53,509 --> 00:15:00,170
like to hear information about detail
page we saw earlier

211
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,509
okay gonna look oh thats how brakeman
side

212
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:09,389
up okay that last

213
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:16,389
school its problems chain

214
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,990
and this is where the video actually
wisely his next feature

215
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,800
useful but I fix

216
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,150
push the now I can email from Sat

217
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:36,850
everything's cool now you take it a step
further

218
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,320
use what's called heartbreak which

219
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,040
has like 0 traction so space it all
every time save

220
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,290
reanalyzing alert you for fixed

221
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,750
Center so in this case introducing XSS

222
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,490
say treatment

223
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,670
fix it done

224
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,890
that sorta instant feedback cycle

225
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,930
at least for me of

226
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,400
going to fix like moore's another tool

227
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,850
to shift of the week so and gang

228
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,260
is no process which spins up shift on

229
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,569
JS senses which is a headless WebKit
browser

230
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,080
you're seeing activity in the website as
the user would actually see

231
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,570
this is not prepping for each team in
some cases but that's not for

232
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,910
I have been found post the results back

233
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:43,600
said from Sat you can generate like full
disclosure this has been to use of force

234
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,010
it's not a traditional scouts looking
for exercise src

235
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,010
action it's looking for things that
those traditional scanners

236
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:55,780
don't for use traditional to so look for
things like its contents

237
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:01,569
forms posting p anything like that
wasn't really useful

238
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,960
but I'm sorry so then we start

239
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,960
start thinking about stack houses for
chose

240
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,780
six or so of Ruby

241
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,660
we can leverage that archerd suspension

242
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,730
kyle's hipster

243
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,050
I ruby is jobs no guy scholar hipsters

244
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:31,870
anyways jQuery is the same if you put

245
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,929
input internet constructor you are
vulnerable

246
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,620
don't do it this is something defines
houses

247
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,250
certain wanna serves talk about how

248
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,300
scope for stack houses soul much

249
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,220
sorry Scopus tak houses for jobs so much
smaller than everything else

250
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,020
only looking for $1.4 billion really
looking for sings

251
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,490
Tracy so an effort to make

252
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,650
actually useful jobs

253
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,030
sack houses to them which is essentially
just crawler being sucked on all jobs

254
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,639
such assets and analyze those

255
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,650
at that point I'm user visited the page
what were the possibilities for States

256
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,280
assess

257
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,920
and he called a coffee break

258
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,510
just job the snow

259
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,700
secret I think that Twitter's sir
reinvented itself few times

260
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,400
I think this process yourself

261
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,790
incredibly useful you can carry forward
all the knowledge

262
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:41,159
the previous implementation to the new
this little

263
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,250
random here was like the only thing I
could find from my stash

264
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,740
which is attempting language used so
over these three first iterations

265
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,010
settling on mustache I think was a huge
win in itself

266
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,690
mustache doesn't allow these complicated
templates answer

267
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,170
arbitrary code into generates what the
hell

268
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,330
it's very limiting fact can only answer

269
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,520
condition iterate over list

270
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,120
valuerating HTML code putting in place
of choice

271
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,510
this limitation security easy

272
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:18,370
because you can just search so back up a
sec

273
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,760
for inserting a valiant page it's

274
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,270
options double slash which is triple
stash

275
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,080
shows honesty so how final yet assessing
search for

276
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,699
triple stash its I

277
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,230
and then just a little more backgrounds
framers some

278
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,560
upcoming content is built on as you know
this concept files

279
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,250
such if any of these things change you
automatically

280
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,690
added to the review you can see uses for
this putting it in your authentication

281
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,400
system

282
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,590
or anything it's super highly critical
let the security

283
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,620
every time someone tries to change and
again

284
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,929
this is making sure we know about it
before it happens another feature is

285
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,030
what we call to decide

286
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,710
I think a lot of people doing this this
point you know it's a kill switch

287
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:15,200
as you turn off a feature on dog things
for your employees

288
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,340
or you can let rule things out slowly

289
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,080
I think this is becoming like a very
common trend especially like

290
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,360
rolling features out slow percentages

291
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,169
but scary world just sort of things and

292
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,580
so sort of thought about making security

293
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,300
can we take some decisions out the hands
developers

294
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,430
or at least like give them the right
tools to do so

295
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,180
going back to rebirth there's the rails
there's

296
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,020
XP X 21 with the big game with some

297
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,920
style have Famer called costs with

298
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,460
its three Taylor Swift images so

299
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,160
I'm costliest again it's a solid base

300
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,880
framework for building web applications
super like

301
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,240
people are paying attention we noticed
that Swift occurs in both these things

302
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,600
use the same templates for and scholar

303
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,760
which is incredibly useful

304
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,290
but I really miss think about like
ubiquitous secure sure securities

305
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,750
this involves pushing security up and as
far down the chain

306
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,010
you can setting headers

307
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,540
reverse proxy your application and send
response

308
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:40,060
but if you're reverse proxy he can make
sure you have full coverage

309
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,710
again carry for everything you've
learned to your new frameworks

310
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,440
arms are scholar frame took a lot of
things rails like

311
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,600
pretty solid CSRF protection we build
writings were up

312
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,080
Frank and if

313
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,560
providing change the framework is too
invasive possible

314
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,909
always provide libraries to do the exact
same thing

315
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,820
missus cells

316
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,899
so going back to the hotel stash triple
stashed

317
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,340
double stash yes mustache no always

318
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,730
but it still happens things to sneak
people still think they need to do this

319
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,820
don't really need to so we thought about
programmatically

320
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,470
force use strips tasks

321
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,790
so if you want to see it now one triple
stash she sets assess

322
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,080
that's cool at line I'll the file line
number:

323
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,310
to this special file special you have a
file

324
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,470
that securities owner so

325
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,470
introduce a unapproved

326
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,250
triple stash on development it'll just
throw an exception

327
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,720
and production spender absolutely
nothing modified

328
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,150
mustache sway act to always terrified

329
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,190
feature stash was allowed

330
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,210
so that same thing goes for Cesar its
opt out this point

331
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,170
really she s protection cool

332
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,380
filed we watch we have to prove I should
say also

333
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,260
doesn't just I G to review the owners
concept at

334
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,540
you only actually makes it so nobody can
merge

335
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,560
until they've got approval from someone
in

336
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,080
so at this point free hard to get triple
stashing production

337
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,480
same thing goes for redirects big
problem hours before

338
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,270
modified real screamer redirect off-site

339
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,670
again italy has thrown exception or just
not do anything

340
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:42,240
unless you sir whitelist

341
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,200
that's another thing side features a
straight-up

342
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,160
not doing any redirect what's

343
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,610
and these were all the mistakes me

344
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,649
for an hour

345
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,950
talk about something Michael
controversial

346
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,410
sort of going against at least a loss
recommendation

347
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,510
contextual ski if you're free only
provides

348
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,379
one escaping and how do we deal with all
these potentials

349
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,900
putting valid values in the script
context for CSS contacts

350
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,490
we just don't allow allow people to do
that you gonna get exercise

351
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,740
do that so we've made a strong for him
standing

352
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,920
we're not going to get involving actual
skating just not going to do the things

353
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
that

354
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,920
to do that as any sense

355
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,680
thought about setting houses for sale we
don't have it

356
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,700
and to be honest it's probably free low
priority at this point

357
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,020
we look at a few vendor tools we looked
at a few vendor services

358
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,129
and think anyone could really handle too
much

359
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,480
are too well and like I said we haven't
gone into the world

360
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,720
develop ourselves because with all these
provide programmatic

361
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,130
force controls it's kinda hard to
introduce

362
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,970
I'm not saying it's impossible certainly
heart

363
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,900
sorry no further use

364
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,900
Santos is sort of context which is what
I was talking about people don't agree

365
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,750
on the word automation

366
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,990
applying these five batters
automatically makes your application

367
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,890
more secure

368
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,430
that automation I don't get too much

369
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,060
is talk tomorrow talks about browser

370
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,460
features for security magic there's here

371
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,990
you want to talk about one thing I
promise headers are

372
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,050
very interesting topic and a lot of
people think like

373
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,210
0 these headers doing work for me tracer
SecureCode

374
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,660
blah blah blah defense and line control

375
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,700
cetera but I think very unique time

376
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,980
a lot of people agree that it's good to
find these things

377
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,200
for not to talk about just yes which
answers

378
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,410
communications all cell wall

379
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,420
your of sizing like texas los lunes
product as

380
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,810
like that position a round-trip redirect
so

381
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:14,270
it's a good time to serve push for these
headers organization

382
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,950
on time contents policy specifically
this is serb in my life

383
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,340
for the past six months and probably
teen

384
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,879
life another six months have very strong
opinions about this tonight

385
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,060
talk about it a lot so much so that
creates a separate accounts are on

386
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,870
issues keep happens to be there

387
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,280
senators costly flooding my followers

388
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,590
which I'm still amazed

389
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,169
so I'm gonna save that content security
policies reshaping security

390
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,780
also use a

391
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,889
is why the there's a very complicated
spec

392
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,530
there's no doubt this is the most
complicated ever seen

393
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,649
they used to be differences across
browsers recent Firefox

394
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,630
lease just on they support the standard
for

395
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,590
not widely adopted I think they recorded
their study only like

396
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,050
50 out of a thousand sites fight scary

397
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,320
I did my own study up the sites that
didn't sound that more than half the

398
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,760
morning

399
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:23,340
validators anyways so just further

400
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,590
again however it completely eliminates
stuff like this store

401
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:32,020
XSS another variable state

402
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,190
answers ex-cons

403
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,240
to accept archery each from users

404
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,680
which is like the number one thing you
should never do

405
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,870
explain how all this for

406
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:50,550
actually fines but Co got a couple times
where reports from sees

407
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,510
strike connect host undefined what could
that possibly be

408
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,050
JavaScript saw

409
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,310
thinks he can do

410
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,250
this is %ah example have seized action

411
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,040
I have an inline script tak says like

412
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,120
if this council of actually happens
potentially cross-site scripting

413
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,149
page conceited some

414
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:22,550
back uses p to disable online jobs

415
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,399
back refresh and says refused

416
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,940
if you see is people sick is not allow
things to happen violations trick

417
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,220
violation can you just send report
working actually stop the action

418
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,630
so how would the president knowingly
house knowing

419
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,760
script dollar block jobs to was inserted
applications expected

420
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,020
or was inserted no way for the browser
to tell

421
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,240
this is like server-side

422
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,280
so what is in my jobs

423
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,899
this is all the examples on Flickr thats
Johnston Colin

424
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,240
Johnston your eyes mines most basic
example

425
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,250
but also placed can also striptease even

426
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,390
which is calling you now concept I'm

427
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,950
you function string object

428
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,470
same thing goes for inline styles styles

429
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,490
to go back to the example i said im
never to do

430
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,420
top ever do this don't ever put for song

431
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,940
bloodstains at people later will too
hardcore about this

432
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,360
so thats the first ones example dynamic
data in your script context

433
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,459
same for the NEX to last line

434
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,380
is mines

435
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,870
code does not people data do not do
those things

436
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,678
this is a very curious still

437
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,890
way to think about it I won't back down
from this

438
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,610
peoples were saying this has been
impossible just feasible

439
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,000
but I don't think so and of course
remember that every time

440
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,429
right my job script god kills a kitten
miss one

441
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:09,050
this specifically is gone its role quite
a bit

442
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,080
we're so so its

443
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,310
we stand behind CSP so much that it's
not hard show

444
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,010
in the NHL we say never right inline
javascript

445
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,480
right in line styles because we know if
I see is key policy

446
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,140
model out ski policies done

447
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,070
but CSP is not true she's his heart

448
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,950
seized is also Haas this web sites that
help you right

449
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:43,480
others extensions will learn what you
see is people's should

450
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,160
or if you're like super panel you can
build your own policies for

451
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,179
she also provide libraries to help my
sis

452
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,910
stay longer and string of course it does
having be able to break down into chunks

453
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,880
seems like he's I saw your own secure
headers damn

454
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,970
controlled a lot it's the worst thing
for product ever

455
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,870
but it does this lie to supply basically

456
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,580
configuration

457
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,480
generates missus browser where so

458
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,850
defies the right for the right price or
it might not play any

459
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:24,389
cases on helmet is for note

460
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,530
and I was talking with fear home he's
going to have the same

461
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:32,090
president action conditional application
stuff and tell me

462
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,678
headlines was just released not too long
ago

463
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,810
it doesn't serve have the smarts does
have the concept that we can see

464
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,610
file dictates what your haters will be

465
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,870
and then week ported secure headers just
follow

466
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,870
this is coming out soon hopefully

467
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,229
interview

468
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,980
and during happy iro this little tool

469
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,900
we haven't actually anything happens for
these

470
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,460
I'll to me useful for other people it's
basically just a note server

471
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,190
accept requests also contains a lot of
help for libraries

472
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,100
can use in the front as well the

473
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,169
libraries is this had about first place
watching validate the grammar

474
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:25,610
your halls was as hell me

475
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,629
given a header policy you'll say like oh
you're allowing

476
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,040
JavaScript you're allowed you can load

477
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,379
image over any sticky house things

478
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,240
might not realize you've said

479
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,220
and of course I just wanna get this
thing out already but also explain what

480
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,100
day sees report it's coming in probably

481
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,158
this is a little difficult most changed
parties

482
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,390
I stand by this is also something keep
this

483
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,560
I still think that a fine writer is
worth it

484
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,710
people said there's a lot of bugs all
stations

485
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,730
Firefox using

486
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,909
no disrespect anyone that says that I
think they were doing it right

487
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:13,190
personal for Firefox 23 front 5

488
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,240
you can slide scanner header name and
standard format it's almost

489
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,520
is but Firefox

490
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,090
before versus 23 you have this the
custom for the original implementation

491
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:30,139
Firefox from lesson 25 and Safari 6

492
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,730
send the standard but with a different

493
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:36,960
and for I I E Safari less than six

494
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,480
law you don't spy 100 of specifically
don't supply header for Safari 5

495
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,870
this if you do no matter what the
contents block

496
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,149
report only mode intently page

497
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:52,469
this is true for mobile to stop

498
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,530
from not you

499
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,110
so here's all the rules need to
implement special writer for the rights

500
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:07,110
user this logic like a says 30 for
libraries

501
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,290
was this man is look like I

502
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,630
counted six differences between these
two headers the top is sort of the

503
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,600
original

504
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,940
chrome on the bottom one is a Firefox 1
there's probably more than 60

505
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,800
try very hard but this madness is just
not us

506
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,120
and needed to adopt really loud

507
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,839
I I want to serve get on a soapbox for
second talk about feature CSP

508
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,840
11 I feel very strongly about as well

509
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,050
there's a concept of a script answer
scripts

510
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,940
this is for what about can

511
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,740
their actually real use cases other than
just performance for you cannot

512
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:53,379
jobs babies have a legacy application

513
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,500
all my god JavaScript you can actually
five years

514
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,730
two techniques to weightless specific in
mind blocks

515
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,540
nonce as most announces

516
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,630
supplier and a value into the header
applied

517
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,030
natural each script tag I

518
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,570
think that's the absolute wrong way to
approach it because

519
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,900
I mean all you say releasing Prakash
with a any

520
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,550
for you you cannot pass the contents
block

521
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,040
hashing has a lot of benefits

522
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,770
basics hashed allies inside skip

523
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,730
me for that house value header not
introducing at review

524
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,030
these values computed on deploy time

525
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,800
it's just really a lot of benefits

526
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,350
lost talk to me more about this more
people like on my side

527
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,900
agree

528
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,240
as I certainly to foresees has report
only mode

529
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,430
this means thanks website so be it look
like the reports it generates

530
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,870
is very valuable information reports doc

531
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,240
right where it is violation occur Buy
Lead Director

532
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,140
what happened effective directive
actually

533
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,140
so in this report it was a case of day

534
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,690
local host thousand homes track to

535
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,050
internal instanceof life but it was not
a la vez

536
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:25,600
policy probably should have been but
just an example

537
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,700
10 season for tell you and I put
anonymously because

538
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,770
not restrict any identifying information
from these reports

539
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,660
johnnie cookies get sent along which
means you can't respect user

540
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,200
we don't wanna garbage one dysentery

541
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,230
noms privacy is big thing and CSP

542
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:50,100
first chef hopped into sending support
in the first place

543
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,310
I don't wanna send by the fall we take
this very seriously

544
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,570
wait so you a lot of nonsense

545
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,640
prolly have two reports yet we just
throw

546
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,750
because there's not enough information
useful

547
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,710
or just indicates this is browser plugin
this is not compatible sees p

548
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,020
unfortunately this is not fixed is

549
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,630
getting back show the to get have guys
will tell you about

550
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,830
bro their markets and all plugins

551
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:25,080
it's not a good thing

552
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,630
detecting ex-cons release document your
eyes HTTPS whatever

553
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:36,130
and the block your eyes she ex-cons

554
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,730
authorize resource like sayers your
application it's hose and also answer

555
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,070
serving up a bunch porn pictures from
Russia something

556
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:49,630
you'd be able to tell from CST not
authorize opposed to serve

557
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,440
companies have class pass and saw a
LastPass

558
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,700
is just not compatible with the streets
these people see

559
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,120
is probably the sources maybe half a bar

560
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,830
violations

561
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,970
missus mission 12 found a lot of people
seen cont

562
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,189
ran web sites in Russia doc

563
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,460
dollars which clearly you're violating
all

564
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:22,440
this post people asking specifically

565
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,260
tips on analyzing reports one thing I
would say is like focus on one side

566
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,650
focus on one violation

567
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,430
for violation type time if you've got
ten times more

568
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,569
style source violations image source:
you probably want to look at world

569
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:45,180
styles or so coming from I look for
patterns

570
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,440
results it's pretty easy to identify
systematic

571
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:55,160
bugs or issues going back to the root
causes sir

572
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,020
good circus these things categories set
up like some kinda cáceres

573
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,560
are you sir the lay of the land filter
out the noise if you can

574
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,859
los pases filter out special Firefox

575
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:13,080
I should have said that Firefox sends

576
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,180
script sample if you violate my
javascript she send you like the first

577
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,819
and bites

578
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,260
the I'll skip to try to execute so

579
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,490
if you search my last pass immediately
those

580
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,709
or what's commonly more approach just or
grounds we find something

581
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:33,119
I wouldn't say that my she's organized

582
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,869
clearly this is something that should
monitor and

583
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:42,400
overtime we personal

584
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,530
remain a blog post recently sees values
were

585
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,070
on hit-and-run blurred out much use

586
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:55,510
protecting and then of course you get

587
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:02,510
to analyze these reports sample

588
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,848
of course more

589
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:09,270
to visualize if you take away the pic

590
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,420
which is no longer there today things a
lot nicer

591
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,710
Nissar group on what's going on this is
%uh

592
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,540
by stripping on the script sample and if
anyone recognizes that topped one

593
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,710
which is Google Analytics which is like
generally

594
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,430
his mines restrictions for start because
Google Analytics on

595
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,779
every page let me just tell you to copy
and paste right into side

596
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,790
it's really easy to fix by doing so you
can reduce

597
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,089
reports 1184 these

598
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:44,970
have a way to monitor progress

599
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,279
built up a stupid simple goes out hurled

600
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,380
these hoes sources others are coming
back another

601
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,510
good place for people just take a look
at the status quo things we do you serve

602
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,349
a little more

603
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:00,710
smart so yes you recall she had started

604
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,040
smiley faces yellow sorry this whole
thing

605
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,310
what's its this is

606
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:13,180
contents K policy report only mode this
content security policy enforcement

607
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,830
prolly just yes

608
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,900
so if you few

609
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,460
go over each one explain why it's yellow
because it allows him on JavaScript

610
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,630
we consider yellow because you should
allowing JavaScript retrofitting

611
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,420
applications

612
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,619
not always true so we get people
sometimes any help

613
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:40,390
months before the so

614
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,490
will soldier on the other headers

615
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,470
but if I just saw it on C St hopefully
like see any reason not

616
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:50,740
very powerful sported pretty

617
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,129
who dis and if you go back to my
dramatic statements

618
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:02,130
you can get rid of excess forget so

619
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,380
certain other random ish is it generally
fall into the category

620
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,369
things going back to TC order

621
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:14,250
you're required to review any code that
affects public APIs

622
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,550
we still have a soldier script

623
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:21,810
month missiles crap obviously not good

624
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:26,000
so now we have pagers go to 0

625
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,500
this thing East review ship kron job

626
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,750
was like every four hours or so

627
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,800
checks see like oh someone actually some
code

628
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,119
security has a review yet media like
right away

629
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,460
and again this is just

630
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,950
running a manuscript in a month and
again just more random things were going

631
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,259
in my piece of people

632
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,580
we have threats

633
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,020
Dec web 3.0 Cyber Intelligence ice three
months turns America

634
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,580
always TweetDeck set up with like a
different columns are looking for things

635
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,759
might indicate Twitter's intro

636
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,660
icy spots just looks use a dangerous
functions is not static analysis is

637
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,740
Rep so things like that in HTML

638
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,618
things like that not a good enough tool
to automate

639
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:21,900
you serve because the results are so low
noise

640
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,890
just because you use the dangers
functions dangers way

641
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,740
nosing hurler every time had a good at
it too

642
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,779
page removed notified

643
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,290
some fries CSP

644
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,580
just seem to forget stands for as a tool
used to search

645
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,190
repositories for past this is mostly
useful from the open source things and

646
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,300
people like me

647
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,960
these passwords history somewhere

648
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,190
actually instead of this now squash all

649
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,960
isn't one thing before we open source
but it's also useful here

650
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,220
we take a policy password should not be
any any application

651
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,020
this makes it easy to find

652
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,990
so that sworn you sir leaving dump a
list

653
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,209
Twitter accounts like I think people
should follow at least if they're

654
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,700
interested in things like brakeman in
CSP

655
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,020
sad I'm the person behind

656
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,359
all these alternate personalities
suffered security

657
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,970
definitely CSP all barth

658
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:33,500
Hill you know they're definitely some
the best

659
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,280
seized at

660
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,690
questions

661
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,010
I we want it to be but it's so low
priority

662
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,160
really likely

663
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,379
there's a commercial product that
provides the exact same functionality

664
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,630
tells

665
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:06,630
offline

666
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:12,259
final series sources at the same time
it's it's a pretty

667
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,020
dead simple just

668
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:23,020
basically

669
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,930
outlaw I mean I can see everything we do
is good for everyone

670
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:47,120
but I think if you have the start out
with them and are you a top

671
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,310
tell you any point eventually you get to
the point using

672
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:57,310
actual escaping

673
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:07,750
pretty much there's a few cases where
you have to take the

674
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:13,100
stance Cody data instead of like
plotting a value into a javascript

675
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:13,710
variable

676
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,230
as an attribute to hidden div somewhere

677
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,580
industry jobs complex objects like

678
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,630
hash or jobs calls

679
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:30,250
associative arrays maps whatever you
want to call them sometimes like 15

680
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,590
configuration page the way we do that

681
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,030
inside script application she saw

682
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,970
type application Jason doesn't execute
if you try

683
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:46,480
we a shemale that again XQ taxes much
garbage

684
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,230
but then if you ve contents that script

685
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:55,100
and parsley chase on now you pop
JavaScript object with all the complex

686
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,580
settings

687
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:02,580
instead of calling so far X people
something to chase on or an onclick

688
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,230
event

689
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:15,230
or anything ha

690
00:47:18,729 --> 00:47:21,718
exact party NHL

691
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:28,719
don't put dynamic script or style
contacts

692
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,040
absolutely

693
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,860
going back to the the time convergence
thing we have enough purists and a

694
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,610
javascript does not belong

695
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,360
HTML files so mean you have to like you
know

696
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,350
focus on them we just have a
company-wide no one loves company wide

697
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:49,799
email

698
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,160
title was moratorium on inline
javascript

699
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,040
we got like two people saying all and
and 150 people saying

700
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,930
thank I don't know if that's

701
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:07,359
comment every other organizations
definitely was

702
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,900
and just yet we only use one type

703
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,300
encoding DC nines to every single
framework

704
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:22,300
ever hopefully now now

705
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:30,430
house outside thanks
