1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,289
at like to the points and have VM's
within that applies now go uses real

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,560
links they can go grab

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,870
your real web pages you could go get Rio
call backs election stuff it's possible

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,910
I see it a little bit more intelligence
have

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,609
you things you artifacts recovered the
field or artifacts that you may be

6
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,220
captured for other places

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,599
so I guess

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,359
your idea kinda data that we're going to
give you sort out the bad service ever

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,369
well that's what up here

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,470
we're going to be the peak caps that
occurred both

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,949
on the wire and within our VM networking
infrastructure

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,910
to get to see the difference of the two
I get to see what what kills her friend

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,690
transfer over the water and everything
like that

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,290
you also give you the original objects
themselves

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,660
that the Lord is easily worry but that
archive object less

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,099
will contain everything that was part of
the original setup flows if you want or

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,379
your reconstitute the attack your own
friends ex you have all the information

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,300
you need

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,300
we'll also give you all the infection
URL's

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,690
so if we look at this big long list here
that was sensual lived in our proxy

21
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,879
server that allowed us to rebuild the
attack and the one in

22
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,950
all is the one that contain the actual
exploit everything else is just a

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,150
separate are you can see your txt is for
example

24
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,479
those obviously called and post exploit
so we have all either a less change

25
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:20,729
details that we will display as well so
if you've ever play with the damn canals

26
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:21,600
a system which I'm

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,100
assuming we'll see probably very similar
to put

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,380
will also highlight some things though
because he's a little more sis alerts in

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,460
light blue that's kinda bus adding some
color

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,240
for those are familiar with higher
interest in data but some key things

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,630
that we can do here

32
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,399
is like for deals for example we tie
with entry points are

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,780
and thats because we run things in
context people

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,030
how that data right so were able to load
things or

35
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,970
say on encrypt an increase in the xy
because we have to explore the could do

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,710
that for us

37
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,210
work to try to take the law by itself
assuming is on crafted

38
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:01,270
you have difficulty their lifetimes his
other examples is the

39
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,229
recent PF your day around January the
game early February

40
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:10,848
memory serves as well be found in the
infield live the one example while years

41
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:11,540
ago Sisley

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,989
for 15,000 seconds I'm so we can do
things like track that as well as

43
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:19,690
potentially tricked into thinking that
much time has passed

44
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,750
with you forced a few things like that
as well other things you might be able

45
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,879
to flag on our kids and debugger track

46
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,290
if it tries to figure out in a virtual
machines are all behaviors that we can

47
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,000
flag on hand or avoid so we can do
what's up

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,980
if people over to the mass

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,660
we still get your pee caps get your
original objects

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,420
but because we're not performance found
on that platform we can give you some

51
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,679
additional things you can

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,090
optionally turn on so the first to be
your extract the files

53
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,050
so we can take a snapshot the file
system on rpm before we start

54
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,840
go to work or before we start the run
and then we can take that difference of

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,489
what it was like

56
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,300
afterwards and provide it to you so you
have access to all the files changed

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,599
during that run within that archive

58
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,470
you can also turn on our process memory
dump so any process that

59
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,170
don't miss altered during the run it
never will be down to be included in

60
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,859
that archive

61
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,980
if you enable that feature you can also
turn on a flash movie clip

62
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,569
so if you want to look at the desk top
of the machine maybe

63
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,890
the bag I forgot to include a library in
C that sometimes are you get their

64
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,170
message that it couldn't find it was
looking for low

65
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,569
those useful the other year they would
use a clip for the support AutoIt

66
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:35,679
from auto is like a user automation
scripting language it's pretty simple

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,440
straightforward

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,750
we support on the products if you want
that say analyzing the exterior PDF or

69
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,610
something with some specific behaviors

70
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,140
you can program that and then

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,980
that clip is useful to help you build
that workflow because you get to see the

72
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,879
window names and

73
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:56,310
and what's waiting for like a style you
will get the same extracted call back

74
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,780
information here the only difference in
masses that might be real

75
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,530
call the confirmation if you were in
live mode so whereas if I'm in sandbox

76
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,209
on the one the other platforms are
probably getting error 404 something

77
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:05,580
back

78
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,780
on on trial with the requests here

79
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,409
I found in live mode I should get the
real response which which could be

80
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:12,239
interesting as well

81
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,000
and that's similar to the other part to
get the full dynamic else information

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,100
additionally on the other price you only
get that anything else information for

83
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,250
things that are malicious

84
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,550
on this far I can get a matter what
it'll tell you whether or not we would

85
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,660
have quit phosphide about our other
products

86
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,280
through the fly would set but you're
gonna get that that information either

87
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,138
way

88
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,080
you a quick snap rob what the deployment
looks like it's pretty straightforward

89
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,979
there's not

90
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,050
a lot of configuration on these
appliances

91
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,160
generally it's gonna take you longer to
rack and cable up

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,250
think physically that is to get going
I'm me

93
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,880
walk through the 13th step wizard and
you're done it's very straightforward

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,090
so worried too that we deploy is pre
Nats we want to make sure we get your

95
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,599
original source IP is

96
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,620
and over with high above the network
where that condition exists

97
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,810
which typically will be either of the
insider face a firewall

98
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,699
or of the client facing interface a
proxy server you want those

99
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,020
for your for email product we just want
to sit after the first cut

100
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,930
anti-spam and CATV other than that we
don't care we can support BCC is well so

101
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,960
we don't wanna go in line with the mail
flow

102
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,530
you can send us a a global blind carbon
copy of want the upstream MTA's

103
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,179
and that and a ban wave installing that
part same thing for web if you want to

104
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,070
add up and you can do

105
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,699
span work you don't have to be in line
and that our last Provident

106
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,050
really talk about is conceptually it's
very similar mass

107
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,199
is our file park to it melts file shares
and watch them for changes and analyzes

108
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,229
the files in their share

109
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,139
as the change

110
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,139
was close with this um won the great
things about all the data that we have

111
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,070
is that we're able to leverage it with
lots of different technology so it's not

112
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,000
just us fine things we can take that

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,449
turnaround and then make other products
network a little bit smarter

114
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,530
right so I can take a lot of our data
like say I have a huge OS change summary

115
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,818
is also to your house and i cant force
those out and put in blocking rules or

116
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,740
something like that go

117
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,220
for example I so we can take a lot of
our intelligence to then make these

118
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,150
other devices

119
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,630
in force walking action or log something
more heavily

120
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,639
whatever it may be our date is very
viable for that purpose

121
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,729
and therefore same as an is a natural
fit so had

122
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,150
really great success there's 15 min once

123
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,219
at that's about it if you have any
questions will be out at the booth over

124
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,139
there

125
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,380
but have a good show up
