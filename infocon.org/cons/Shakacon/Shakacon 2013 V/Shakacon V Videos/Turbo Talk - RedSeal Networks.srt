okay both they both get to speak

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,329
its and our friend from a calf is wrong
I do have the solution to everything

6
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,390
right here so we can talk about that
really I don't know

7
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,500
a okay

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,800
her names Katniss is Corbin

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,309
we had glad to be here as always

10
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,140
Hawaiian friends and we had

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,449
we're actually a consulting company that
focuses on finding emerging technologies

12
00:00:58,449 --> 00:00:58,910
written by

13
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,230
really smart engineers figured out how
to automate impossible or seeming

14
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:02,828
impossible

15
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,170
and we heavy historia

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,220
bringing that solutions proven emerging
solutions

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,189
to market at some very large companies
and and infrastructures within their

18
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,529
you act I have we've got to experience
even though we look freakishly long

19
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,670
young so don't underestimate us a

20
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,130
we what are the things you want to talk
to is that we have our partnership here

21
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,740
today with right still networks

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,399
you know I faces there already but and
we talk about their love it

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,579
a but one of the things we also came out
to

24
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:37,689
way to talk about is one of our new
relationships with see pay

25
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:41,408
and how that basically takes out or
reduces the

26
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:45,930
PCI scope exponentially I wanted the
clients that we worked with

27
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,479
with C payne et was at gift finder that
and we were able to reduce their PCI SCA

28
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,380
level from one to an essay from 40
million euros

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,829
a year just by reducing the scope cell
you know maybe it's not the panacea but

30
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,719
its of a close

31
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,559
your at their I'm too many

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,940
program percent I I

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,069
to basically went to

34
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:17,970
this this is hacer we i didnt soco I am
our body tired from red seals on

35
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,840
Hawaiian time

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,430
so we expect him in about an hour but
your spice to this process out we put

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,160
this together

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,859
in like six minutes for just me one
second and

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,000
so basically a little bit about CPK on

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
CP link was started by accompany

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,769
who has brought out to data bank to
reduce fraud there are a lot of

42
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:38,099
financial companies to do

43
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,018
here today banks I'm so you know what it
feels like when fraud hits

44
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,280
when credit cards have to be reissued it
seems like no big deal

45
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,099
but it's extremely costly I'm anybody's
doing any kind

46
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,379
online e-commerce I'll you know shipping

47
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,370
internet fees all that stuff is really
high so on

48
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,810
the creators have being I'm a good girl
he knows that but

49
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,310
we work with it on the greatest being
actually were brought in cuz they're big

50
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,280
skill set is business process
optimization

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,760
and big data analytics they were able to
com into Georgia bank and reduce fraud

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,399
by 25 percent now how they get paid is
that they get to participate in the

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,159
profit

54
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,950
sharing for our cost savings and so you
can imagine

55
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,200
way to bank the world's largest
financial institution 25 percent

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,849
a that was pretty good money so partly
how they were also paid

57
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,950
was by being introduced to ninety two
other I'm

58
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,940
banking institutions and that's where
this particular solution started

59
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,989
so what CP link does as it actually
creates direct

60
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,549
connections to this is such an
interesting place to start

61
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:51,530
just gotta tell I but it does it creates
a direct banking relationships with

62
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,239
merchants

63
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,909
for at merchant payment providers where
markets are takes up the middle man is

64
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,400
basically what it does is it creates

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,379
direct banking connections and at the
point at which that credit card or

66
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,679
mobile payments or whatever is takin
actually talking is this

67
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,239
the data so that reduces your pan
network your credit card

68
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,680
data and integrated into the ERP system
so that does a lot of different things

69
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,750
if there's any financial people here

70
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,820
for anyone who's ever had to do
reconciliation for

71
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,750
any kind of mobile ur credit card
payments the March payment providers

72
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,340
count

73
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,090
I'm you not doing that well or often and
so what

74
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,530
the first thing we do is we actually
come in and do in audits and we have

75
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,299
found

76
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,840
we did at University and California

77
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,250
and we just took a look at the kinds of
fees they were paying you know

78
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,630
card not present non PCI compliant and
by the way

79
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,320
to will become PCI compliant because we
want to reduce our fees

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,430
nobody ever gets reduced fees but that's
why we're all running around like

81
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,220
chickens with their heads cut off right

82
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,490
forgetting about actual security and
just doing compliance checks but when

83
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,759
you actually look

84
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,060
at what you're paying with your company
is paying because you're still getting

85
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,130
gouged for

86
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,250
PCI non-compliant so enjoy the audits

87
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,530
but they're not quite panned out just
yet just died

88
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,750
I'm and then if you get a breach of
course those things are ridiculously

89
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,870
expensive but we

90
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,400
turned upside I anyway we did a and
audits

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,929
up this university just six months with
the transactions and found that they

92
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,720
thought they were

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,340
on paying like two percent and they were
paying 13 percent and every transaction

94
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,080
it actually cost them ten cents every
time somebody made

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm a copy at that she so it was

96
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,210
is interesting because it was almost
like i money shredder not a printer

97
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,810
was like that assists a what they're
going for their

98
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,460
with printing so I and charging for
printing

99
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,909
so if you can cheaper for the university
to actually do printing for free

100
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,000
so I anyway so what we do is

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,490
our first app is becoming a week we take
a look at what you're currently paying

102
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,569
and then we go out and barter 4

103
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:59,720
you and create that and get actually
direct banking relationships

104
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,729
and then we put in the secure gateway
which is actually

105
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,030
it is PCI it is literally attacked
constantly

106
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,479
I've and it is compliant and then of
course you guys don't have any credit

107
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,669
card debt

108
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,799
internetwork anymore moving forward so
we would use that scope is kinda like

109
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,100
stopping the bleeding

110
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,210
well enhancing business and is the first
technology

111
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,409
part like as somebody who comes in to
bring solutions to people

112
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,319
I actually don't have to ask for money
like maybe four thousand to ten thousand

113
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,750
dollars to put in

114
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,759
and the rest is just you know so I'm
like he can I reduce your PC I footprint

115
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,120
your cost of doing business give you
more profit

116
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,240
no-fat you like six is a cooler today
you know event that's literally

117
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,750
the conversations we had cell it sound
it's actually kinda fun and for me i my

118
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,060
security purist

119
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,500
so the compliance running around like is
really frustrating cuz I actually like

120
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,919
to protect things that matter

121
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,198
but it doesn't seem like you know
spending over time

122
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,889
just making sure that somebody can see a
credit card that's probably already been

123
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,560
compromised is a good use of time

124
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,090
cell for me I like it because then I can
focus on actually protecting the things

125
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,989
that matter

126
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,630
so I'm with that's that's actually why
we partnered with

127
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,490
right CL because once you take advantage

128
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,900
a not having credit card data in your
network anymore

129
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,849
I'm we have to clean it up and so what
red seal does

130
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,250
is it actually does a network map by
taking an

131
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,639
I love your layer 3 devices and nearing
thats with your on ability data

132
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,139
which gives you the ability to see in
real time and in constant monitoring

133
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,870
way your network infrastructure looks
like show

134
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,449
there's a case study done by Cisco I'm
Cisco who owns obviously a lot of layer

135
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,539
3 devices

136
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,419
and when they first imported olive their
ACLs

137
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,840
from there they are three devices this
is what it looked like

138
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,280
so for the rest if you have a network
map that something like this right it's

139
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,210
either gonna look like this earth could
have the big fluffy cloud with the big

140
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,229
fire while

141
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,729
you like here's my vizio that's my
network you know it's like for

142
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,030
you got the governor's so wouldn't

143
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,359
so basically I work redfield eyes is it
allows you to start cleaning up

144
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,810
putting things in zones and whatnot so
you'll notice to the other nice thing

145
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,550
about

146
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,970
this Sat Cisco bug splats is what they
call that

147
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,129
is they've got all these really fun
snowflake evenings

148
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,410
the Quiznos who do they belong to I'm
sure you don't have

149
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,229
any networks are any devices that you're
unaware but if you were

150
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:28,030
we could help you find a home for them
so I'm

151
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,520
obviously and you know with the kinda
turnover and

152
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,610
and lacquer people available I'm keeping
up today

153
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,130
and you know and it's like business as
always thank you open that hole any that

154
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,429
web server up in

155
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,689
hey we have a new business partner and
and my favorite

156
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,070
you just acquired a company and we gotta
give the keys to the house you have no

157
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,060
idea

158
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,510
who they'd been within who they gave the
keys to you in

159
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,170
you know what their behavior was before
but no he come on and you know

160
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,490
during the family so it's a way for you
to even see

161
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,910
prior to them coming and you can and for
them in a safe

162
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,730
and concise fashion so back to this
weird bug splat

163
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,589
I thank you a so the bug splat to
basically

164
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,990
the different things you can there's
some actual really cute pictures

165
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,000
add at the table this was a case study
offenders they like to use the same

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,910
things over and over

167
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,589
again and then they know the stories
really well but I forget sometimes

168
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:24,910
I'm anyway so these are the network
segment so this wasn't

169
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,730
interesting thing that a Cisco found out
about themselves

170
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,630
there was one rule set permission see
that one

171
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,459
Erica there is on there was one
particular rules that

172
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,439
that they thought okay so you got you
know these were their business partners

173
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,410
right

174
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,490
and they thought that they were all
segregated from their network

175
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,070
well when so one of the things that red
cell does is it actually

176
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,380
am you know just like that back to see
you know default passwords and all that

177
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,029
other stuff

178
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,040
but the other thing it does is it shows
he by the way

179
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,459
this one rule that buried in all this
line code

180
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:02,290
has actually allowed and I think it was
like a to remember what that

181
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,439
permission Mina a way Taberna

182
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,290
I'm the basically by one rule sets that
was on all those firewalls

183
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,050
guarding their network allowed all their
business partners

184
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,399
into their network so and that was
something you know

185
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,279
they would not have known what some had
automation so that was kinda fun clearly

186
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,470
they've cleaned it up

187
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,820
or they wouldn't have I'm allowed us to
know that at this juncture

188
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,339
but there's the SEC ISO actually I

189
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,390
if your YouTube Red Sea on Cisco he
likes to go through

190
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,550
all about and I it's actually it's a
pretty fascinating thing

191
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,140
there a wonderful referral partner for
them as well

192
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,180
so out the way I O we've had this
discussion right the BIA

193
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,609
BYOD deployment everybody's feeling that
in everybody's bring into three devices

194
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,760
per individual

195
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,589
your campus it's like gaining in there
phone in the smartphone in that computer

196
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,110
and all that so

197
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,329
that's a big one I we were talking about

198
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:05,290
with that you know the looking for a
picture here hold on one second

199
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,099
I'm okay I wanna do the ingress and
egress but we don't seem to have it here

200
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,240
okay let me show you

201
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,490
this doesn't have the pretty boxes that
I was looking for but there's

202
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,240
once you can actually map sorry gonna
give you guys

203
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,690
say can drive in it to make you dizzy
I'm

204
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,760
went to map out your on

205
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,310
your infrastructure here doesn't have
the one that we have out there

206
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,319
I'm you can start asking Ahmad Al

207
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,510
area a lot of really interesting
questions so

208
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,480
the other thing you can start doing is
creating these sounds and so you can say

209
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,700
if anything changes in this down if any
permission changes in this town

210
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,490
show me right away what made it
non-compliant so you can actually start

211
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,769
segregating

212
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:57,360
visually olive that in with PCI their
real this next version coming out

213
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,740
they're gonna be really hot and heavy
about you guys knowing exactly

214
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,139
you know Watson compliant what's not and
how it got and/or stay that way

215
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,230
so and that's a big one if you guys come
to the booth I'll show you a little bit

216
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,279
more about that compliance States

217
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,930
which is pretty nice it's it's a nice
rolling snapshot

218
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,430
and I it was kinda next time

219
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,479
I am

220
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,660
outsource networks if any guys are doing
any cum managing

221
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,750
I'm sometimes you basically just hand
off to AT&T year

222
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,920
HP hi thanks I'm you know

223
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,839
I want to make this change in the
network this is actually a tool that you

224
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,750
can use for virtual pen testing

225
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,649
to you can say okay if we make this
change what phone abilities are open and

226
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:42,540
what needs to be changed for switch

227
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,120
network on abilities are actually the
probable and you can do

228
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,209
I'm you can ask questions like what is
the

229
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,388
on for i'm looking for. the thing that
actually

230
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,040
shows that I have next time

231
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,680
next time we'll know he's gonna be late
I'm so this thing here is kinda fun so

232
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,329
this

233
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:03,550
these are like compromise host right so
it's basically showing you

234
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,019
here's your network it's basically
showing you that I'm me this map assets

235
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:12,540
are the probable vulnerabilities and
from there we can simulate

236
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,269
what it can get you into the network all
the way in 30 DNC

237
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:20,180
so you can even do like if then
statements and just find out like

238
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,388
it you know how bad is this allowing get

239
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,589
gonna work for us or how bad is that can
affect us all but do we you know we

240
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,769
don't say no to the businesses cuz ima
get mad at us all the time

241
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,660
so now it's like no or its yes but not
yet

242
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,870
yes will allow that change to happen but
first we need to fix these bad things

243
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,829
you know the other nice thing about that
if you have any antiquated software

244
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:41,219
running

245
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,350
old versions apps windows or what have
you or even your

246
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,720
were calling your SAP aP's on you want
to catch those with every latest and

247
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,209
greatest patch his chances are it's
gonna take the thing down

248
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,149
so the nice thing is is that even though
there's gonna billy's might be showing

249
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,760
up time and time again

250
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,389
you can show visually that you're
competent controls are actually working

251
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:03,779
you can see him up yeah I know it's
kinda on ability but look it's behind

252
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:04,269
here

253
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,279
in nothing can touch it nothing can
thinkin

254
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,959
take advantage up that on ability
because it behind these firewalls

255
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,010
and now there's no access inbound or
outbound on

256
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:18,100
you can ask you questions like what is
the access to this asset from

257
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,779
the Internet to the Internet from this
to that

258
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,600
there's a really nice kinda quick and
easy slide here at the and

259
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,110
so this thing is interesting cuz you
know from the untrusted network

260
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,019
there are 31 host that are the probable
and behind that

261
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,660
is a 110 host they could be affected by
it right and then you got 31 host

262
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,860
that are completely protected and so
this is that it allows you to drill down

263
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,470
into our

264
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,750
that sell whether you have you know PCI
higher federally regulated industries

265
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,949
or anything like that it allows you to
actually in real time not have to rely

266
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:51,359
on tribal knowledge

267
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,010
to understand your network and it's not
like the latest Vizio thats

268
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,829
I have saying the second you hand it to
somebody or get it off the printer

269
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,439
I'm this is actually constant monitoring
she just creates

270
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,560
a service accounts goes out grab the
configs every day

271
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,439
to have somebody made a change we were
sleeping and

272
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,560
and puts that in with the latest on
abilities can you have Sao

273
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,560
that cannot show you go on for a long
time and

274
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,638
it does do a it's better to 1.2 report
for you so you can get free audit which

275
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,310
is kinda nice

276
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,550
is the one point you can be kinda
challenge to fill out and that's a can

277
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,699
report

278
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,899
it does rely on new standards and risk
modeling to

279
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,199
to actually determine it so it's not
just the information from the vendors

280
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,008
actually a lot more lot of outside
information that shows you what's

281
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:37,500
getting

282
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,670
are what's really at risk and why so
lots of different ways to us

283
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,939
you know to get into the weeds on this
so if you have any more questions

284
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,149
coming yes in the back where the ones
with the monkeys K

285
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,269
you any questions now thank you
