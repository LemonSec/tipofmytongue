but anyway I spend about ten years

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,350

00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,690
I joining us to care much for years ago
and I'm based in the AFC

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,660
your response that Saint Paul that used
to be the tallest building in the world

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,468
but I think the a bull the or the one in
Dubai took over

18
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:07,580
anyway I going over by f-secure what we
do

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,560
I we found a 1988 base in Helsinki

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,659
and Finland so while on call with the
largest

21
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,439
office outside of about three hundred
guys in a

22
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,100
while temple I witnessed in stock
exchange in 1999

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,298
and today we are in water by just Luis

24
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:30,880
from anti-virus products to our content
our products

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,369
including online backups and we surf

26
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,799
assists Louis for lets you must
cooperate

27
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,900
and as well as operators so ISP's

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,509
we do deliver services for them our way
around the world who have about

29
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:51,810
now some people a white twenty offices
around the world

30
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,950
so that's a beautiful picture of

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,360
very call Helsinki right now is a bit of
a summertime

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,250
that so headquarters in Helsinki that's
my office in Malaysia

33
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:10,270
very hot place so they love to come to
Malaysia that's my fancy office

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,099
I'll where we do on the monitoring
basically from

35
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,170
are hunting for viruses

36
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,429
I think from now add to collection
samples analysis

37
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,580
so partially is on on hand the kale
office

38
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,950
soso housing the office so was my talk
to the gonna be about

39
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,069
alright up the mobile platform has been
a big deal

40
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,730
I BVN has already talked about it
yesterday about

41
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,910
court also how to a backup your phone
how to protect

42
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,160
rights and permissions so too then went
out a few more stories

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,859
about some scary stories about Android
okay

44
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,940
so I'll gonna let this dais where

45
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,690
phone was just a fall first and foremost
SP a spot the difference game

46
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,920
was a different from the first screen
Sask

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,940
a second picture yes

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,959
i think is correct basic a today how to
use bought

49
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,060
a malicious at you almost don't 0 unless

50
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,659
you going to reviewing the developer
looking into packages

51
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:24,260
look and a certificate way that way the
sign you probably wouldn't know

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,840
way official come from alright

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,209
on not too long ago actually three weeks
ago we our laps

54
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,000
we we do some hunting and we file some
major tainted absentia

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,610
Google Play Store of course I we're
trying to beat bill

56
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,450
and you guys no no but fumbled as
alright so

57
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,560
which are known to be them down but they
have a really good a

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,090
security system in place called bouncer
and if you catch

59
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,120
really well I love malicious activities
but

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,019
in today's day and age and how easy
guess I mean have and repackage it is

61
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,250
really really difficult

62
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,920
to find a witch's room which is not real
I'll

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,609
you went hehe ABS was some examples of
how

64
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,560
developers or hackers on our way to
school repack issues Trojans

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760
into the applications and by into with a
piece or

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,389
which for most of us which is on it
right away are

67
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,650
three weeks ago was a bad case of bad
piggies which is a real one

68
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,549
yes against no on TV and games

69
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,210
I alright

70
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:41,210
yes so we have been that case about
peace

71
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,729
um the reaction we package love this

72
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,190
and put the bat on the way on the web of
for example

73
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,889
back to use his real name way so this
guide and Stokes

74
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:59,310
basically don't know that the bad
piggies

75
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,470
but nowhere in sight testing can be up
to the store

76
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,610
I make it look like as if you would and
also for most people it would just dull

77
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,490
either want this case and these two are
definitely

78
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,470
effective that's how you got no one to
your phone

79
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,410
in fact you will list it right when you
do a search bat peaks

80
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,770
so that they were always on top

81
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,400
right so that's how you do it so this we
finally about two and a half weeks ago

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,969
are really we win phone call go and all
that stuff but

83
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,639
you know it it just tells there's no
safe place out there right now

84
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,690
so precise not only bad pics they also

85
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,719
the a few more like for chop ninja

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,060
paper tossed so of in the same guy

87
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,380
so it is very common today and that's
how malls and rifles get in fact that

88
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,340
today

89
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,289
up remove maybe go doesn't like me to
put this layout but

90
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,500
they saw what we actually

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,259
hun as the out there we do see about
these

92
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,370
you know a five to ten percent at so
that which I actually could be tainted

93
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,050
with

94
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,759
not really malware but could be also
potentially at where

95
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,449
is hard to categorize Swiss where where
and Puno

96
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,940
right attaching I want to applications

97
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,240
so that's what we see today now

98
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,710
you might think that is nice and safe
way

99
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,909
sophie is good up was a while working on
today

100
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,850
s time span looking for the party
markets

101
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,810
we call them site loading so far more so
you will

102
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,389
Android users enough three games yes

103
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:47,050
the next time somebody says you a free
what's at free Angry Birds fetus and

104
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,360
most likely to host the in some sites in
China

105
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,780
artist in Europe we are seeing I love
this

106
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,099
that party sites are usually is free
tool

107
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,550
so this up favorite metal down some
playgrounds for had to support

108
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,370
on identification of their

109
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,520
alright other much time left right

110
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,909
so um boys becomes a big deal

111
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,039
I know even as i introduce I don't
repeat this again

112
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,110
we spend more time reading email and
mobile today

113
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,180
now laptop I'm sure that's very true

114
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,699
if you can see that that trend going up
there

115
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,919
which means I love this kinda like well

116
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,659
with the trend that ISO Ayer this on the
fresh

117
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,150
up malware though

118
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,239
samples for was security I collect that

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,150
about few months ago

120
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,270
this is based on the number of families

121
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,889
so they are not we we don't know the
Mumbai detections right detection though

122
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,970
it's not like a web 10,000 august twenty
thousand this

123
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,430
but this is just my family and a number
of viruses we see

124
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,360
the new ones comes out every three
months so if you can see from a

125
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,699
101 of last year to call the 10 this
year

126
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,740
every three months we're seeing a higher
in 15 your time zone lol

127
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,539
so that some scary stuff I don't know
about you

128
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,650
compared to many years back Classico we
used to be one on the plane is in

129
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,210
doing F anti-virus for while

130
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,739
so costing in today

131
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,260
that's when I see a great part here
mozhem lol actually in

132
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,610
a focus i thinkin in Europe is a real
big thing

133
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,940
our dazzle of cash cards a lot of pain
when using the phone

134
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,279
so this means that I really actually a a
big decline

135
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,560
from singin' at 62 percent to

136
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,959
lasts two years ago but they percent as
a man going down I guess what's coming

137
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:52,760
up

138
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,250
Android I if I'm a virus

139
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,560
rider today are probably the fun you
play well

140
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,709
which %uh smartphone and the thing is
not I was really take

141
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,779
really precautions about smartphones
even mention you know how easy is it to

142
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,260
with a swiping so

143
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,050
a low inflation could be lost especially
pictures

144
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,380
company data and why do they do this

145
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,660
so interesting always only company data
and you know

146
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,010
information is about money

147
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,010
we need analysis for the acute one of

148
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,730
up this year the last three months more
then

149
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,570
I was safe for 70 percent in the Maui
today a profit motivated

150
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,589
so this guy's here the EDS somehow steal
money from you

151
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,170
on the steel your information is so
funny

152
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,560
now you'll be asking how do you make
money from having on my way

153
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,339
phone or here of premium SMS

154
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:59,450
no not so popular in the United States
