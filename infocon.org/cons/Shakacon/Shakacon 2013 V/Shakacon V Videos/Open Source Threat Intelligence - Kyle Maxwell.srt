1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,220
here researcher at Verizon in there are
risks team but he's also I think

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,160
are problem gonna be more well known for
being

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,799
wanna the coffers uprisings data breach
risk riddick investigation data Beach

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,820
data breach investigations okay saw

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,500
how do you guys have read that report
yeah how do you guys use that to talk to

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,710
your management about why

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,510
yeah okay I can keep going we are
definitely an awesome paper

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,990
really exciting happen today talking
about up open source intelligence a

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,500
please give a warm welcome

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,079
right will be for taxol say aloha y'all
so

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,800
want everybody thanks for coming out
here today I'm just a curiosity

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,718
how many have you folks are local to the
state of Hawaii

13
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,649
sweet how many have you folks are fine
and from

14
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:55,260
mainland US ever other countries
completely

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,410
excellent excellent good to get a nice

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,279
brought scope here today we're really
talking about today

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,659
as much and is open source print out for
a break down a little bit

18
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,340
about what that means before we get
started a

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,689
my legal and PR folks real get mad if I
don't say something like this:

20
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,798
up so if I say something dumb and you're
like man

21
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,470
kyle is a real picture and that's just
on me up

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,880
and if you think about somebody else
that just on them to please don't if

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,970
cute that to me

24
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,670
so what are we talking about I don't
know then we're really gonna have a

25
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,770
really boring our

26
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,619
right but I promise we walk let's break
it down a little bit

27
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,220
up when we talk about open source we
don't really mean

28
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,310
open source in the typeof in and
software

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,290
although I am a bit uva you know free
software for you know

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,340
lear in open source software sell it
that's not we're talking about today

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,579
although when we talk about software

32
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,829
today almost everything that will
mention will be open source in that

33
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,960
sense that we talk with open source
Intel

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,240
we're talking about data information
that

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,469
you can get from over sources
traditionally that mean things like

36
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,519
newspapers and and phone books

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,690
and things like that rather than you
know secretly gathered

38
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,020
information we talk about threat

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,000
we're talking about put the parts are
brisk

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,860
they don't have anything to do with the
assets per se that were

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,180
protecting or attacking we're not
talking about

42
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,470
former abilities and and problems that
people find it does we're talking about

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,629
I'm if you've read the Dvir hopefully
everybody has

44
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,700
I'll actors and actions primarily

45
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,349
threat really the first two who did
something bad although we're gonna

46
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:43,069
expand that a little bit

47
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,170
and talk about what quote-unquote bad
things

48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,030
they did we're not focused exactly on

49
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,940
investigations although my team does a
lot of those

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,920
but certainly we can support those so
you anytime they are trying to just

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,000
understand

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,930
what is actually happening in terms of
the bad things that are happening

53
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,080
when we talk about intelligence really

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,870
Intel is the product of data and
analysis right

55
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,700
you get a lot of information and some
smart folks sit in a room and go through

56
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,140
it all

57
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,529
try to understand it and do what they do
and they provide something out to

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,190
decision makers to decide

59
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,390
what they're gonna do based on what they
learned were gonna

60
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,760
generalize a little bit for the purposes
love this talk

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,579
talk about kinda raw data and I guess
not really true raw data but close to it

62
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,620
up and we're going to focus on gathering

63
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,459
all of these data and the tools that we
can use to analyze them on what we might

64
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,159
use

65
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,280
to analyze them why is this important
all go very quickly

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,730
through a couple of pieces from the BB I
R %uh you may have seen this figure in

67
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,709
there this is

68
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,349
how quickly breaches happen how quickly
we discover them so

69
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:55,869
if you look at it the top row is how
long it takes

70
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,870
from the initial attack on average to a
compromise

71
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,030
and if you look at the bottom it's its
kind of a little bit

72
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,159
qualitative seconds minutes hours days
weeks months years

73
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,739
so like eighty-five percent up the
breaches in our dataset

74
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,239
the initial compromise succeeded and
hours or less

75
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,759
and the next release data exfiltration
that succeeded

76
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,009
up about two-thirds the time in hours or
less

77
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,630
and look at this the next rose discovery

78
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,780
look two-thirds the time it takes months
or longer just to discover that you've

79
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,219
been breached

80
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,280
containment another thing how long it
takes and thats a

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,429
a larger different sorta issue but just
to

82
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,100
point out how quickly these things
happen and how bad we can we as an

83
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,850
industry

84
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,460
are in general at discovering them and
what they do

85
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,479
get discovered who discovers them well
in our dataset

86
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,250
a third of the time it took unrelated
third party that is to say not a card

87
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,009
brand

88
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,660
not law enforcement just somebody else X
doing an investigation

89
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,020
or monitoring something and they call up
in order to say hey

90
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,780
guys are hate to tell you this but to in
the course for this other investigation

91
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,090
we're pretty sure that you've been 0

92
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,599
how do you know well you know we were
monitored we're investing in this other

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,660
system we found evidence blah blah blah

94
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,940
fraud detection this is things like
uncommon for to purchase from card brand

95
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,560
so if you

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,620
ever see like PCI related investigations
PF I

97
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,500
up that's what that is so look at the
top five methods are all

98
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,250
external that's not good

99
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,020
because look at the bottom is that all
the internal message the one that

100
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,789
organization spent show

101
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,770
much time and energy and effort either
implemented or at least convincing

102
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,710
auditors

103
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,680
that they've implemented ham up

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,509
and we suck it does okay a big part of
that might be things like

105
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:58,150
okay we install this system metro-dade
is flowing so that the auditors

106
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,580
get off our back and we're doing log
management not analysis and

107
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,639
we have intrusion prevention system so
we're

108
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,669
preventing these things from him to have
a look well

109
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,680
hopefully one in this room kinda knows
why that's total fail to

110
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,490
up so this is the motivation right of
why

111
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,940
we need to get better at trying to
discover things more quickly

112
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,199
and hopefully ourselves because honestly
so my team we do a lot of

113
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,990
up breach notifications a lot of
organizations like ours do as well

114
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,360
a hours like a lot of them are
completely separate from a sales process

115
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,310
I'm not a sales person it by any stretch
the imagination

116
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,350
so some money for my team calls your see
so and leaves a voicemail hey what kinda

117
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,600
so you think with that same for a secure
network

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,919
do you really need to know please call
us back seriously call us back

119
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,250
where we get data on

120
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,759
threat were kinda places can we grab
this information

121
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,979
frock up one way to do that is there's a
tall

122
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,630
sponsored by the rent i sec research and
education network may see its

123
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,409
all it's the i sec for colleges and
research institutions and things like

124
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,130
that

125
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,909
and they got a team out there with up
west young can get really over you know

126
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,050
in some other guys

127
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,060
and they've written a tool called sieve
collective intelligence framework

128
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,530
that sucks in a bunch of feeds up

129
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,059
originally from public sources are you
can configure tripling from your own

130
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,930
stuff right so if you've got a salmon
it's a call here all the folks that are

131
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,470
you know trying to brute force password
reports can you reconstruct those things

132
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,620
in any way

133
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,979
%uh David J bianco was really smart guy
I'm

134
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,719
highs a blog at the tech respond blocks
but dot com talks about what he calls

135
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,449
the pyramid a pain

136
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,870
and it's not a WWE thing even though it
kinda sounds like it

137
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,259
the idea is that the

138
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,460
the easiest stuff together is the stuff
the probably the lowest value

139
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,560
and the stuff that is the hardest to
gather of the stuff

140
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,740
that makes the most difficult for your
attackers so

141
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,629
safe really focuses on the lower levels
here

142
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,729
IP addresses is there anybody really
that can't harvest

143
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,900
IP addresses that are doing bad things
okay that's pretty straightforward right

144
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,138
we're talking about more about that way
to get them domain names almost

145
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,440
as easy when you start getting to

146
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,949
network artifacts you know what to look
for traces host artifacts

147
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,849
now you have to work a little bit harder
both to get that information and to use

148
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:29,659
it

149
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,209
now we talk about specific tools
anti-peace tools techniques and

150
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,329
procedures attack things and procedures

151
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,589
now it's really tough but it's a tough
on both ends because on the one hand

152
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,320
it's tough to get this information is
tough to use it

153
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,890
but that's where you can also bring the
pain to the adversary to the threat

154
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,620
actor

155
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,470
the second against your network and see
if what you do lookups right lets you

156
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,149
please i ask me why twenty years later I
still remember the

157
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,649
name server: IP address from my
university but

158
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:01,860
it's like example while we still use I'm
so you can query for an IP address

159
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,040
and see if it's been if it shows up in
any of the feeds

160
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,209
you agree for a domain name you could
pull out feed you can say show me

161
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:10,399
everything

162
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,870
that is an IP address related to malware

163
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,380
write a fifty percent confidence or more
right

164
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,660
and you can't then go to match that
against say your network traffic or

165
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,860
whatever

166
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,120
up and what it does is it pulls and
sources from

167
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,670
a bunch up all the data for a bunch of
different sources there's just

168
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,180
tons of sources everywhere up

169
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,459
abuse that CH is fantastic alien vault
is another great source they actually

170
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:38,630
are aggregate

171
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,100
a bunch of them so that's probably like
the easiest big hitters to get a couple

172
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,130
of these

173
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,850
above all of these folks provide

174
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,820
lists love these different couple we
talked about before the lower end of the

175
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,760
pyramid of pain

176
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,880
I just like with sound when I say that
sorry up

177
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,100
and you can call to collate these into
whether it's if whether or not you write

178
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,910
your own

179
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,480
there are tools that can feed directly
into your Sam like

180
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,510
you know ArcSight or whatever it is that
you're using

181
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,290
and there's a bunch of these you can
feed and and so what do you do with

182
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,230
these

183
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,860
you go back and you look at some
detection stuff you go back and you

184
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,790
a you may not this really is a for
blocking I don't really recommend that

185
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,079
most cases

186
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,939
because you know the confidence level in
any of these may not be a hundred

187
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,100
percent

188
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,570
right other other things are good to use
our passive DNS I love

189
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,510
passive DNS like I would marry if it was
legal

190
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,700
well Marty may try to go to Utah to do
that but else Knox case are you tough ok

191
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,000
so I apologize that was

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,360
inappropriate I S C

193
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,860
provides a DNA sales were passive the NS
is really simple it's not actually going

194
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,120
to look at what's not doing like a
recursive

195
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,390
DNS lookup like a typically think okay
do I have this cast my local DNS server

196
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,459
no I'm gonna go find out who the
authoritative -ism

197
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,750
okay right you're probably knows how DNS
works what this does is this

198
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,519
caches and keep the historical record of
the responses

199
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,620
so up if you look up

200
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,940
a particular domain name for a
particular time

201
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,970
or not after think the domain I wanna
see all the IP addresses that you know

202
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,110
about

203
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,029
that showed up in somebody's actual
query so what it does is all these

204
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,399
organizations gonna pull it together
where you're from different sources

205
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,120
and they cashed response what this time
somebody made a request for this domain

206
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,040
address

207
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,760
and I got back this response record

208
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,620
resource record up and this is what you
get to you see okay

209
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,370
on April 4th at 1955

210
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,510
this particular domain which by the way
was related to

211
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,950
for I just like making is that this is
actual life data

212
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,720
from I believe this was a domain used
above that was

213
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,480
used to serve malware preying on people
were looking for information about the

214
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,180
Boston

215
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,339
bop marathon bombings and the West Texas

216
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,000
up disaster that same week up

217
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,820
so these and then at the next day at
1:59

218
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,930
another IP address right probably like a
fACTBOX domain

219
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,979
so the strike two sources when you get
these well I S E has one

220
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,750
there's no one called BFK %uh from a
company in Germany

221
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,820
that does something similar but more

222
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,110
related to like Virus Total they do the
same thing basically

223
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,399
when they do analysis on something and
buyer for those cases when they analyze

224
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,269
a sample

225
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,690
it catches all those the unit responses
are you can see if you search for an IP

226
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,420
address

227
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,899
in Virus Total it will tell you via is
passive DNS

228
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,560
hey this was the response that we got
and here's the malware sample

229
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,268
that tried to look it up in our sandbox
cock super cool

230
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,040
malware data in general it that's the
type of threat data that you are looking

231
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,099
for

232
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,019
okay so virustotal hopefully everybody
hears kind familiar with it if not

233
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,500
it is probably the most well-known for
of the only good one

234
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,300
but the most well-known site for public
data

235
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,180
on our up you can search by

236
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,449
hash you can search by domain name URL
but some other indicators

237
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,800
as image before includes passive DNS
related to these malware call-outs

238
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,649
I really don't know how to pronounce the
next one official sleep now we're not

239
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,329
calmer more about com

240
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:30,439
a I don't know if the guys for our
twelfth on whether have more files in

241
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,170
there

242
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,880
I'll additional data in here and they
have

243
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,899
its kinda sorta virustotal they have
feeds ove

244
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,670
reset samples here's all the hassles we
got recently I think there's a fetus

245
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,920
fuzzy after I could be wrong on that
above other positive indicators

246
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,750
related to shadow server who if they
have a lot of different projects the

247
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,470
review policy their name pop up a budget
plan for they do

248
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,889
fantastic work kinda in this general
area

249
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:00,209
of trying to track badness if you will
on the Internet

250
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,239
virus chair dot com is a whole different
sort of thing it's a relatively large

251
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,110
recall the last time I looked

252
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,959
couple months ago they were up to over
three terabytes

253
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,449
above malware samples I'm index
searchable single search for a half

254
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:17,329
and he says oh you've got this
information on it and if you want a copy

255
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:17,870
of it

256
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,810
its in this kind of celeb repository
what they do is they have a bunch of

257
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,388
like

258
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:26,760
about 25 to 30 gigabyte kind of sub
repose

259
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,389
that are shared be a bit torrent
hopefully you're a

260
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,060
ISP doesn't think that your likes
pirated movies or whatever

261
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,930
up it is a a king like the others these
our community

262
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,099
well okay Irish total is owned by Google
now but but now I dot com a harsher dot

263
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,800
com

264
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,389
are our community sites up

265
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,089
so anybody can help out with these about
their pretty fantastic as

266
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,630
aside an example a few months ago

267
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,290
I guess nothing more than a few months
but the several months ago

268
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,010
another a forensic investigation
organization least a pretty well known

269
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,829
well

270
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,910
read report on a up

271
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,430
threat actor that they located in
Shanghai China right

272
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,638
they released this big report everybody
talked about it

273
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,720
and there were a bunch of a indicators
in the technical appendices with a

274
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,870
fantastic

275
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,610
they matched up well with what a lot of
people who have been tracking this

276
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,690
particular group

277
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,720
head but it was a person so they
released passes for them our closer look

278
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,839
at them our gnarly case for that with
you

279
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,300
that's you know not there were allowed
to give out understand

280
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,620
of people there with a search on fire if
you're not confidence has about half of

281
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,509
them were there

282
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,000
so it's not just commodity stuff that's
their I'll

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,320
a lot of people upload samples that then
get a

284
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,540
years later on for that type of research

285
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,550
okay so that's just a general threat day
that the lower into the Pyramid of pain

286
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,120
what about threat actors after all

287
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,829
really in the and all this stuff there's
a human being or Senate human beings

288
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:02,189
behind what is a threat actor for for
not very old man

289
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,019
open even though he's a fantastic
villain

290
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:09,459
up and I guess now Benedict Cumberbatch
I guess I should use him now because he

291
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:10,508
was so awesome the news

292
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:14,350
in the new Star Trek movie nephews the
only awesome party up

293
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,000
at if a record this case are entities
human beings

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,389
or set to human beings that cause or
contribute to an incident

295
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,790
up generally speaking a thread after
doesn't have to be more with my doesn't

296
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,189
have to act with malicious intention in
this case we're focused on those that do

297
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,600
so somebody who deliberately violates
policy in an organization

298
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,649
um to make that you know turning off
their password on their BlackBerry

299
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,529
as we heard this morning up could be a
factor in Internet sense but we don't

300
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,829
really care about tracking that is you
know who your

301
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:49,989
executives or losers are

302
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,829
think a sources for information on this
it depends on the type

303
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:59,180
ove threat actor that you're looking at
so if you're looking at for example

304
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,888
up hacktivist horsely certain types of
activist

305
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,459
twitter has tremendous amounts
information on it up

306
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,600
pastebin does pay Spanish crack down a
little bit on sum up the scrapers

307
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,030
up partly because a lot of scrapers are
really impolite

308
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,530
and are causing big load spikes their

309
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,750
up so there's a couple different ways
that you can be monitoring

310
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,539
pastebin for interesting stuff there's a
lot of spam on pace for the you don't

311
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:27,750
have to wade through

312
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,120
up but if you follow for example paceman
dorks on Twitter does a lot of this for

313
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,918
you she could follow that

314
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,070
up Google Alerts hopefully what is
familiar with it

315
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,480
what Google Alerts really does is give
you periodic updates on

316
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,990
new information that shows up when they
are crawling the web

317
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,470
for certain terms they can be in just
news articles aqui unblock me in

318
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,270
whatever

319
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,260
so if you want to turn a specific actor
and you're trying to find information is

320
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,629
posted about them

321
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,890
a Vista me pretty fantastic for groups
that

322
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,710
have a little bit of publicity around
them

323
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,700
if what you're looking for but more
commodity this is for

324
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,400
a stuff that is not this is like the
Super Target if you're interested in

325
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,450
defacement incidents like that above
these two sites typically mirror that

326
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,460
stuff they have really good records
ovett

327
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,929
there was another one a called of the
sea

328
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,330
that is for like is offline due to some
financial problems the a

329
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,899
the admin had but they track

330
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,929
things like up leaks love email
addresses and passwords and things like

331
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:31,620
that

332
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,629
so these are against sources love data

333
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,960
to bring again

334
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,240
how do we store all this information
because all my god drinking from the

335
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,780
fire hose like in UHF right

336
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,470
well one you can use some basic web
tools Evernote feedly

337
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,669
effed if is kind of like a

338
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:53,799
it's called it means if this than that
so it's a kinda want these

339
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,840
web 2.0 web social web is types of sites
resale K

340
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,490
when this happened at the sight of what
I tagging item and delicious

341
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,919
I want you to tweak that or when I

342
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,110
get this when the weather happens like
this I want you to send me an SMS or or

343
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,870
whatever

344
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,989
she can glue all these things together
that way for relatively easy stuff

345
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,250
up that might be fine as a
proof-of-concept

346
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,870
but you really wouldn't want to use that
in an organization for doing any kind of

347
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,989
serious work

348
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,270
because it's not that flexible up

349
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,260
but fortunately everything has API's
just about these days so you can use a

350
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,169
simple scripting language like Python

351
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:37,200
I guess if Europe if the program I could
use Ruby but

352
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,990
force the hipster program a prior by if
indeed all the reviews this

353
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,910
through vs in here today I'll you could
store the stuff like in a docking

354
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,809
according to type database like mango or
something like that

355
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:52,309
%uh this is really flexible with you do
it this way this is what we do

356
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,379
we sucking on its information stored in
there so that

357
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,440
if it disappears later we have a record
of it up that requires a lot more effort

358
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,659
obviously but this is a great way to
suck in the kind of this

359
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,830
relatively unstructured data

360
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,139
and store it for these purposes

361
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,929
okay so I have all this data will intel
is not just date if this was the case

362
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:18,510
we would be done here and go home we
have saved the Internet

363
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,530
and that's not true so one other

364
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,970
there's a fantastic tool called multi go
this is not open source software

365
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,110
a although they're really cool guys up

366
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,979
the out of out of South Africa and what
alter ego doesn't let you

367
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,880
create these types of graphs I guess you

368
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,360
can't really see here but they're are
you know weeks between these different

369
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,889
node in each node

370
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,740
could be a person it could be a URL
could be an IP address an hour after

371
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,760
registry key whatever

372
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,980
and link them together and then the real
power

373
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,460
is in running transformed for a simple
example to explain a Transformers I have

374
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,330
a note that represents a domain name

375
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,668
and I want to transform to get the IP
address now I have two notes

376
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:03,940
but a link the domain name resolve to
this IP address

377
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,880
and then you can do what's a reverse DNS
IP address and get all the domains that

378
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,270
result back to it

379
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,150
then you can get the WHOIS information
who owns those domains and you see where

380
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,289
this is going

381
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:18,879
up you don't just have to use their
transforms if I can only recommend it

382
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,590
because

383
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,740
what they give you is just kind of the
generic tool set

384
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,450
that is not enough almost certainly for
what you need

385
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,919
okay up canary is a project

386
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,350
open source project to simplify the
development

387
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,199
writing this transformed is already
pretty straightforward but this kinda

388
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,710
gives you a framework

389
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,090
both to write them and deploy them
locally because you have to

390
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,270
to a lot of work typically in the quiet
to say hey I've written this transform

391
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,809
I want to use it when I a it's for these
types of

392
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,049
so it for IP addresses when I want to do
a passive DNS lookup

393
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,610
up a canary did simplifies you don't
have to do all the work in the client to

394
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,820
set that up

395
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,799
I'm on our team are principally written
by a guy on my team although a lot of a

396
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,559
security code to it

397
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,610
we have to call now for many which

398
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,510
despite the name Mauer transformed into
these results track a lot of types a bad

399
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,190
infrastructure if you will

400
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,919
of it is also open source and you can
use it works in conjunction with canary

401
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,580
and pull it down what it does is
something relatively since let's use

402
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,908
this as an example its cool little bit
fuzzy here

403
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:28,260
but I'll walk you through at the top we
have

404
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,520
an initial link that was a URL to I'll

405
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,539
a to a %uh now over ties in sight

406
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:42,539
K and that redirected you actually to
exploit service lets with the

407
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,590
ones here are or from there we have no
form is OK those the URL's

408
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,178
let's grab the website's looks like to
drive the No main

409
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,710
the domain we get the IP addresses

410
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,929
and then from there we were so k what
other servers are hosted whether

411
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:03,260
domains rather on from that IP address
look all of those look suspicious

412
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,650
those are bad thing so now we have a
start anyway I'm looking at this bad

413
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,200
sort of infrastructure you can kind of
see

414
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,520
over here the yellow we started mapping
out the entire

415
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,580
infrastructure and so now for me let's
just

416
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,620
do write some additional or have
additional transforms to do that

417
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,760
it also lets you do things like look up
specific hashes at

418
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,020
virustotal and now we're not comin it
for an expert in a few places like that

419
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,740
she can start to do some analysis there
we see here

420
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,000
so you can do have two domains drop
files has two IP so if you have a hash

421
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,390
weather information can I get out of it
you can used to all the support he go

422
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,279
multi-goal is really not a tool for data
stored just it's a tool for interactive

423
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,559
analysis

424
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,070
so then you would wanna go store this
information somehow there's different

425
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,340
ways to do that

426
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,340
if you are storing and analyzing

427
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,740
malware samples there's a couple
different ways to do it

428
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,960
why is if you just have a relatively
small set maybe you're working set

429
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,580
love sample for particular investigation
malware house

430
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,520
a written by Scott Robert shoes /a a
fantastic the FR

431
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,760
guy a guy like think it was a friend at
a at get up

432
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,539
it's a relatively simple database here

433
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:22,408
right where you can up imports sample
that the semantic have some initial by

434
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:23,429
the data like

435
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:28,010
fuzzy the fuzzy half time the maybe you
can tell what the source you got it from

436
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,620
and so forth

437
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,449
%uh it doesn't scale to large sets I
wouldn't use it for more than like a 100

438
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,279
200 stempel's myself

439
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,659
um VX cage is a much larger

440
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,710
complete database it off a lot more
complicated to

441
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,159
use and work with because it's so much
more powerful

442
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,490
I'm thinkin s paint compared to
Photoshop rights guys gonna hit me that

443
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,250
I could call this

444
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,409
stuff must paint now is what it is a

445
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,260
think this is your big complete
repository so let's say that you pulled

446
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,070
in

447
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,070
I'll every piece of malware that you
ever think

448
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,210
may get detected in your or that in your
organization

449
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,289
and you pull in I'm virus share and
whatever else you want to store on there

450
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,539
this is beware what you are you would do
it

451
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:13,799
if anybody is working with now where

452
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,789
and doing dynamic analysis you probably
have at least have heard of coo coo

453
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:22,210
now there are are and commercial
projects they do suck similar stuff but

454
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,440
Google is still

455
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,640
pretty much fantastic or does it if runs

456
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,870
malware inside a sandbox

457
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,649
up tries or behavior analysis I mean
even capture screenshots of what

458
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,779
happened which is

459
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:38,279
good for things like a ran somewhere

460
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,549
or or of the old like the old and

461
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:45,679
you like two years ago olden days fake
AV before and some work people realize

462
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,140
that hey there's like a

463
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,169
people was like four-time 4x uptake

464
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,169
on that stuff a integrated virustotal
expose an API written in Python

465
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,010
fantastic for doing

466
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,870
analysis on that stuff so you bring all
these and you could

467
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,120
as an example every time you text me
some now where

468
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,418
run it and a sandbox whether you have
coo coo without you go

469
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:11,230
you know by one a from from a vendor
fact one of the sponsors here

470
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,919
does does that and they do really good
work um

471
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,669
and cook a sandbox well then lets you

472
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:23,179
analyze that stuff directly there are a
number of standards

473
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,900
for exchanging threat Intel so first
let's talk about these and then we'll

474
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,760
talk a little bit

475
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,720
in a minute about who to exchange it
with so

476
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,110
up open IOC and sigh box are two

477
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,740
very similar though not identical %uh
standards one from mandiant one from

478
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,919
The MITRE Corporation which is why those
federally funded

479
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,169
the kind of semi-private not really

480
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,770
research corporation's up

481
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,408
and both basically in both cases they do
kinda the same thing they try to capture

482
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:55,799
something that you can actually

483
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,360
observe something state folk so a file
hash

484
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,389
and I P obtuse a particular strain HTP
get request

485
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,130
whatever and there's a little bit is
there's not just one piece so you can

486
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,230
see if you see

487
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,340
these five things if you do and all five
of these things

488
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,220
or you see these other two things and so
you can blow for Boolean logic

489
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,690
into them and look for specific

490
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,779
indicators you say aha this fits

491
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,960
number superfly a flare and say that we
have observed

492
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,470
something related to whatever you think
this was this was pretty clear at

493
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,010
or this was indication or a particular
attacker you been tracking

494
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,820
or so just something bad you know I'm
occurred somebody installed and map

495
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,689
on their local machine semantics but
tell you that that's a virus or

496
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,190
something right

497
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,000
or any antivirus right but that just
this the idea is kinda

498
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,840
way a ride in your own signatures if you
will

499
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,439
but that doesn't give you any context
that doesn't tell you but you just told

500
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,279
you it is

501
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,740
this sticks is kinda have a layer

502
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,890
up from that if you will in the stack

503
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,000
you can give context to this day

504
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,570
so you have these observables what does
it mean well

505
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,770
with you Chris text document right back
to a sigh box document

506
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:17,309
and sticks lets you specify a whole
bunch of different things you can say

507
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:20,940
okay this is to pray to this campaign

508
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,850
you can have a hold of non-campaign you
can has a this its related to this

509
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,928
particular set of three attackers

510
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:31,730
we recommend this course of action they
typically exploit these types of targets

511
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,350
she can put a lot of context around that
because like a lot of things in life

512
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:41,279
up intelligence data without context

513
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,590
is just bits okay so what what do I do
with this

514
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,620
up remind you have years ago

515
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,729
up this is this issue a lot different
things if you doing pen testing I'm

516
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,669
years ago I work with a a client with
their previous

517
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,669
web app tester heavily this was

518
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,230
like 10-12 years ago right had run

519
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,580
a just kind of one of those generic I
think it was like a

520
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,220
web inspector evers given the default
twelve hundred page report from the

521
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,539
application scanner

522
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,580
and handed it to the client so here you
go and their

523
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,779
they look at me look at them in them
meeting said what am I gonna do with

524
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,070
this wipe my butt with it

525
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,740
so who just wants information I could do
anything with well the same thing here

526
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,299
you want to give some context to this

527
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:29,809
rather than just getting the 40 from
what CBS wherever like okay grades of

528
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,490
bad stuff

529
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,159
what does that tell me up that is

530
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,679
for kinda you know status to organize
and communicate that to those data

531
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,720
when you wanna come to generalize this a
little bit you need to keep track if

532
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,419
this in a way that your

533
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,960
human analysts two men and women who
understand what they're looking at

534
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,480
can sit down and go through it and
extract

535
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,690
useful information that they can provide
to an appropriate decision maker

536
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,419
up Scott Roberts again men pops up

537
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:05,419
has a set of templates at on his get
help

538
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:08,490
that you can you can also create your
own if you don't like yes I guess

539
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,929
abort the season as a starting point
that's what we did up

540
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:15,350
and you could what they are the center
is creating a wiki

541
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,399
you can have with US different pages for
different artifacts that you looked at

542
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,309
different types of exploits

543
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,360
intrusion sets particular actors that
you're interested in so you like okay

544
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,418
we've heard a lot

545
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:28,500
about this particular hacking team we're
worried about it because

546
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,830
they hit a nor our sister organization
last month when you keep an eye on what

547
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,710
they're doing

548
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,990
and you can then automatically pollen
let's say

549
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,740
data from your document dated to talk
about a moment ago

550
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,880
to bring all this together %uh

551
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,610
that's four kind of the generic threat
intelligence

552
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,139
actor intelligence sorts of information
if you're talking about

553
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,350
IOC's well thats fine other but we do it
because you want to automate this to a

554
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,260
degree

555
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,929
so you wanna pull feeds from safe

556
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:03,320
or whatever other cool like we've got
one internally that we use now that

557
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,110
we've written

558
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,090
I'm in-house that focuses on our
particular needs and

559
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,549
works with the summer the internal
relations we feed 82

560
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:15,610
up into your Sam you can at least gonna
do some matching their

561
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,709
up that's just kinda a basic start
because that's really

562
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,960
turning this into signatures that in to
rate a little bit faster

563
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,870
you want to be able to do more than that
though you also want to be able to not

564
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,699
just

565
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,110
a match on your network right also want
to build a sweep ok so there are a lot

566
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:37,059
of commercial tools that do this a lot
of folks who will sell you a solution

567
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,889
that can go you go put in eight on a
system it's basically

568
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,600
the same basic idea as anti-virus for
try to do

569
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,549
a little bit more with that she can grab
a evidence from a system and you can

570
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:52,080
sweep for particular things that you
want to look for

571
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,460
rather than whatever the folks back at
McAfee or somatic

572
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,390
ever tell you are bad I'm as where
they've done a lot of work for you

573
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,450
but you may have specific things you
look for although a couple tools you can

574
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,860
use pie I ACH

575
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,709
is one up there's another one I don't
have the link here

576
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,360
but if you search for a grr on Google
Code

577
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,668
it's the Google Rapid Response framework
it's basically something somewhat what

578
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,309
Google actually does internally

579
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:22,019
a and you can talk to their I R guys
about the they're pretty happy talk

580
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:23,169
about what really

581
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:26,720
the idea behind all these things
commercial or or not

582
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,179
is you put a little agent on a system
and you say I wanna sweet for these

583
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,510
particular indicators are compromised

584
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,549
and or I want to pull back a memory
image

585
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:39,110
or a registry downpour list of running
processes or whatever

586
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:43,049
so I can match against thing said i'm
looking for.

587
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:47,269
in general this area of general threat
analysis

588
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,029
is really where the work happens
everything else we talk about the forest

589
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:51,250
building stuff

590
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,929
to get to this point and this is the
part where you can automate

591
00:32:55,929 --> 00:33:00,140
anymore you have out amid everything you
can automate

592
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,370
and you still have to do this stuff this
is where you need

593
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,309
smart people given the time and
resources that we talk about

594
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:10,649
to be able to go through these data

595
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:13,850
and understand your business and
understand who

596
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,090
your adversaries might be so I'll

597
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:21,720
in my previous gig I worked at a payment
processor

598
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,559
well we kind of had understand at least
a high-level a foo our adversaries work

599
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,139
people who want money because we're
processing

600
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,929
you know billions of dollars of
transactions or whatever every

601
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:35,279
so often so we are particular set

602
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,620
love types of things that we cared about
I'm whereas we didn't care because we're

603
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,049
process credit cards we didn't care

604
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:45,179
as much about nation state actors cuz I
just ate actors on Flickr a credit card

605
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:45,470
number

606
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,580
them i care about. business plans for
example but not we're doing vice versa

607
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,799
an R&D shop right knees understand the
typeof adversaries they might have

608
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,769
especially they don't have any typeof
quick payment information or things like

609
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:57,529
that

610
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:00,830
so this is where the work happens the
real work

611
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,370
this is where somebody's gonna go
through and kinda analyze

612
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:09,609
and understand that we've seen these
indicators

613
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:12,639
this is like the pattern that we've seen
for this particular for that we've been

614
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,399
tracking

615
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:18,348
and now I need to get in touch with
somebody else who can help work with us

616
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,149
on a working group or a task force for
law enforcement or what have you

617
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:24,828
which is where you need to be able to
collaborate how are we going to do this

618
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,409
effectively

619
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,359
couple different things to keep in mind
one is try to use standards to okay

620
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,589
at the most basic level sure you can
send a CSV

621
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:39,549
ever some types of things that might be
fine hey here's the SPF IP addresses

622
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,919
to look for that's kind of the
state-of-the-art

623
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,000
that in terms what people are actually
using

624
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,540
today it's far better than you know just
some human written email that somebody

625
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,329
will get to when they can

626
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:56,909
up but you want to just ended like open
I of course I box

627
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,030
perforated build on that to something
like sticks there's a lot of work

628
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,820
I'll in a lot of different communities
subcommittees if you will

629
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,260
to to do these things trust groups are
not open source

630
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,950
are not open source these are for lack
of a better term the good ol boy network

631
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,520
up and I i like to think that as time
goes on

632
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,430
we're gonna kind of a on once they leave
behind because there's always a place

633
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,549
for

634
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,420
you know having it group of people that
you know and trust

635
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,980
up there's going to be said to be able
to share information with somebody that

636
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,320
you trust well enough to you can he
knows

637
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,150
that you know that you know hijos that
if he miss you too that you may come

638
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,640
soccer in the nose at the next

639
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,940
you know happy hour whatever um so it's
not a bus or strictly speaking with the

640
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,280
way the one other ways to get in is to
do good work

641
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,329
give at least some relevant parts of it
in public and

642
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:53,550
up they can be a very significant
targeted both because a lot of these

643
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,140
groups

644
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,259
focus on specific threat actors are
specific types of reactors at least

645
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,480
up and you can still start to
collaborate

646
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,000
on the for intelligence hey with the
second this track we've seen this

647
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,230
anybody should tell me more about this
they might know and

648
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,339
somebody else you know some other really
smart person and other companies you

649
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:11,950
might say

650
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,848
all we saw X as well you are look for
this and we've

651
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:18,410
you know been talking to these other
organizations he only put you in touch

652
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,560
with somebody

653
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,070
another way to collaborate is if there's
one thing that we need

654
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,109
in general and this community its

655
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:33,029
people who know how to write code there
are not a lot of us unfortunately

656
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,880
up who could do any kind of coating that
a lot of

657
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,339
you know I have this whole ramp affect
with the Saints the fires on a ranting

658
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:41,420
about this

659
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,710
about IT security people who people on
the development able to write code

660
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,339
what you can write at least some code
I'll

661
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:54,020
get her is a great place as a as a place
to kinda start working a summer these

662
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,750
projects I mentioned if you have them

663
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,390
I'm you can search for the 12 dancing to
you are a lot of them are there

664
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:03,819
now they're kinda moving away from goal
code or heaven forbid SourceForge

665
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,270
up and not just developers right so if
you're using you say this is the way

666
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,240
that I use it's kind of a pain because
it differently landed

667
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,118
to this workflow we love that kind of
stuff because hey my workflow might be

668
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,440
very different from yours

669
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,210
and either a if you might have a better
idea I'm happy to

670
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:25,010
enable your idea because it lets me also
work that way or be just in general

671
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,630
kinda try to do the right thing

672
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,750
like we talked about earlier with um
notifying

673
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,349
people that have been that have been
compromised or we talk about working

674
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:34,810
with

675
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,078
up trust a group a lot of this is trying
to

676
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,020
you know be a good medicine if you will
I'm not trying to

677
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,390
if I see somebody break into my
neighbor's house

678
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,089
I'm not going to over then try to sell
him an alarm system I'm gonna tell him

679
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,230
that do someone broke in your house
while you're away you

680
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,810
you know check things out up adversaries
talk to each other on some level

681
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,529
right a we see this when

682
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,869
we see recently with a takedown of
Liberty Reserve in all the

683
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:09,310
the panic in certain kinda for Africa
media adversary communities

684
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,119
couldn't go bad guys up we have to do
the same thing

685
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,599
because otherwise if we're divided and
they're working together

686
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,619
whereas with we already have enough
strikes against this that makes it that

687
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:23,070
much more challenging

688
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,730
up as we wrap up and we'll certainly
take questions these are some other

689
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,130
folks that are doing really great work
in this area

690
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,359
if you use Twitter I'm kinda

691
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,940
a look where I use it all the time I see
what people here that I followed her

692
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,500
really smart people they just mother
smart people to follow to get some

693
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,290
information from and just kind of
collaborate with

694
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,490
I'm and I reckon recommend every one of
them as a

695
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,069
some money that can at least in their
area of expertise

696
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,320
talk to you more about these things that
they feel like talking our

697
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,089
part here the first tough so with that
said where is Steph move in the future

698
00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:59,279
what do we need to do more of

699
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,520
well and the public domain at least okay
sure the folks

700
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,910
that work you know and behind closed
doors at all kinda from places

701
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:11,029
they may have their own ways doing stuff
in the areas

702
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,750
that are visible to the rest of us to
the great unwashed masses if you will

703
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,810
a threat after attracting is relatively

704
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,290
not that great me to do a better job
Scott for example which is Scott Robert

705
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,410
S as templates

706
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,910
and that's just the start up there's a
lot of attention

707
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,879
I'm getting better at sharing low and I
often while I will call that a salt

708
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,900
problem

709
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,500
and the way that in of software patching
up in our bodies doing it we all kinda

710
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,329
understand how it should be done

711
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:41,560
we're kind of getting there with this
stuff so now we need to move up that

712
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,940
pyramid of pain

713
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,839
to the TTP with this machine learning or
something else

714
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:49,578
if you want to talk more about this
after the question-answer session you

715
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:51,550
can come from you I'll be here both days

716
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,980
up you can find the best way to reach me
is on Twitter

717
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,520
by far up my wife really hates that
chasm

718
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,380
always between but up you can also email
me

719
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,000
here I war simulator if you want things
personal email addresses that's cool too

720
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
with that said I'll I like to take any
questions anybody has

721
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:20,329
order that whatever bikes

722
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:26,390
I know it's getting close to lunchtime
sandwich

723
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:32,379
is had coffee yes ma'am

724
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,890
to using this team is at Verizon I'm
glad you asked that yes

725
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,910
a at least internally we use that we are
pushing to use

726
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,970
more of them I'll more widely

727
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,209
so I would say it is in its infancy
where I am

728
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,510
up we have my time scales at school here

729
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,680
we have a lot of different internal
organs more like to read thousand-person

730
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,250
organization right

731
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,680
we have that I know I love at least four
different Intel group for example

732
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,730
up there are probably more than I don't
know about we try to work together

733
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,589
trying to get better at that

734
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:07,940
a and this is so why fight with this is
because

735
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,810
I see the pain of exchanging you know
PBS all the time and you know his

736
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,020
personal emails

737
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,210
so we're trying to get better at that
and move towards

738
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,720
on the stuff we also use that we work
like a lot of critical infrastructure

739
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,730
type companies in the DHS

740
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,660
has an organization called the and kick
in CCIC

741
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,598
national cyber critical infrastructure
commander something I don't

742
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,520
in CCIT and up they use some standards
as well internally there were 32

743
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,839
go to exchange data exchanges mostly
them something us data

744
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:42,299
I'll more than anything else and get a
free send it to them it just goes into a

745
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,960
black hole

746
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,970
knows what happens up reduce your day
with them on target basis

747
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,450
but I V thank you any other things
you've heard in the news so please I

748
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,910
think we're subject our

749
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:57,460
Mike Weir yes sir

750
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,140
yes up at a more limited role so the
question was able to do this in my

751
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,598
previous employer so

752
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:05,980
it's not a big cigar I worked but where
I worked was a place I came in to lead

753
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,660
into response after they had a

754
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,710
really well known in big famous popular
breed to be fine

755
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,859
LinkedIn makes it really obvious who was
up

756
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:17,630
and we were working on these things
effect because financial services

757
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,450
company which was a payment processor
the FS I second particular

758
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,009
a is getting is putting a lot of time
and effort

759
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,710
into doing the sorts of things among
each other because

760
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,589
banks and financial institutions in
general and they have a vested

761
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:38,339
interest in making everybody feel like
that whole sector is secure

762
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:41,660
because when you hear about a bank that
gets own you don't think

763
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,598
oh I have money with that bank I should
go over to this other bank you think oh

764
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,650
my god banks are in terrible shape

765
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,180
I which may or may not be true if people
think that so

766
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,919
this is why you don't see banks pic
eight other in public up hahaha they're

767
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,030
insecure and we're not

768
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,220
because they don't want anybody think
that the other picture to cure to they

769
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,029
want to be with them in other ways

770
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,550
up so I was not a bank but who had the
same sort of mentality 0

771
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,329
we want everybody to 50 have confidence
in credit card processing

772
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:11,690
right because that was to everybody's
benefit

773
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,849
a show as i've go around and talk to our
clients are just other

774
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,670
you know kinda organizations privately
there are a number of non critical

775
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,990
infrastructure

776
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,220
kind of grassroots organizations going
up for retailers are starting to work

777
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,520
together on this even though they're not
critical infrastructure but a

778
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,750
you know my wife is not a technical
person

779
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,760
but if you hear the department store got
our own she's not gonna

780
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,579
think I said no to that department store
anymore says nothing in my safe shop in

781
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:40,780
a department store for their offer any
kind of working for the same reasons

782
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,930
I'll just a few more minutes if you have
any other questions this is a great time

783
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,220
to ask them

784
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,240
if you think of them later and you want
to ask me

785
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:56,240
feel free yes man to get

786
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,780
in my well I will tell you what I am
pushing for house that

787
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,099
I am personally pushing for more use

788
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,230
love the sticks sigh box Mike

789
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,569
there's another one if he was called
stack from mitre

790
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:13,180
I think they done great work I think
there's a lot more work to do there

791
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,910
partly cuz I hate X amount I love Jas on
up

792
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,259
and it's a little bit kinda opaque when
you first get into it takes some work

793
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:24,710
untangle but in general I think

794
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,630
is my personal opinion don't repeat this
to rise in please my personal thing is

795
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,640
that way is the future because you need
context

796
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,640
and not just observables

797
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,210
what time for one last question if there
is one yessir
