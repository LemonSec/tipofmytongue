1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,509
I as we get started

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:09,349
%ah I you know the title says it all but

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:12,530
the that the tables pretty badass too so

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,270
I'm really looking for the stock I think
there's lots pace up front

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,180
if you wanna come up front you know see
some things a little closer wanna

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,430
um in CNN Yaniv the

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,840
have joined us from where G came from
the de mark and Israel

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,448
so come come from far to to share with
us today

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,610
a really looking forward to this we
don't have I don't think

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,230
any other hardware packing talks on the
Genesis a really cool

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,230
give them a big round of applause

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,220
from the store yet so we were thinking
that you know it's

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,950
a we were writing some series in the
password with expert stuff like that but

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,050
we think that it's

15
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,530
pretty nice and easy to XD hack stuff
with hardware instead of

16
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,750
no collecting all those 0 days so what
we did you collect we

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,229
actually try to build cheapest

18
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:17,670
a a hacking hardware hacking

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,800
pack so as you can see we have very
cheap ass down senior

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,030
some cheap equipment I those are

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,600
pretty old and pretty cheap I so

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,990
that's what we're gonna show you

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,229
yeah the spill 1 I'm some say adjusters
stop

24
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,690
next so

25
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,950
same thing here my nickname is le Mande
use also start

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,200
loss secondo so

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
that's our company that's where we work
at that's very sort of started that idea

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,800
for doing this hardware hacking stuff

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,890
so are

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,660
again what forget show you is hardware
hacking today so

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,539
not we haven't been any crazy stuff for
any special things we just collected

32
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:07,580
things that are you know ready to use

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,600
and we collected insists some sort of
package you can actually take

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,329
hack stuff so we can show you five live
demos

35
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,819
hopefully everything will work because
as we said we both really

36
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,369
cheap stuff so we're not sure

37
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,550
I'm just a mess and I'm this structure
things we use the word something

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,470
up souls because school rocks is a solid
results

39
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,280
so those are some things you need to
know her

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,990
that such their office so much in a
moment

41
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,090
from Denmark right should thank them
organized and like in the worst part

42
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,580
company

43
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,680
is still likes the south bronx and also
its that sucks right

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,290
outside your door really funny some type
soss

45
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,730
benefits or our officers so

46
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,649
author saying that talk is that makes or
screw or squid on

47
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,660
need those horse top 10 stuff that
they're always publishing

48
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,960
a we're gonna go with the harbor for
those things

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,380
up and we also think that those things
are pretty fast

50
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,790
so it's not that you know it will take
forever to to achieve something we're

51
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,579
actually using those things in our
fantasy

52
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,930
for do pretty fast pretty quick you
gonna see here that they're going to do

53
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,740
five things in less than an hour or so
that's pretty nice

54
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,890
that the small one on the way up

55
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,769
after the talk you can go back and check
the slices on information we're going on

56
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,540
really fast

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,590
his problem times against the focus on
the demos hopefully that will work

58
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,470
alonzo but there should be in the slides
you know very

59
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,960
itself to a information so if you want
to call our summers tools

60
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,440
or you some the cold stuff it's all in
there to take the slice of course

61
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,550
is winning over the sauce the first one
is about a

62
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,950
stopping for come to us up the step
elect

63
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,100
trust the site did night nice talking
about about

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,370
the long tail information security sup
at the beginning of the tailor to see

65
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,640
our throats some things that happened
often of Medicine of

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,529
happens all the time assumed all the for
courses

67
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,019
as less no spearfishing things like that
out but the business and boxers higher

68
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,830
problems we're saying the same Harbor
High stuff assault that's actually

69
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,690
and at the beginning of the tail is its
cheap stuff to do it quickly

70
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,780
action on the that much skill to do some
so

71
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,830
you know we're gonna show at the end of
the presentation again everything is in

72
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,609
the presentation gonna go real quick

73
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,870
and actually show you the demos and sort
of talking too much

74
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,669
I but our goal is that you'll get that
Keats

75
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,840
from the internet from different places
a and

76
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,960
our goal is to show that's pretty cheap
and it's actually working

77
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,030
so it's not just theoretical stuff that
you might have

78
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,500
could have possibly could use you can
actually use toast

79
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,750
saw one of my favorite to succeed

80
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,090
far it's a bit to amend their laptops on
how about

81
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,239
look at the corporate laptop public
house also

82
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,560
Faro Airport on a person or if you don't
how far are port on their watch

83
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
intersection I'll this out in an
interface

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,070
not simply by like up to some site or

85
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,430
he cites a scar went on princess what we
have physical access to the Sarver

86
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,370
spoken of the boss not been up

87
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,680
you know car dealers a far walk because
what happens is

88
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,250
future to stop so far fire our
connection to it so

89
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,470
back to missus actually have direct
memory access

90
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,690
which means you can read and write to
memory down

91
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,250
dust but also not because of you not to
conduct things to consider change things

92
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,340
to do dumb things

93
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,060
on top France's take some like to set
his ass right that doesn't cover rocks

94
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,780
to have in memory there's you can find
nice things like our numbers

95
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,210
up or just under speaking highlights is
password for prosecutors

96
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,320
if you can opt to not follower your
semester but the tolls

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,729
I can go on Sat so much mailstore the
best ever

98
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,900
to recall I sconce while smaller up

99
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,190
the total gonna show you today's policy
options my

100
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,490
this Norwegian guy call Carsten it's an
awesome so

101
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,240
in its ominous sings so some drivers and
stuff

102
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,440
but the good thing is akin much poll
most of the calm

103
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,200
most common sort of systems are fine on
a laptop right so gonna love them all

104
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,520
to a are some light them tensions have
you are ok

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,740
abuse number far more suffered too but
up or call

106
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,440
soon on the web so filtered of memory of
how it sticks on the laptop to knowledge

107
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,460
grout properly speaking the first three
do

108
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,810
sometimes of the four theory a if you
doing

109
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,320
number up on their laptops might have
Thunderball

110
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,590
a new spy if under water farther into
the same oxygen

111
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,560
talk some other box max a bit more lock
down the law

112
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,830
so it's gonna shock to hear as a

113
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,919
typical summer when the seven but the
Commission for the parts

114
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,719
doctor down to 0 it's configured way so
if someone found this mission turned on

115
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:16,719
would bring also though login page yes

116
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,409
here in the packet this mission here are
present this mission so sorry to hear

117
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:20,820
that

118
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,440
on this one 107 how much but look naval

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,960
you up

120
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,039
yeah see here such bolts

121
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,090
arts level and also that

122
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:47,090
their is actually password on this
mission go belts

123
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,350
so her Xolos like housework

124
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,580
or some

125
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,729
done with us or or so

126
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,970
imagine someone found out his laptop
found out on the wrong

127
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,430
were here for us page so the faculty

128
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,930
to Iceland's limits mission here up

129
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,180
this one doesn't have much to court so
can use since i cor

130
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,050
to up so we can get far more action
going

131
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,130
this here and its

132
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,360
like yourself have liked cheap stuff
like Italy what you can do so talk to

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,310
the man afterwards

134
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,890
for the swept up the show you want it to
look like after it's finished

135
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,520
because we have minimum of things that
we can carry service

136
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,720
the maximum allowance I actually know

137
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,270
skate in the in the no towards the end
but some stuff we had some issues with

138
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,590
some stop the thoughts

139
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,390
bomb sexually so by so

140
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,569
I can tell I've been in the room anytime
servers are ports been questions about

141
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:57,980
all

142
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,100
so so to minimize stop this discussion
of them you know the Paul

143
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,150
mucho of the boss and stuff don't carry
weird stuff like this in your

144
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,329
about something this is so

145
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,530
case about stuff though the victim
something up wrong

146
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,510
the summers ups in a row hopeful it work
something out you never know

147
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,470
so not so you know what it looks like it
but basically run a sub some

148
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,250
donde up how some nice so what's gonna
happen this is awesome I signatures

149
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,830
that election look look connector far
look for the signature and the day love

150
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,340
that this authentication that this

151
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,400
like it out is a bit too long any
possible

152
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,459
let's yet this

153
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,590
so when iran's also a letter

154
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,890
you have all this bars options like a
summer for Windows its

155
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,530
something mister X is was to you want

156
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,680
means stuff since next to

157
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,250
and also looking through 0 social for
though

158
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,740
about that signature into parts and
number

159
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,730
is not written reader writes whatever
what have a sexual assaults

160
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,020
down to of yeah I can tell you i mean we
do not come to sometimes

161
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,370
come across companies such as a lot of
time and effort to lost a stone

162
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,440
was interesting always test sometimes

163
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,790
even though they spend a lot of time
money to talk dial it still vulnerable

164
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,270
so it's always a good on its test this
skills I'll usually find that things are

165
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,740
not

166
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,030
as they should be or what's expected

167
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,339
so it's up to 100 hundred-and-some the
max source memory

168
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,990
seen those machines

169
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,460
be probably around 400-500 thats

170
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,160
are tests you know if if those are if
they're

171
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,719
mission will have like 16 gigs it might
not work

172
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,400
so what we're doing sourcing one of our
past pandas for stealing

173
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,420
sometimes for stealing laptops and then
we need to surf analyzing the office

174
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,449
what we'll do

175
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,530
is rex lee gonna take of 216 Rams

176
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,449
gonna shove their like two or something
and then turn it on

177
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,410
and then it's pretty easy because it it
I think limitations are on for geeks

178
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,069
with that tall so that's a nice you know
trick that we learn

179
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,660
nothing is because sometimes a couple of
the person for us reasons but the songs

180
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,040
again the subject an accident

181
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,010
saddam remember I want to have to
contend on lies in da Kazem

182
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,069
first things to get so in opa sorts is

183
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,060
stuff like up so actually I think of
sightseers la plaza

184
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,880
found signature pot stuff right so now
should be able to login with

185
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,880
like us or so it so what the two looks
likes of the schedule starts at a person

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,380
says

187
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,670
that's how we roll so

188
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,870
those are our stone those machines are
so all that

189
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,100
not to use the camera and to do that
attack

190
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,100
so know we're gonna turn on the camera
from that machine so here we come

191
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,680
I know upside-down check it out hello
everyone

192
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,810
here chances on the surface here

193
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,319
suit solar sadat's can have the
signatures looking for

194
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,940
about said yeah I mean

195
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,640
sorry guys but you can also come up
earlier basically

196
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,210
pot system every again over this or open
source tools such a stoner

197
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:35,210
just the steps of wonder what yourselves
okay

198
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:49,040
so we're moving on to the next topic

199
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,439
yes so the next one is his teensy I'll
probably some love you

200
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,490
actually heard about it from my point of
view

201
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,920
in our case in that specific
demonstration

202
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,020
it's gonna be like a very fast he worked
for me

203
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:25,060
so it can see it looks like that very
small device stirs

204
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,369
some hard real cheap some USB connector

205
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,420
and what what I like and it is that

206
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,800
it's very small and very handy

207
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,890
so what we're gonna do is we're actually
gonna program some stuff in it so

208
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,400
when I'm playing it meantime sheen it
will click Lee

209
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,590
quickly create an admin user on that
machine

210
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,850
on Windows 7 machine I

211
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,080
so let's say that you're sitting with
somebody drinking coffee or something or

212
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,420
somebody just want to

213
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,709
you know take a leak real week with
quick you can just plug it in

214
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,270
whites I don't know 10:15 cet: seconds
plan it out

215
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,710
you have an admin user on his machine
and of course it was lost

216
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,300
is far exactly a

217
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,420
so of course a program that small thing
you need

218
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,709
some app so you have for Mac for Linux
for Windows

219
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,980
and you need there are three know if
used 101 but doesn't really matter

220
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,260
some tip regarding coding

221
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,730
that's just some snapshots from the
column that

222
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,650
thing it's really really important when
your programming that device to think

223
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,079
like

224
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,570
yurman so for example if you wanna open

225
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,750
CMD in windows 7

226
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,260
you will have first to click on the
windows button on your keyboard

227
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:47,030
and then type cmd and then enter but if
you would like to do the same thing on

228
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,110
Windows XP

229
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,460
you have to press the Windows but then
you have to press

230
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,300
are because in Windows XP you have to
first go to the wrongful

231
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,079
and then you'll have to type cmd and
then and so it really depends when your

232
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,680
programming that thing which

233
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,750
OS you're going to attack and that small
things you know the

234
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,490
that they might mess up your call so
it's really important to think

235
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,920
exactly Mikey human being I'll

236
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,150
I'll just go to the demo so I have this
small teensy

237
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,150
I have this cable just help me

238
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,720
plugin but of course you can buy small
adapter

239
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,260
this cable is nice for the demonstration
so I'm gonna plug in one ounce

240
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,230
Roman on think saddam resources are
symbols of course you can put the slight

241
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,770
and I'll social just a mouse slept a
month someone dies

242
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,170
miles or some mouse nice abuse the rise
at them

243
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,660
like and the the work for hospital

244
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,740
on this law things so

245
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,460
I'm going to connect this one to one of
the USB

246
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,440
you and hopefully

247
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,240
it'll start executing stuff no my code
is not that good so it's

248
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,910
you know from you can do it faster but
we just

249
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,300
trying to demonstrate something so just

250
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,670
at user so now hopefully

251
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,589
I haven't show you that we don't have
that users will have to repeat that

252
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,610
yeah don't trust this guy in a while

253
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,690
yeah but this is SPOC win 7 I'm gonna

254
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:32,690
the limit now

255
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:50,399
so no we don't have this user you know
let you know

256
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,999
planning and see

257
00:16:53,999 --> 00:17:00,999
all working second

258
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,859
tussling with them all sometimes
sometimes artworks

259
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:17,329
so

260
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,710
as you can see hopefully yes so the yet

261
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,990
so now we have if you see Windows 7 user

262
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,710
so yes it took I don't like 30 seconds
probably

263
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,990
but you can write better code it's very
very quick so we plug it in

264
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,960
let you know if you have an admin user
of course you can do whatever you want

265
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,540
so you can

266
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,379
I don't try to Miller put it on it plug
n play it out

267
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,180
execute whatever you want so that's a
pretty need a little thing

268
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:48,480
you can use in Europe and festering
hacking I of course in the presentation

269
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,480
striking forward to buy cetera et cetera

270
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,590
you know how to program its fellows

271
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,669
yeah this was a different parcels you're
probably

272
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,840
thats yet that's not the newest wonders
different versions you can also attach

273
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,330
some

274
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,520
add-ons on it so it's really nice a but
that's that

275
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,450
again that's cheapest one that we got

276
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,570
that they have in that regard so the
next thing we'll talk about

277
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,340
are fighting much more promise someone
guys in the room how will such a card on

278
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,090
the right now

279
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,610
is all companies will use of some sort
of RFID physical control

280
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,229
mechanism so controls from yet another
the buildings or

281
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,430
all but the funny thing is like some
others

282
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,800
I'll implementations action offer secure
some sites security through obscurity

283
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,500
so also something here this

284
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,640
this public minutes or so you know it's
the folks in the song the low-frequency

285
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,230
carts 125 genArts responsible

286
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,470
undersized its ID on Honeywell

287
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,540
like you not to focus on this one
decided that support call me while I

288
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,060
know you guys have us

289
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:03,139
also loss in Europe that such

290
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,830
if you take a car option open top that's
what it looks like right there's a

291
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,909
plastic case

292
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,540
little column what's found

293
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,710
number this are possible carts what
we're talking about so the reader will

294
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,710
power the car

295
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,850
on the bad thing for us attackers

296
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,990
the reader parce car stuff myself are
close

297
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,990
to the reader or so though yeltsin the
researchers so

298
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,520
read the car but we want to stay or mess
with you we want to be a bit for what

299
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,120
some nice two billion of I wanna still

300
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,120
dollops hard times of its own you know
be like this not suffer

301
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,870
that's not normal behavior while for
some

302
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,439
all so the only look up

303
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,030
look at the Sox it so the ProStart
stories similar it's been rough for many

304
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,250
many years this one we can look up house
up for it to be about

305
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,920
sounds are only obsolete

306
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,799
16 bits are just for them the case
that's what you have in there

307
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:07,160
this option 0 slide

308
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,000
have on their such like this actually
something called the facility called

309
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,360
its then have your some serial number
for the car

310
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,549
so we what's read your car get this

311
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:21,668
this information thumb is switched on
the replay yet or

312
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:24,970
flown a new car news right now

313
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:31,970
to a the way it works is you can get
something like this

314
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,429
again I actually didn't bring up because
it looks like this

315
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:40,020
on its bills so for a question regarding
the TSA

316
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,230
so want to have their socks it's
actually

317
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,100
size about like an old LP director like
about twelve

318
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,309
in spite of Parliament's also actually
some video sequences

319
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,350
looks like but you have versus
reader/writer none here output

320
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,699
we go on for miles this Colts or these
bits

321
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,960
they go in so this little here

322
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,620
is an art we know that selection receive
the bits too cold

323
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,699
said St cart no

324
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,320
about assistance is when they

325
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,659
when they open the subsys to say words
are Frankfurt Frankfurt airport's

326
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,059
they differ suspicious writes i cant up
in this room spinning target some

327
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,809
brings us with many more let's play some
video some it would be more fun taxes so

328
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,770
it's a yes but hopefully you'll see the
videos

329
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,040
out to go back to a bit so this option
I'll

330
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,700
thats or I mean you can pretty much just
any art when it was

331
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,080
use this one from micro sixth inning
arts

332
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,740
musafa balls this laptop on your battery
popped

333
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,330
imports that outputs go to this little
SD card

334
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,389
reader/writer received information I'll

335
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,690
summit when I can go through all this
week and protocol second you can read

336
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,650
about that but it just

337
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,669
what comes out of the reader supports

338
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:00,890
line high and then when that some state
up

339
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,090
concept I'll sorry to read more what up

340
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,730
Iran as its up interesting a season
serious

341
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,669
to say front frankfurt's so we actually
call this front closet so dumb on

342
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:17,929
rights so let's show you here

343
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:21,070
now some videos its again apologist

344
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,149
accounts would've been better to show
the real thing about I'm fed up being in

345
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:31,130
the world so the first one gonna show is
actually

346
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,140
reading the tide just its

347
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:43,140
to have some this mister

348
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,650
which enough so minus as well said you
can hear the

349
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:55,650
you know wanna routes that are thats
here

350
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:10,179
lives

351
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:22,250
that's it of yup

352
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,549
doubts about so the summer distance yeah
I mean we have much to me

353
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:30,820
in our seats while all better actually
get about for insists right

354
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,470
guess pretty nice second I'll somebody
to some like something like this right

355
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,419
you can actually put

356
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:39,460
this reader in a bag or something so
much if we want to read or

357
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,440
still your your facility calls and
survivors if you guys are sitting like

358
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,750
to know

359
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,549
captain or something things as a walk
behind you we can stun

360
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:50,750
elevator 100 the Saints also here

361
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:57,750
i'm talking about

362
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:07,559
start from scratch sis here someone

363
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,178
house about salsa what's your the she
hot dog cart in our pockets

364
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:16,419
the sparse on how something fun and
about

365
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:23,419
comes I

366
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,860
other stuff

367
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,840
so awesome top about the tide are the
bit output the saw

368
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,830
said on this or so I can how so they
kinda the workflow since the whole

369
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,040
sorta works so what we have as well

370
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,480
we love this sort of up yes

371
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,110
stuff Scott's

372
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,070
so here what we're doing we just have a
rushing so nervous use

373
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,919
threats that %ah right sincere that's
the facility Co

374
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,280
outside and its number about

375
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,060
now spin valve by the reader so it's the
cold by the Swan

376
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,260
say from the start so goes here the
Colts

377
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,100
saves here and I'll have it hooked up to
one of these couple of tops

378
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,840
debug mode second see here but that was
actually doing stuff

379
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,240
I'm going up take out the car

380
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,410
so you if the amount that there's a file
called car klutz

381
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,650
what's up at Sonar thats

382
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,490
my favorite nail polish by the weather
where r myself

383
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:42,840
dances

384
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,860
mount thats

385
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,070
see here that's the cordon file here's

386
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,149
what's being maddocks are

387
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,240
also have another slice here's one oxy
capture

388
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,280
roles his mother wants to have this
information you know deliveries played

389
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,000
all stocks

390
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,400
or long though with our favorite
prosecutor

391
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,740
percentage

392
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:16,740
year

393
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,668
what's I just use the next

394
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:31,239
Microsoft so about

395
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:35,309
soul this is coming representation about

396
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,059
those fits Isuzu disconnected to support
this under some said

397
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,539
this here's a preamble up the should be
other

398
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,599
far since on the web 44 their other ones
like 37 bits

399
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:49,609
sores 36 pits stars parcels

400
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:54,139
so this here but the good thing is that
this is a pretty obvious

401
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:57,689
you can just up read the specs this been
all

402
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,529
wants to know how many bits out this is
no so then you know that this will be

403
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:02,309
the site's cold

404
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:06,139
and this is kinda some the serial number
that's right before it's about swype

405
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:07,029
this is very important

406
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:10,190
so once we have that information never
take on this

407
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,489
Russian colours and program our own car

408
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:16,839
rights with the same dead I'll or

409
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:20,229
better will bring it but there's
something called approx mark 3

410
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:23,239
worry too much emulate the tops right

411
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:28,579
with us emulate the talks American fun
things the Skyrock ActionScript

412
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:33,049
brute force numbers once have the
Pacific specific orders from the same

413
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:33,979
for the facility

414
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:38,109
and then the numbers are often very
tight together 701 cart

415
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:41,408
me for the see all you might not have
access to the Sapporo

416
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,799
but if we actually start find numbers in
that same rains

417
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,529
we might get lucky and actually a box
some rooms while

418
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,919
so that's what is here so all the Saw

419
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,469
its own by the sayings or so that's the
law

420
00:27:56,469 --> 00:28:00,809
are okay no

421
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:07,809
gonna do switch

422
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,379
we haven't No

423
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:55,860
which is

424
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,860
so

425
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,350
okay so next thing

426
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:13,279
is the key loggers yes

427
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,940
so probably most vino

428
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,260
keyloggers I you know you can see in the
movies that their

429
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,750
sort of plugging into the keyboard and
putting it behind a computer and then

430
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,260
the recording with a ridah

431
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,960
person is typing so that's nice but

432
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,250
a you know a lot of things we saw in our
pen testing some banks for example

433
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:39,710
I you don't type the password will give
you sort of virtual keyboard

434
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,570
and you'll have to click on it with your
mouse and then if you wanna still

435
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,590
for example that person's pass for you
can

436
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,590
irregular keylogger you know with the
USB or ps/2 keylogger

437
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,350
because you will not see anything is
pressing on stock which is most

438
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,820
so that was in the past so

439
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,730
we're seeing the future of killers are
actually the screen once

440
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,809
like this for example that's for a VGA
and you can see that the meet them

441
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,340
nicely you know in the Fiji

442
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,389
in for example blue for VGA and then you
have white for DVR I and late for HDMI

443
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:17,789
I am and those things we actually

444
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,149
bought them in

445
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:22,478
poland I think there's two things at the
end

446
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:25,690
so

447
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,759
the screen loggers will actually capture
every now and then

448
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,669
the screen and then when somebody's
actually clicking with smiles for

449
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:34,789
example or like

450
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:39,169
doing a lot of things that you can see
not throw the key word

451
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:42,999
you'll see them here so

452
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:46,049
just for us you know secret documents

453
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:50,700
contracts I'll an essay talk about some
map its

454
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,809
certifying okay

455
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:57,330
so you wish we gonna see them of this
one's pretty soon

456
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,970
and other cool thing that we have is dis
this

457
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,269
type of keylogger and actually

458
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:08,249
a you can seen here there's actually two
keyboards

459
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:12,320
one of them without the ski locker and
other one with

460
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,939
so anybody can see the difference here

461
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:22,159
Yes No okay because there are no you
know you can't really see

462
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,669
it's inside so it looks pretty nice one

463
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:28,849
when this thing is in there and what
happen is that

464
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:32,369
it's actually monitoring what are your
typing on the keyboard butts

465
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,840
internal so you know even if you're
dealing with some

466
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,759
a of I don't know bank or some some sort
of government stuff for

467
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:43,950
you know that people have some sort of
awareness and they will soar check to

468
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,710
your computer

469
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,460
every day or something like that it will
not help them with those kinda keywords

470
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,580
and we also some time since those
keywords is sort of gift

471
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,720
you can send them as a gift to our
customers or give to somebody

472
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,429
he'll say okay that's nice and its you
know

473
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:02,950
a so we use those tools

474
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,080
of course all the details are in the
slides you can get them later

475
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,859
how to you know actually mounted inside
so it actually looks like

476
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:15,949
like that's here's the key logger in
here again they'll

477
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,470
open keyboard

478
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,910
mutually cut some some wires near

479
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:27,760
in there and that's in you just need to
close it nicely I of course are some

480
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,710
serial key loggers that we're using
that's also nice for like printers or

481
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,510
like for

482
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,510
some sort of for credit card devices
will also because sometimes

483
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,330
up love carter also top so point-of-sale
something

484
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,389
actions obvious I compliance

485
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,960
not it doesn't say that it shouldn't
religious if it does the scope assumes

486
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,320
after another war but we actually fine
find hard times you can get some nice

487
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,149
card numbers

488
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,550
some this car for most because reducing
in of

489
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,909
card it up so those are really nice so

490
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,370
demo so what we have here is that key
logger so that

491
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,379
red part is actually for attacker

492
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,400
so when you need to read the information
from the keylogger you've used up things

493
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,030
will put it site here

494
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,530
so we have this this machine you see
here

495
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,970
and then we have another victim machine
with the seven victims seen here

496
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,990
so we gonna plug that victims into that
screen

497
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:28,650
and we will open some secret documents
of course

498
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,960
for the secret but its not when you're
done

499
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,300
so were actually funny like that

500
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,399
it looks like a regular you know VGA
cable

501
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,830
then replug it to the machine

502
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,659
interest we see this and Denmark or
staff member this model

503
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,670
most corporations nice busy over the be

504
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,320
annoyances sprint with an HDMI tonight
from those

505
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,980
that's a very nice place put this that's
where on the server

506
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,590
presentations about naw what their funny
that's a good place

507
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,100
so capital so sure if

508
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:11,100
see yeah okay because I don't about now

509
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:18,310
now

510
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
so

511
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,940
no

512
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,960
its let's try to change this

513
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:44,960
this

514
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,919
okay so we should have some

515
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:57,919
here yet top secret documents you d

516
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,170
DOCSIS noting give us know

517
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,780
okay

518
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,990
so I am I'm I think it's configured to
take snapshots every like a

519
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,180
thirty-seconds yeah so we will wait

520
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,940
a bit up but I'm gonna show you while
we're waiting for its takes effort

521
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,800
because that's the way configure it

522
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,850
I is that you can get

523
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:28,259
those here they have VGA DVI once

524
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,690
HDMI they have a lot of other cool stuff
also the USB regular ones

525
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,150
up that's actually how to

526
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,420
do how to plug that thing into a
keyboard so

527
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,510
those are actually better pictures I

528
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,980
just open the keyboard thats very nice
user guide

529
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,560
I and of course you need to remember PKS

530
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,950
those are the letter states use or to
press seem intensely to get

531
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,060
output from that keylogger element
default

532
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,779
yet default wants of course you can
change them yeah

533
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,330
okay so or say

534
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,460
sure it right now thirty-seconds yeah

535
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,800
hope it took some system you can rattle
config file

536
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,300
so specify how of just say stops also I
think

537
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,320
resolution so ok now I'm gonna

538
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,470
disconnect its and I'm gonna take this

539
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,549
add-on buying it in the US be here

540
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,620
and then just

541
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:36,620
like it in here and that should be like
a USB mass storage device

542
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:50,160
Hill so of course is to configure file
you can change you know the

543
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,560
you can change it could take snaps as I
think up to five seconds

544
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,230
causing also also for the boring ones
though the keys for bloggers

545
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,770
his number over from different countries
is important to have the cracked

546
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:07,240
male is no good Dennis they'll five
types a polished

547
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,399
itself so she can figure that they are
victims

548
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,550
mopping up with his folks so that's one
of our snapshots you know when we're

549
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,800
configuring configuring thing

550
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,329
other one sure enough time has passed

551
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:27,500
probe didn't

552
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,030
you can see the image you know finish to
write it but

553
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,599
sorry yeah

554
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,099
it could be from could be from

555
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:45,400
earlier but but that's how it's going to

556
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,400
look like and of course then you can
still some nice documents and password

557
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,740
course you probably if you want to steal
a pass for you to configure it to take

558
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,089
snapshots faster because in here

559
00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:00,029
I think I waited a minute so it took
like this screenshot

560
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,770
while we're fiddling with the screen and
then make

561
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,270
half a screenshot or something trying
starting to

562
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,619
right any salsa depends on the machine
those again a very old ones

563
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:15,180
so their ego the city cue over Swan

564
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:22,180
now to or less about I'm its losses
following orders

565
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,579
just still owe or to get like documents

566
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:33,470
loss interested house course okay so the
next time we have is our little friend

567
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,910
for the caramel so again

568
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:40,230
love you know what this case is a slight
number fax service

569
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,760
we're talking like that care to talk sir
casa karma sucks the

570
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,650
really nice almost like an in divorce
wardrobe because what you doing us

571
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,890
you're signing up an access point having
to connect to do right

572
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,180
especially sought to have us here like a
little about for

573
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,328
up with the battery park residents
frothing about

574
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:01,760
on what's happening in this such a
running car my like susser

575
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,730
I guess it's own stuff 2004 you know

576
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,799
wrote that so it's too not us but letter

577
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:12,190
I'll so what up this one come around sir

578
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:17,010
if you have a person that's been
previous connection access point to my

579
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,000
save data from Mesa right so

580
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,059
when it's our mission start probing
govern access for the home call them on

581
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:23,420
my

582
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,450
wifi all we got to the airport playing
on turn on a mission

583
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,259
my sock program for my wifi router and
this one the same

584
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,510
yes it's me given IP address and then it
connects the writers were

585
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,250
very nice or have to shin-etsu on

586
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,309
up there's a bit of history of man it
started

587
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:45,390
you can to use some something small like
this I'm themes are using this

588
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,490
or outsource you can also use like to
knock down

589
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,709
and one I'm that's the pineapple those
sold for a while

590
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,960
an hour here with us on so this is a out
121 you

591
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,730
0 now

592
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,700
stuff about the fun thing is forced to
oh yeah

593
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,808
so what did you do is you can either buy
this quite expensive we suggest more fun

594
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:13,829
you're more like a hiker out also found
that sucks that by out the roster

595
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:17,480
yourself Jerry just bit it's a serial
connector a chance

596
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,000
floss but that's what it looks like
expected here flash device yourself to

597
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,940
some constructions

598
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,930
we put some stuff which I'm not go to

599
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,190
like each this others that the missus
structures

600
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,640
clusters of don't oppose you'll have
this nice little do it

601
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,000
we can I setup toxin to stop a a watch
the running it now really

602
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,539
in the label all it will do is somewhat
connects it will do

603
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,660
enough's given of powders within us
moving whatever type in

604
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,038
gets a bit ninth house one sec letter
disconnect that is funny when you ask

605
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:51,890
the audience

606
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,190
western accent no answer one sec the Los
or so

607
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,599
lot of develop next all so

608
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,049
up that's kinda looks like someone here
so if you have the sort about her

609
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:06,630
practice on us actually quite long list
on our site so it's also about walk

610
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,339
around and then HM

611
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,700
helped this one such an ex-member 232
phone or something reaction have

612
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,200
internet you can solve it all

613
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,379
and it's actually quite nice his number
of corporations

614
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,700
people will have their smartphones maybe
they're not allowed to touch

615
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,029
are corporate email on the smartphone
but this time do

616
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,130
but maybe there's no wifi there for them
to do if

617
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,770
if I walk around with this and sorrow
internet other public ok in a lot of

618
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,910
people

619
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,660
so that were like in the middle and I
were to do things like as a some

620
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,390
strippers

621
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,098

stuff like that just don't buy it from

623
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,529
at five that's not good now some
experiences about

624
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:49,359
up so the demo suction it's also

625
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,480
this mission here suckin X Commission so

I'll the wifi so Robert

627
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:02,109
this has been like all over the place so
probably was gonna happen is up

628
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:05,890
it's one-stop probing for a access
points what's been previously

629
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,640
out this will say yes that's me

630
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,390
sound connects its

631
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:19,720
so whatever network your machine will
prove to

632
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,009
that should answer yes that's me connect
through me so

633
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:28,599
yeah anybody connected to that on
anybody get like an ice cats

634
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,640
on the screen yet prestigious it

635
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,980
so I'm actually connected to assert some
London Heathrow

636

00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:06,880
to solve them long style

641
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,799
you select also the ones who are in the
past and it's all of them are available

642
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,660
