1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,689
are twist on it is that we're constantly
assessing this here

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:09,340
security of those web sites at all hours
of the day 24 by 7 football scanning

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,590
technology and also human review because
we can only test for about half the

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,670
things that a a

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,650
have them on a boy's gonna be tested for
appeared outta me the fashion so we find

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,890
the bar though is we verify their
accuracy

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,109
finalist business logic flaws and report
them to our customers

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,920
and they get the data and nice web
portal so they get kinda near Rio

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,340
real time %ah view other web security
posture they can then import those

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,440
result in a web application firewalls
GRC systems bug tracking system

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,440
you name it so that's kinda the idea
what this view

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,349
gives us is a view into who's vulnerable
to white and how often

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,559
it's a really interesting way to look at
web site for the Billy

14
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,940
cell that's the premise here

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,120
I get the study web security nonstop in
this is a

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,149
this is the history and secure web sites
right now are the number one reason for

17
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,280
breach data loss and Mauer propagation

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,719
or very close to it as anybody disagree

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,680
on sure took a well

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,860
it don't take my word for it i Kyrie the
same secure ports you do

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,950
and I read everyone I could find and
then this is true according to you

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,780
basically every industry bridge report
that I'm I've writer that's available

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,020
for the last five years

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,060
and I get asked about this all the time
because you know there's nothing

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,740
terribly knew about sequence action on
these exports

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,170
you know that we haven't seen the last
five years nothing across its European

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,280
then I'll service they're all pretty
much we all know how this stuff works we

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,090
know what they are

29
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,490
and know how to fix it so why do we
still have all these bridges so there's

30
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,309
three reasons we can consider I'm gonna
focus on the third one but one as

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,299
the web is really Bay something I a
little over 670 million web sites out

32
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,520
there so there's a lot of buggy legacy
web code out there that we're cleaning

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,869
up

34
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,689
on Gemini Germanic origin as we're kinda
like the Internet Security janitors and

35
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,298
all our

36
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,340
I but a misallocation

37
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,490
there's about a billion dollars being
spent or so and web security when he

38
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,820
threw everything and but about $12
billion spent on antivirus

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,669
I would like to see more the money spent
on web security viruses don't get there

40
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,378
to begin with

41
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,590
third is the best practices are

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,140
industries letter with so called best
practices things like

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,839
developer trainee I like I

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,590
SecureCode code review security
frameworks Q-eight St and web

45
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,160
application firewalls and the like

46
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,379
I do not believe in our history there's
any sacred cows and eyes

47
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,970
and ice and I try to blow up all the
preconceived notions all the

48
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,920
conventional wisdom out there with data

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,958
so this is I found this quote a couple
years ago and it kinda finds most of

50
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:42,530
what I do

51
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,709
are the research that why tax I have
about 250 terabytes web security

52
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,920
vulnerability data

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,230
when you can measure what you are spread
speaking about

54
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,299
I can express it in numbers you know
something about it when you cannot

55
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,519
express it in numbers

56
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,209
your knowledge is a meager and
unsatisfactory kinda may be beginning of

57
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:00,700
knowledge

58
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,260
but you have scarcely in your thoughts
advance to the state of Science

59
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,329
I would very much like that very much
not want to be

60
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,550
one of those security experts at this
doubts the stuff without data packet and

61
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,720
that's what I find most to the

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,040
industry is that they'll say here do
this best practice and if you press on

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,390
Mac

64
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,708
and say can you show me some data some
evidence

65
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,110
some study assessed why this works
weathers developer training web

66
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,569
application firewalls or whatever the
case may be

67
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,940
our industry has a very very little if
it that's not

68
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,180
a thing but anecdotal data song back
into the stuff socks like pretty harsh

69
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,500
stuff so I mention we assess web sites
all the time

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,370
so we get to know how many for delays on
the average on the given website we have

71
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:43,620
a

72
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,560
historical trend on it way back in 2007
we are fine and

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,379
over a thousand different discrete for
abilities per website

74
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:54,540
get my bridge time frame I can't tell
you how weak out this stuff later but

75
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,540
these are serious fault these are not
like you're missing SSL

76
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,510
or your are a complete turn you know
turn on your forms you don't have a

77
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,929
security fight now these are ones that
exportable that make you headline news

78
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,030
and has been getting better website to
meet any more secure

79
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,830
at least the ones that we're testing our
are all the way down to 56

80
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,330
at the end of last year so the average
website at about 56 describe our

81
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:15,790
abilities

82
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,988
per year I can break them down by
industry

83
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,549
you know the average percentage of all
horrible sights on that call on their

84
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,490
you see that say the adverse also

85
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,600
eighty-six percent the social networking
site at least once irresponsibility

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,169
a hundred percent in the manufacturing
date on average for all counts

87
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,639
remediation rates are covering a reading
of 50 to 60 percent

88
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,669
50 percent to 60 percent the phones we
find

89
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,150
have been fixed that's it I would like
to see the numbers in the eighties and

90
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,530
nineties if not higher

91
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,090
but also want to take a look at the
average time to fix is there

92
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,299
1 I've always found wheat our customers
everything about it

93
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,900
what it is what it means to them
severity what that has to do with a

94
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,789
where it is and how to fix it's their
job to fix it these are custom web

95
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,460
applications

96
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,680
falls these are not see the stuff they
can fix for the patch

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,110
it takes our customers and these are the
ones that really really care about

98
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,960
security otherwise we wouldn't be there

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,960
it still takes them weeks to months to
fix these issues on average

100
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,310
this is the top 10 or our top 15 as a
2012

101
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,650
54 percent on the web sites we tested
for add at least one instance of

102
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,870
information leakage 52 percent had at
least one instance a cross-site

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,710
scripting

104
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,799
but here's the one tiny bit of good news
and web security that you're fine

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,280
you see a little pink down there in
seven that's equal injection that's the

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,940
one that gives us

107
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,789
all so much pain it actually is no
longer and our top 10

108
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:45,729
as far as pervasiveness actually dropped
out used to be 15-20 percent in years

109
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:46,599
past

110
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
but I guess bag has been forcing the
issue s now dropped a number fourteen so

111
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,820
things are getting better

112
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,479
ice but if that there quickly if you're
in the banking sector retail sector

113
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,909
Francis in our report

114
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,080
we have our industry scorecard so if you
happen to know your stats you can see

115
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,000
how the rest of your industry is doing

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,780
take it kinda compare yourselves out
there it's kinda like interesting why

117
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,780
another piece today that I and II like
this is not white out there this is

118
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,169
what's the data from the web

119
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,930
packet into the database cuz I wanna
know not only what the bad guys could

120
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,949
exploit that's the stuff that we find

121
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,620
but what the bag has actually do exploit
and the web hacking into the database

122
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,130
kinda gives us some insight into that so
that big blue bar there's

123
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,210
you from new stories we really don't
know how the website got hacked

124
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,710
17.55 the incidence out there according
to the study

125
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,919
is done our service and 16 or 17 percent
or so in the bottom left there

126
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,139
are single injection but we still get
I'm a little bit about cross-site

127
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,259
scripting

128
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,370
so that come with the bad guys are
exported so it's two different angles

129
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,870
now I can tell you I like I said who is
vulnerable to what

130
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,800
how often but until recently I could not
tell you

131
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,970
what impact training had on our customer
base if they did try and

132
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,139
and did it happen impact if they did
static code analysis if it had impact

133
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,310
lass web application firewalls if they
had an impact

134
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,599
no one could tell you if this stuff
works

135
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,509
because we don't have the control that
we only have outcome data so what we did

136
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:15,849
about nine months ago so this consume
nine months of my life

137
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,330
with that I did a survey of our
customers 76 organizations responded

138
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,210
and I asked them about 13 questions
about the Apple case a good program

139
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,159
questions about what they did on gonna
smash all this down to a bunch of

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,479
questions but the one

141
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,630
I'm gonna point out because it just blew
are my only side

142
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,930
is that we asked our customers to rank
the drivers for resolving their core

143
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,849
abilities

144
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,650
the multi colors are by industry but it
just focus on the blacks here for the

145
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,750
time being

146
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,259
their number one driver for are to fix
bought it might have been compliance

147
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,220
corporate policy Rex reduction customer
partner Matt and so on

148
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,500
the number one driver to fix issues

149
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,259
was a for resolving on abilities was
compliance 3.19 just a ranking system

150
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,150
don't worry about the numbers are kinda
mean less but it's just a rack

151
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,030
compliance beat out risk reduction but
the tiniest fraction

152
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,258
so compliance is the number one driver
to fix vulnerabilities

153
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,610
we asked the opposite question because
again we saw

154
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,190
five minutes positive fast alright we
asked the other question is how

155
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,039
what cost you not to fix what about
discovery see it so happens a lot

156
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,259
so we ask the inverse question the
number one reason cited for why

157
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,530
issues don't effect was also compliance

158
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,949
compliance as it's been said is not the
floor

159
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,229
it is very much the ceiling if you want
to get done with compliance you're

160
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:38,969
exhausted in

161
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,599
have no more resources are calling for
anything else so that's where you stop

162
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,000
compliance is hindering us complied
Nexus get hacked have the data to prove

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,980
it

164
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,820
I asked we also ask our customers if
they've been breached

165
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,170
are out I if they've been accountable
this is accountability

166
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,029
about a quarter for customer said when I
bridge happens aborted directors

167
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:02,110
accountable

168
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,240
eighty percent said the security
department so there are some

169
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
accountability up

170
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,920
I mention brief operates a moment ago up
those 76 organizations roughly one

171
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,420
quarter were breached

172
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,269
seventy-seven percent were not we're
going to focus on the breach once

173
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:20,589
wanna go this real fast falling apart
four minutes right

174
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,380
so top part here this is correlation
between

175
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,060
training and if they've been breached
the companies that have been breached

176
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,449
are here and this is how much

177
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,890
train they've received in the collar so
up those they've been

178
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,459
have been breached 33 percent did no
training

179
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,810
if you notice your between the ones who
said they haven't been breaks

180
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,880
is there's no discernible change what
however much training that it is not

181
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,990
seem to impact their break statistics at
all

182
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,589
training does not seem to reduce a
preacher's

183
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,140
but look at the quote down here in the
bottom we compared with your abilities

184
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,569
organizations that provide instructor
later computer base offer security

185
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,209
training for the programmers

186
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:03,260
at forty percent fewer balls resolve
that 59 percent faster

187
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,230
but for whatever the reason exhibited at
12 percent lower remediation

188
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,430
back at just the one for ability to wear
that's the problem

189
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,589
I'll skip by that Frank that's a
application

190
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,279
frameworks their operates versus not
breach in if they've had a security

191
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,370
framework

192
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,350
doesn't seem any discernible difference
between breach but check the South offer

193
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,149
per hour

194
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,529
you know those that had a framework in
place had 64 percent

195
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,370
more vulnerabilities resolve them 27
percent slower

196
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,810
but they did demonstrate a nine percent
I remediation right

197
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,890
this is contrary logic but it's the data
but it says

198
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,230
how about static code analysis maybe
that makes a difference doesn't look

199
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,200
like it in the fridge for SES non great
just look like static analysis

200
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,149
healthy not get hot but those who do eat
static code analysis

201
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,200
on their underlined web applications for
whatever the reason they had 50 percent

202
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,320
more balls resolve them 26 percent
slower at a four percent lower mediation

203
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,459
right

204
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,680
with an office in the indictment up the
SC a space in general

205
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,890
or the products that they are using
question but for whatever the case

206
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,029
that's the numbers

207
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,959
and the last 1 I'll give you hear is web
application firewalls

208
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,029
no discernible difference in breach data
Web Application Firewall the point they

209
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,140
had 11 percent more balls

210
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,930
resolve them a percent slower and at a
seven percent lower remediation rates

211
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,229
from

212
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,350
this is craziness right so what we
started looking at the date on which

213
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,370
such a spot check in stuff we cite

214
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,700
clearly cuz theres customers for getting
no guy from the stuff

215
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,690
and clearly there are some that are and
somewhere in the middle you get an

216
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,399
average like this so there's something
else going on here

217
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,079
I'm gonna try to find a cure for

218
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,329
so quickly I'd drivers these are drivers
number one drivers Cup

219
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:03,630
company corporate policy matters a lot
but I'm gonna jump here

220
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,750
this for one moment here

221
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,610
I'm gonna jump down over here if an
organization experiences a website or

222
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,000
a data breach and the part of the
organization which is held accountable

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,380
so we compare

224
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,889
accountability to breach we found a
chart

225
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:25,389
that's a huge amount a difference the
ones that were breached

226
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,690
where the ones that had very low
accountability

227
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,060
know what the organization was
accountable for the bridge

228
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,518
the ones that said they were accountable
they did not have a bridge

229
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,040
so there has to be accountability in the
organization and there has to be

230
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,880
empowered to do something about it

231
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560
that's where you get all these other
charts like here this one here

232
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,459
number one driver for resolving for bill
is called our corporate policy

233
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,810
number one that's the reason why the
driver cock management says we have to

234
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,800
fix it

235
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,810
that's how this stuff works for the two
it's not a technology property

236
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,229
with it's an organizational incall and
cultural issue

237
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,600
so out to make sure I finish on time I'm
gonna

238
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,360
go far some lessons learned in your more
than welcome to go to the size if

239
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,510
after or the report general

240
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,899
some lessons learned I do not believe
there's any such thing as best practices

241
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,209
and web security there's practices that
you should use if you have

242
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,500
a slower mediation right focus on that
one of your problem a single injection

243
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,990
focus on that one

244
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,470
if you have no idea what you're doing
and web security program

245
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,940
the of top 10 will serve you for your
first year it will not endure second

246
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,950
your or your thirty-year

247
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,959
you're gonna have to assign individual
or group that is accountable for web

248
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,329
site security specifically for breaches

249
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,399
they must suffer consequences if there
is a breach or something goes wrong

250
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,779
there's nobody around nothing nothing
will happen you must find all your webs

251
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,209
find all your website's all up and
prioritize them because you have to put

252
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:53,670
sufficient resources

253
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,839
at the ones that mean that matter the
most measure current security posture

254
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,300
from an attacker's perspective

255
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,500
that's the only ones that matter train
and track your life cycle upon abilities

256
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,970
anything measure tends to improve over
time fast detection and response

257
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,339
you will get hacked it's only a matter
of time with yet you know why that we're

258
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,699
no different in that regard

259
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:15,699
see wanna be the first ones to the
tactic not the last 12 don't want

260
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:16,779
something on the ongoing

261
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,339
what's up here and you want to be a
response to these incidents and

262
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,620
that will keep you outta trouble so
that's a at fifteen minutes a web

263
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,870
security

264
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,500
the German us so the the size of a size
be available

265
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,050
yeah the okay now so everyone if you've
been asking questions about the slides

266
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,699
will

267
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:40,609
have them put some of them are already
been posted but I will get them are

268
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,970
posted you know no later than a week or
so after the conference
