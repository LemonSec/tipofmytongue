1
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:03,570
all good afternoon

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,770
and thanks for have me up your first few
minutes

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,379
my name is Tammy and I'm a sales
engineer that work so at Birmingham

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,580
I initially thought this was going to be
a karaoke competition so I wasn't quite

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,340
as prepared

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,850
but thankful to god it isn't and you
don't hear me sing

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,960
op gonna just give you a brief overview
of

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,160
wrong %um and who we are what we're
doing I'm so

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,160
very quickly on the on the slide here
the thing I want you take away from our

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,150
slide about

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,050
we r where we come from is that two of
our co founders other

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,459
the two co founders ups and source same
source being the

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,610
hypervisor technology behind vast
majority of the cloud services like

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,989
Amazon Web Services and Linkedin and so
forth combined with our other co founder

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:46,870
who is a up

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,110
was a principal at Phoenix technologies
BIOS company

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,140
he's the guy that has sorta the idea to
bring this all together

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,239
I'll you saw yesterday if you attended
the

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,328
the conversation prestige myra cool
about how to break

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,809
Sam boxes and what's wrong with sandbox
technology we've got some very

21
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,979
sophisticated security people took over
as well

22
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:10,400
so and of course me any the

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,509
the the company is without with the
product now since the followed last year

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,610
and as you can see we're not that old in
terms of the company but yet we're doing

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,830
some pretty impressive things

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,929
the thing I want to highlight if you
look through these I'm not gonna read to

27
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,250
you

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,799
up but is the bottom one just because
this is a particularly interesting story

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,630
NSS Labs has a history of course and we
all seen them do their tests for

30
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,949
intrusion prevention

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,500
farrell's right different product and
the reason I pointed out is

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,640
they tested our product for Endpoint
Security in the same with a test all the

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,990
anti-virus tools that they've tested the
first product in the history of this

34
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,890
space in this testing to ever pass with
100 percent accuracy every test that

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,470
they did

36
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,380
when I get through this presentation you
understand that if we had done ninety

37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,240
nine percent

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,699
we would have failed because of how
we're doing what we're doing

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,280
it's not about detection is on how fast
we can write signatures it's not about

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,079
that files

41
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,179
is a completely different approach and
for our approach to be legit

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,729
we need two hundred percent on everyone
these text test but we'll get back to

43
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,830
that as we go

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,319
alright so let's talk about what we're
talking about we're doing are

45
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,160
core product is called the century and
be centuries purpose is to eliminate the

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,879
infection so from our on the endpoint

47
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,569
we do so like completely reversing the
process

48
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,819
of over really what we've been doing for
some time which is the the constant

49
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,410
pursuit

50
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,780
through the forms of signatures and
heuristics and potentially even

51
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,660
anomaly detection detecting or
whitelisting blacklisting Witcher

52
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,390
different forms of detection two-degree
on the idea here is where first

53
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,670
starting off by tackling the key threat
vectors that you see listed here

54
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm we do so in a similar sense when you
first hear what we have to talk with it

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,640
wasn't like sandboxing

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,230
you can imagine after yesterday's
presentation really don't want you to

57
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,540
think it was his hand clutching

58
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,569
sandboxing in a layered approach is

59
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,859
hardware software offering system
sandbox

60
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,900
and many applications in the sandbox as
a whole pointed out

61
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,930
if you make calls to a phone mobile
operating system the sandbox does

62
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,980
nothing to help you

63
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,480
other tools my coming to try to detect
again detect

64
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,780
the attack is coming through but again
as we've discussed the road a

65
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,440
kernel exploit Sandbox is pointless
further

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,440
the sandbox itself their life detection

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,440
multiple applications run inside the
sandbox locations until something the

68
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,280
Texans is all

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,260
somebody did something in the sandbox
with dump it what we're doing

70
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,260
is micro virtualization we're taking Zen
we're taking the brain trust of our co

71
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,359
founders and we arm

72
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,629
taking its incredible architecture love
multi-tenancy

73
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,298
like Amazon Cloud web services and we're
putting that on the endpoint but instead

74
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:50,420
of customer a

75
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,589
customer being customer seeding
virtualized and kept apart from each

76
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,049
other

77
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,319
we're doing it for at six browser tab /a

78
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,480
doc pdf USB stick is in its own

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,329
micro virtual machine and how this
distinction the sandbox

80
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,430
well members applications

81
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,409
sandbox operating system Park its
hardware

82
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:16,209
micro visor then operating system and
applications

83
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,738
we are virtualizing the kernel a kernel
level exploit cannot get out

84
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,520
0 are micro virtual machine we are being

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,280
able to enforce this through we're gonna
get into it and I should be advancing my

86
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,299
slides here

87
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,440
really getting weak the way we protected
we enforce this is true the hardware

88
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,759
when relying exclusively on software and
the and the

89
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,050
behavior they ran relying on the
virtualization extensions within the

90
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,530
Intel processors

91
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,539
as well as other processors but today we
focus largely on the Intel Core i3 i5 i7

92
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,660
gives us the ability to do
hardware-based virtualization on the

93
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,070
endpoint

94
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,400
the hardware enforces that the barriers
in force is also excellent some things

95
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,580
that we do

96
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,949
because the purpose here is for it to be
seamless

97
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,639
when I dem away I have to do all these
things to make it on CMOS you can see

98
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,360
what we're doing

99
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,840
but when we're actually implementing
this the purpose of it is that you

100
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,919
browse the same way you browse you open
the docs the same when you open up

101
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,330
word attachment and and you resume send
in your HR folks

102
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,990
the opening read it but a weapon is PF
no weapons were document

103
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,130
or website with a in a drive-by from
JaVale

104
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,539
whatever it might be all of them are
occurring in micro

105
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,680
virtual machines we're gonna walk
through how that works so here's our

106
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,150
stack

107
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,330
traditional operating system on hardware
installer micro visor

108
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,419
called a microliter largely because of
where it sits in its footprint it is

109
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,479
essentially for all times per se
hypervisor

110
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,190
you traditional applications like your
CRM or ERP is in a trusted is gonna run

111
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,990
on your machine the same way around
before

112
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,360
back in a virtual i sat but we will
fertilize is

113
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,169
those key threat vectors I just
highlighted another slide so users have

114
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:48,659
a

115
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,470
be NCR each independent micro virtual
machine

116
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,319
whose barriers are maintained by
hardware clean the Word docs the PDF's

117
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,400
images the movies

118
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,150
whatever else for downloading so what's
going to happen when he's in particular

119
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,159
because this particular one was to
Facebook

120
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,000
it's got a facebook cookie that's
allowed to be there and has Internet

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,750
access that makes a lot of sense

122
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,870
what it doesn't have access to is our
intranet

123
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,880
it makes no sense but this one
particular task that went to Facebook to

124
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,229
be able to talk to my internet

125
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,719
see my username credentials information
in Windows be a look at my registry my

126
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,789
filesystem

127
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:25,949
and that make sense so as I can really
do that the flip side we have our

128
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,050
PDF that we've opened this PDF does not
need access

129
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,740
to the Internet therefore this my covers
wishing well I have

130
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,509
the policies that I'm describing if you
are in here at they're not to be

131
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,770
configured in the nebula didn't have to
build some big firewall list

132
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,590
its obvious it's the logical inference
that if I have a work Tacopina

133
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,448
don't use that word doc browsing the web
I'll use a browser to do that

134
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,699
but now we're on the other hand might
use fix so

135
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,080
those policies which define what
accesses or what what resources are

136
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,229
available what access is available

137
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,280
again they're in here and there's a
little bit of control you have

138
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,599
we're not trying to take control away
rather there's only a few things you

139
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,349
would ever wanna

140
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:05,199
be able to do here like to find whether
they can copy in peace between them and

141
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,009
define whether or not cookies persist

142
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,389
pretty simple stuff let's look at one
particular so we have a a microbial

143
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,430
if you were to implement this in the
traditional sense that every virtual

144
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,759
machine with a complete operating system
stack

145
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,770
you would need a lot of RAM to enjoy our
product but what we do instead is

146
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,630
utilize technology base that we call a
copy on write the idea is

147
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,740
you have this clean version of Windows
is your image that you built that you

148
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,849
already have a écrit image that deals
on the desktop to the laptop

149
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,569
and that clean image is what we build as
our virtualization mock

150
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:39,639
than every virtualize micro VL
references that

151
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,639
it sees it is though is the one we use
are a bit

152
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,620
and of course it's easy obfuscated based
on his policies and rules it doesn't see

153
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,520
your filesystem

154
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,770
your IP stack it sees a virtual copy
that's totally different

155
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,080
your your him but when it goes to make
changes

156
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,419
to those yes it's loading web pages it
he is in fact now where it's attacking

157
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,530
various things and making registry
changes

158
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,590
those are the things we have to track in
memory sore extremely

159
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,770
efficient with memory to ease my curvy
am they are the exclusive use of Windows

160
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,120
or Mac computer

161
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,190
but in reality of course they are all
sharing the parts that are redundant

162
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,330
and then they have their unique parts
that we track

163
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,719
the malware getting into one of these
and a drive-by

164
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,250
bad news but when we close the tab

165
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,330
gaw our remediation of our is

166
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,139
extremely a I'm sexy when you see it
from the end-user

167
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,620
points and everybody would happen never
solve an hour happen never saw any of

168
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,049
the

169
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,109
keylogger the job drive-by but the flip
side the IT side

170
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,500
you you get the picture I think adheres

171
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
the malware has nothing left behind
nothing

172
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,940
we dive back in a lil bit deeper because
there was only one task inside that

173
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,399
microbial

174
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,620
everything that it did is associated
everything we see all

175
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,040
attributable 100 attribution to that one
tax

176
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,360
so figuring out what happened and being
able to do in our analysis is as easy as

177
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,230
can be

178
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,920
so easy we actually automated so we have
what we call live attack

179
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,699
visualization and analysis because I'm
our helpful execution could

180
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,610
everything it wanted inside a micro VM
that couldn't get out couldn't touch the

181
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,810
things that shouldn't touch

182
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,060
we can produce an event for you call the
lava trace that walks you through how

183
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,920
the Internet Explorer then launched Java

184
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,149
ok and then basically dropped

185
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:26,790
executed file after file we have a
command control conversations every IP

186
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,810
address to be contact with

187
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,640
within the i'd the information that we
have here we also averaged be changes

188
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,519
and then when you look at the files that
were dropped we get the md5 sha-1 we can

189
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,450
feed this data

190
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,470
for standard format first X into a
variety of different resources that you

191
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,269
already have in our infrastructure to
look for these threats

192
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:47,660
coordinate on these threats

193
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,640
so the use cases I think appreciate for
those walk from real quick I'll

194
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,130
this is this is like wearing a big ass
when you go outside

195
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,480
and you browse the web it doesn't only
happen when you're inside your

196
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,550
infrastructure

197
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,769
when the endpoint goes to Starbucks vs
remains on you this is a big key

198
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:08,870
this this solve every problem in world
peace and your hundred no it doesn't

199
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,440
but it does mean you can browse the web
without getting infected technically get

200
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,519
infected all the time

201
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,649
but the infections have no value your
bullet proof when you're when you're out

202
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,930
this a huge thing is also see more so
that your end users do not have to be

203
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,660
to go and disable it or abuse or a
concern themselves with it

204
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,029
this is a big one remediation occurs
every single time they close the browser

205
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,470
tab when they stop reading a weapon is
PDF thing everyone who was affected the

206
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,010
first place

207
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,209
I think this one makes a lotta sense
patch for functionality rather than

208
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:39,819
security

209
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,680
after one deprecated Java right now God
have mercy on you

210
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,880
right but when you run deprecated job in
chromium:

211
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,089
there are no infections that occur
nothing last fingerprint keyloggers know

212
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,480
colonel access

213
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,040
you're protected and of course

214
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,209
the the part the most fucking excited
about the end user could care less about

215
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:03,290
the threat intelligence you now have a
proprietary security feed

216
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,860
think about that proprietary meaning to
you your image your users doing what

217
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,000
they do where they do it when they do it

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,300
that's produced from all the malware
that they touch but they never actually

219
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,870
infected from

220
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,329
be that in the year Sam be that into
your brain trust in logic understand how

221
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,800
your people are getting attacked in
targeted

222
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,370
are we seeing a just a massive number
weaponize PF's and are

223
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,510
recruitment HR area are we seeing your
contractor coming in this way

224
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,490
that's a sign that we have a problem
with maybe a layer a problem we've got

225
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,579
some human interaction

226
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:34,729
people targeting us it's not just random
drive-by

227
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,070
that intelligence is yours and comes
right at your end users instead of

228
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,870
buying a security threat feed that's
about the glow

229
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,180
those have valued on the wrong foot this
issue

230
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,359
so the business outcomes from this yeah
I think it's pretty straightforward

231
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,269
vs allows you to focus your efforts

232
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:55,680
in such different ways you're no longer
having to capture laptops and desktops

233
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,149
to figure out where the malware did what
it did was extracted

234
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,269
you know exactly what it did you know
that extracted absolutely nothing that's

235
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,839
critical intelligence there

236
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,940
we'll be out there the rest the day if
you have any questions come by but thank

237
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,100
you very much for your time today

238
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,769
really appreciate it
