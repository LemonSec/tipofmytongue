1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,959
thank you home maybe maybe saw a little
bit about me

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,580
as a salute to I was very very deep in
the security community

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,889
Iran Microsoft buzzing strategy toolkit
for about three years

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:15,899
a was at the point where I knew
everybody in the community I did some

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,220
interesting things there

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,270
little project Kobe exploitable is one
they're released

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,580
so for everyone to have an open source
project I do some crash analysis work

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,769
together with Dave weinstein I'm and

9
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,460
this community the security community is
really where my heart is what I've been

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,160
doing for

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,480
a very very long time I'm since I was

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,089
probably too young to really have been
doing it actually I remember the moment

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,010
a I was a hacking into a BBS this was in
the early nineties

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,870
and for anybody who did PBS's or members
from these all

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,809
like W W four terminals the software
that will host it kinda the pre-internet

16
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:54,379
days

17
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:57,680
and there's a really great escape
sequence where you could get out to this

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,839
hidden root account

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,260
and I used to use it to just crash my
friends and some these games that we

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,710
play

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,479
where i'd have like you know hours and
hours and hours of playtime

22
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,130
I just totally Russian but I was
watching CNN while I was doing this

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,649
and newt Gingrich bill clinton came on
talk about this telecommunications

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,180
act and I realize what I was doing at
that point was about to become

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,880
illegal and had a a bit of a reconciling
with that a young age

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,369
my father being a police officer in the
city that I grew up in I realize that

27
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,590
were right to be arrested that probably
throw me in the room shut the door and

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,990
deny that they heard anything

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,839
I'll but I came back to it is. but a
couple years living in the ukraine

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,189
I saw some very very interesting things
in the security space when I live there

31
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,710
that was the the late 90's

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,610
a mid to late 90's 96 to 98 and it kinda
rekindled my interest and I got back

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,679
into this as I got back from the
Ukrainian

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,009
and would work for Bell Labs &
eventually ended up Microsoft

35
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,590
but as my professional focus for the
last decade

36
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,310
really getting into understanding the
bugs finding the bugs during penetration

37
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,290
testing during policy work

38
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,929
really what what we all do I'll I tell
people in security to be affected you've

39
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,569
got to be a mile wide

40
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,030
and then you've also got to have a
couple areas where your

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,470
a mile deep as opposed to many
industries where

42
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,530
you need to have some your general
awareness a couple things around you but

43
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,280
your expertise is really what you

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,530
I get paid on we get paid to be experts
have everything

45
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,069
essentially and

46
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,510
I finish some things with causing those
looking at Microsoft an interesting

47
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,209
thing happened as a terrible interesting
thing together

48
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,160
i four children my oldest at that time
was

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,359
15 us now 17 but she had a stalker

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,629
on Facebook real guy I have

51
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:53,518
neighbor I an uncle to love the
neighbors she was friends with and I

52
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,760
went about the process

53
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,319
%uh trying to get this guy

54
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,190
like one of Facebook and to keep my wife

55
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,340
from going all sicilian on him with a
baseball bat and in the process of doing

56
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,069
this

57
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,510
I realize that the a Facebook process
for

58
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,530
reporting was very i'm for filling and I
had no idea what was actually going to

59
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,080
be done

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,720
you click that would click this little
link that point I was how to change now

61
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,540
and you submit that hey there's this guy
and I think there's this stuff going on

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,730
and you clicked ok use quicksand I was
yet

63
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,500
there wasn't like a we got it there was
a noble follow up with you

64
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,890
there's nothing like will I i kind of
feel okay about that so I reached out to

65
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,569
us you know some guys run over a
facebook cuz we're all one big happy

66
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,238
community right we know each other and
they had them do their investigation of

67
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,720
the security side they would talk to the
frog eyes are like

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,920
this guy crossing lines and they got
kicked off Facebook

69
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,179
I came out without thinking with all of
my understanding and knowledge in the

70
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,319
security space

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,409
I had no ability to protect

72
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:04,209
my family the controls did not exist

73
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,470
to actually keep that

74
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,959
data about my daughter controlled

75
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,790
any way shape or form and I as a parent
couldn't see who her friends were unless

76
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,089
she gave me the permission to see who
all over friends work

77
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,989
now that have the same time as the being
security men in our Privacy Manager job

78
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,130
came open

79
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,940
I would too the guy who I knew was
hiring for the job was the security guy

80
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,960
and I said like you don't wanna Privacy
Manager said I'm hiring a private matter

81
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,099
said no no no

82
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,479
you wanna Privacy Manager you one
engineer

83
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,949
you want someone who's gonna help
engineer your way out of these privacy

84
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,919
problems

85
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,159
is this really what we need that's
that's what I'm gonna be talking to you

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,410
about today

87
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,310
has been the last two-and-a-half years
actually now as the Privacy Manager for

88
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,940
being

89
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm they were gracious enough to give me
a couple people to work for me now to

90
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,479
help me out with it cuz I was

91
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,758
the Privacy Manager for being but also
taking the two

92
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,050
spaces security privacy I brought them
together into one

93
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,160
and so on running lead for the security
privacy team for

94
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,470
OST when I went to make this switch

95
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,400
there was some concern people thought I
had lost my cell phone was on a vision

96
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,969
quest for something

97
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,740
I a member Mike Arrington I write speech

98
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,860
ID'd he kinda you know he's a big guy
like many kinda puts hand on my shoulder

99
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,360
and he's like Jason

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,330
I try to talk to these privacy guys want
to last six months and I ran screaming

101
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,359
said are you really really sure

102
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,720
and I said yeah a really sure up because
not only did I see the issues for myself

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,520
and my family be able to protect my own
but I understood

104
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,299
also that it privacy was increasingly
becoming a problem

105
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,820
for technology and as we move into the
cloud as we moved into social networking

106
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,289
and as we moved into the spaces it was
going to be

107
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,550
much much more problem and a security
where the guys who like work on a lot of

108
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,360
the controls to fix the stuff

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,500
and actually I think we're one of the
only group with the right understanding

110
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:17,150
and knowledge to be able to solve some
of these problems

111
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,489
so we have this a lot of things that are
happening right now in the

112
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,069
technology area we've got our digital
persona

113
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:27,759
out there that we're projecting and
we've got

114
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,229
you know that's kind of who we are we've
been doing that email IM and chat rooms

115
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,340
and whatever and

116
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,400
maybe in a chat room it would be okay
for me to wear a skirt cuz who knows

117
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,799
right up but then

118
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,880
it's all coming together with physical
location and data about

119
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,530
you know everything I'm doing we've got
all this meta-data now the talk about

120
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:46,909
the other

121
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,039
an essay and what has made a day to mean

122
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,159
right and its all in our pocket

123
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,560
everybody's got a mobile device I'm out
of anyone's been to a third world

124
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,139
country lately

125
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,020
but you can see children literally
digging for trash

126
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,650
through the trash for dinner and they'll
have

127
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,870
on iPhone knock-off so even though they
don't have

128
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,050
shoes or food to eat they still have a
little a mobile device

129
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,099
and that we've actually got data that
shows that in Africa as an example

130
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,030
as we give this technology to cassava
root farmers

131
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,280
victim triple their annual incomes just
my understanding

132
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,448
where the best prices are today force on
the roots

133
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,940
and so we're seeing this massive scale
out of all of these things

134
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,169
and there's huge opportunity we're
talking about literally as I say here

135
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,380
the slides hundreds up billions of
dollars

136
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,270
up new markets they're gonna be produced
by this confluence of data in this new

137
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,198
world

138
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,910
and as we move from two billion people
online

139
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,509
about where we are today to by the end
to this decade

140
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:59,120
we'll probably be looking closer to five
for seven billion people online

141
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
I kinda depends on how quickly Africa
parts of Central Asian things pick it up

142
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,870
but that is there is an enormous amount
of data that's new from a group of

143
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,310
people who didn't grow up

144
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,509
like many of us with your children are
now with the data

145
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,560
with technology now

146
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,729
we all know I'll when you have

147
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:22,490
lots of data there's good that can
happen but we like to do a little bad

148
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,560
to rate we get that that desire to make
bad things happen

149
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,940
that's what we all try to have stopped
the security community maybe we don't

150
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,610
try to stop depending on what side

151
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,490
were on but we've got some players out
there

152
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,560
in the technology space there may be a
little edgy now I'm not poking fun

153
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,050
at any of my competitors here on this
just so happens that

154
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,060
a couple of a microsoft's competitors
well one my competitors comes up

155
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,290
in this commercial but in Sioux
illustrate a point

156
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,769
love what this new technology we can do
for us

157
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:03,250
friend and I just had the best for state
I think he's the one

158
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,529
and now with my and repair phones from
virgin mobile email the pics I talked to

159
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:08,399
my mom

160
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,580
and with unlimited data and web can go

161
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,730
yes to even what is force protection for
patterns

162
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,480
sweet when settlers in my tricky seeking
for another red lips to keep me on my

163
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,040
toes

164
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,579
stay in touch text tonight and he hasn't
responded I know is home

165
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,260
with unlimited data and web on my
Android powered phone from virgin mobile

166
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,319
I've got tons to do only persistent
extreme

167
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,940
taking on Foursquare my gosh me here

168
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,470
France closing it's only twenty five
dollars a month

169
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,670
it's Kristy thanks do you

170
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,290
creepy my favorite line there by the way
is

171
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,560
former Gus on the beer brats closet I
awesome

172
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,239
perhaps essentially they're showing

173
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,670
to show off their feature set there's a
new look with a great start for you can

174
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,130
be

175
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,079
this is so fantastic and it's true that
we're really

176
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,279
I looking at that kind of technology our
pockets and as we will get access to

177
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:13,949
that data

178
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,819
they could follow everything that we do
there's a lot of concern around that

179
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,010
because there's a lot of concern around
that

180
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,819
people are noticing that that's
happening so here we have senator Al

181
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:23,399
Franken

182
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,069
I store member him from his Saturday
Night Live days

183
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:31,439
but he's done a very good job being
taken very seriously

184
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
at this point and he particularly is
taking up as his main

185
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,050
issue as a senator digital privacy

186
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,569
and here's a quote from him that I think
really sums up where we are today

187
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:45,649
but I think there's a balance

188
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,290
a balance we need to strike in this
means we're beginning to change the way

189
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,660
we think about privacy to account for
the massive shift of our personal

190
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,490
information

191
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,130
into the hands of the private sector
because the Fourth Amendment doesn't

192
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,730
apply

193
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,910
to corporations the Freedom of
Information Act doesn't apply

194
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,170
to sew a convent so you think about that
for just a moment

195
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,120
essentially what senator Franken is
telling us here

196
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,540
is that individuals have

197
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:24,089
little to know recourse in the case that
their data is stolen or trodden upon

198
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,149
by companies to the field its toll
Freedom of Information Act

199
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,260
gives individuals corporations whatever
the ability to go and

200
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,459
petitioned the federal government for
information about something that

201
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:36,040
happened

202
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,110
are you can ask for information about
yourself about

203
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,319
you know things that you might be
interested in 911 tapes love

204
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,779
you know whatever happened and and so

205
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,420
you there's some recourse right in the
fourth amendment is what that's trying

206
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,939
to protect the fourth amendment

207
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:52,939
is reasonable search-and-seizure which

208
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:55,969
says that the government can't just walk
into your house

209
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,959
and take you for absolutely no reason
maybe Patriot Act Two side maybe not

210
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,760
right a but in technology

211
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,319
the recourse is not there and the
protections

212
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:16,319
are not there but why is this our
problem in this room why is it a

213
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:18,180
security problem

214
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,689
the landscape is changing dramatically

215
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:25,269
we're looking at laws

216
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:30,519
that prohibit polling data from
countries back calling data

217
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,110
from one place to another up

218
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,880
technically taking information from
Europe

219
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,579
and bring it to the united states would
be a violation less or the safe harbor

220
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,079
agreement that we've got a low

221
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,239
illegal to export reading about Chinese
citizens

222
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,189
from China all that mean for you know
any company dealing with technology at

223
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:52,469
all

224
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,930
if you have a website you have Chinese
users right does that put you at risk

225
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,149
for the problems they're

226
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:01,519
a India just passed a bunch of laws that
are pretty broad and sweeping

227
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,550
I in the last year or so

228
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,910
and we do have some these agreements
that allow us to bring the data back

229
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,370
but the penalties for these they sell
alright

230
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,290
now I know you've all been Sony to death
right so we're gonna kinda jump through

231
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,110
these couple slides here a policy of
another presentation a little bit

232
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,550
up why did people

233
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,569
care about Sony being attacked we all
know

234
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:32,279
that there were a lot of breakdowns that
happen for Sony to be played the way

235
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:32,930
that they were

236
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,040
and it was kinda some activism that was
involved right they went after this kid

237
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,689
who

238
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:41,010
up routed the PlayStation

239
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,540
3 and side like that and so they
Suderman so anonymous

240
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,209
sony's for you and just hacked and
hacked and hacked and hacked the crap

241
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,949
the reason people cared those because
they were losing data

242
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:58,059
that's what we're protecting that's why
we're involved in this

243
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:03,620
is we're keeping access to data I kind
of control

244
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,130
more than that though the penalties are
going op

245
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,559
at crazy rate Google's find twenty two
and a half million dollars

246
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,069
I just last year for knowingly and
willfully

247
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:19,729
bypassing a major in Safari for privacy

248
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,050
now that argue whether or not it was
knowingly the FTC said it was

249
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,189
and they let me define Vegas fine ever
levied by the FTC

250
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:32,300
I'm made up people have done the
calculations their online about eight

251
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,959
minutes of

252
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,660
search advertising those done right and
so

253
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,329
in the European Union and this wasn't
the last week as a little further back

254
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,979
a US judge in california produce all men
against Facebook for $20 million

255
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,220
we got these multiple tens of millions
of dollars now these are the first time

256
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,269
releasing these kind of damage is being
word but the European Union they're

257
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,010
saying this is a slap on the wrist

258
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,160
for multi-billion-dollar multinational
companies so they've now got in the

259
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,199
European directive

260
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,800
the ability for Member States to find up
22 percent

261
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,429
love gross domestic revenues

262
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:12,370
for a company for a single privacy
infraction

263
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,380
and theoretically that could be applied

264
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,809
for every member state you

265
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:22,799
talking about a single event that could
make more type

266
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:29,799
billion dollar international companies
go out of business

267
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,269
and it's a security problem

268
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:39,399
were actually miss characterizing I
believe privacy and security

269
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,260
we're not really talking about privacy
and security we're talking about risk

270
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,250
and when you're talking about risk you
have several sides to it

271
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,649
your policy and you have engineering

272
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,230
for the most part in privacy

273
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,610
you have policy people lawyers

274
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,040
I know I speak to lots of them my
lawyers are

275
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,849
very important for me in my role as a
Privacy Manager

276
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,699
as well as the other privacy managers
around Microsoft about 400 people

277
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:15,229
work and just privacy Microsoft

278
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,260
but most of them have understanding

279
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,610
or degrees in and around law and policy

280
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,720
on the security side though mostly
engineers

281
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,250
where ones and zeros were hacks where
compilers

282
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,949
we talk about how to resolve problems we
talk about liking the fussing space how

283
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:38,579
to go and find problems on a massive
scale

284
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,059
and is this legalese versus techno
babble kind of

285
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:47,209
in injunction we have we can't
communicate very well

286
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,920
because well lawyers don't understand
are techno babble

287
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,229
and we have very little tolerance for
legalese

288
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,029
it so we can to shut down I don't listen
so well but

289
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,709
on the other hand I can tell you this
because I went in there the privacy

290
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,399
expertise that you have

291
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,010
or the security expertise you have new
carry is a big stick

292
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,220
in the privacy world as a security
expert when you hear a privacy

293
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,419
conversation

294
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:16,470
and you think you should contribute

295
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,280
I'm telling you you should because
you're more than expert than you think

296
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,418
you are

297
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,049
so how many people here have thoughts
and beliefs

298
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:29,830
around like first amendment freedom of
speech stuff they're really

299
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,928
ingrained right I certainly do
second-amendment

300
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,340
absolutely I'm their fourth amendment
for sure

301
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,600
all over me as a matter fact we can get
really passionate about solve those

302
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,330
right

303
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,918
those or what the privacy community

304
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,260
are trying to protect are those kinds of
constitutional rights

305
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,639
and where the engineers they can help
them do it

306
00:17:55,639 --> 00:18:00,010
when we offer up solutions they will try
to implement them

307
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,050
and by the way was billions of dollars
just sitting out there waiting for

308
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,730
privacy solutions that are reasonable

309
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,440
so I took after about a year doing this
privacy thing

310
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,870
um and wrote out kinda how I look at
this from a code level

311
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,080
I get the first thing you want to use
define a problem if you actually gonna

312
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,460
go about trying to fix it

313
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,730
for me an online service is a Microsoft
which is being MSN and advertising

314
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,040
data is the lifeblood up the business
without data

315
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,850
we die if there is no privacy

316
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,770
consumers don't trust us and they don't
give us data business was away

317
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,899
right these are absolutes the privacy

318
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:48,080
execution ability today is last the
privacy needs today which is less than

319
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,908
the privacy needs tomorrow

320
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:55,590
everything's moving to the cloud
everything's going managed

321
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,689
and what are you talking Java or C sharp

322
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,800
its all moving to man is in fact a lot
of

323
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,580
respectable computer science programs on
even teach C&C was close at this point

324
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,310
they teach

325
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,540
job in c-sharp

326
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,950
and a developer is not and should not be

327
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,330
or should not be required to be a
privacy expert

328
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,590
so that means that we have some other up
some other things we have to consider

329
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,879
sofa look at how we want to start
solving this problem right we have to

330
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,709
look at the these definitions

331
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,960
I the main body that i've seen

332
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,980
I kinda internationally that really
knows we're talking about privacy is the

333
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,340
International Association approach to
professional

334
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,709
driver Trevor Hughes is the president on
he goes and he gives the stock that's

335
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,220
really interesting

336
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,649
and he says that there are 11 different
definitions and privacy

337
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,689
anonymity is the one that most people in
the security community think about

338
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,260
initially when they go and

339
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,940
I'll like the confidentiality right is
another one

340
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,990
the CIA model

341
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,280
but if you have something that people
understand eleven different ways it's

342
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,090
really difficult to start to try and
tackle that problem

343
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,879
at all and if we go to the dictionary is
not that much more helpful

344
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:11,550
the quality or state of being apart from
a company or observation

345
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,610
seclusion so do things in dark places

346
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,678
whatever freedom from unauthorized
intrusion

347
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,050
it's a right to privacy was being talk
about yours right

348
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,408
we'll talk about that moment a place in
seclusion

349
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:31,370
secrecy a private matter secret

350
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,500
and and so we see that even here we have
these

351
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,809
you know there's this this idea of
intrusion there's

352
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:40,889
being a outside observation

353
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:45,469
and there's this work right no privacy
is also very different as we go from

354
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,360
country to country and as we go from

355
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,790
culture culture up those first second
fourth amendment rights that I was

356
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,610
talking about for americans that

357
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,370
most of us feel very very strong over

358
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,459
um when you move to Europe those

359
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,800
privacy is one of those rights they look
at privacy as

360
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,800
a fundamental human dignity

361
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,700
the same way that we view the first
amendment the freedoms a speech

362
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,840
europeans largely view data privacy

363
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,629
their ability to control data about
themselves going to other places

364
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:22,580
now there's very good reasons for this I
was having a good conversation outside

365
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,949
yesterday about this and it was pointed
out it's true americans are other young

366
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,619
country

367
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,100
we've been at this for a couple hundred
years in Europe

368
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,550
those countries have been at it some of
them a shorter time than

369
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,070
us but most of them have been at this
for

370
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,830
hun many more hundreds if not over a
thousand years for

371
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,369
us a particular areas

372
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,119
and we can see violations of privacy

373
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,678
in the past on this kinda canonical
example is used in the privacy community

374
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,460
love the atrocities that happen in world
war two

375
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,610
the Netherlands had a very very

376
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,959
tight understanding all where people
lived in what their ethnicities were

377
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,700
and if you look across Europe the
Holocaust was

378
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,639
they put in percentages it was more
effective that it was even and

379
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:16,580
Nazi Germany weather looking at it
eighty plus percent

380
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,540
extermination which is awful as opposed
to the race that they have Germany which

381
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,908
were much lower

382
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:25,200
because the government understood more
about the people who they were and where

383
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,809
they lived

384
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:32,210
therefore Germany actually kinda
epicenter approached the private world

385
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,710
and for very good reasons we have loss
of life and when you have terrible

386
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,580
events like that it sends two hours

387
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,040
stick in the memory

388
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,899
so the first thing they actually need to
to start thinking about this is a

389
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:48,580
as a security person is a language
lesson

390
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,610
armored I'm gonna put some up some my
charts up here

391
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,350
where personally identifiable
information that's or personal data

392
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,908
in Europe this data that allows for a
data subject to be tied

393
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:06,119
to a real human being on that we've also
got prominent concern

394
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,800
and sorry I'm just looking at my time
here alright prone to consent is

395
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,250
a the consent to the user's given to
collect data and user license agreements

396
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,550
privacy statement retention requirements
actually know what you have to be

397
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,260
experts and yes

398
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,809
its all pretty basic its all pretty
logical

399
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:28,990
then there's the enforcers is that the
people who make sure

400
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,470
that companies are doing the right
things with data

401
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,480
we've got Federal Trade Commission in
the United States

402
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,530
article 29 Working Party in Europe

403
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,070
so the way that legislation happens and
in the European Union is very different

404
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,889
than the way that legislation happens
the United States

405
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:49,129
they have the European Union which
creates a directive says here

406
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:54,600
is a base principal that must be
incorporated into your

407
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,070
country's laws by XD and then every
country goes off

408
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,520
and a I'll they work to make those

409
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,110
those lost power love their I'll

410
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,219
apart other countries kodak's a

411
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,300
what's interesting about this is article
29

412
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,590
is the European directive

413
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,990
for data privacy and human rights

414
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,470
again we see this follow-up to this is a
fundamental human dignity

415
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,840
this is and we're getting to this point
the United States as we've seen more of

416
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,300
these breaches happen is people asking
lots of questions about you know the ANS

417
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,710
is

418
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,760
actually doing with the the Snowdon
files they came out things like this

419
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,570
with data protection authorities this
kind of a generic term issues largely

420
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,559
across Europe

421
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,250
Canada has their own privacy
commissioner there's a lot of reason for

422
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,010
Ceres

423
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,809
actual enforcement on their spines

424
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:54,520
as we saw 20 to a half million for
Google $20 million for Facebook

425
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,869
we're talking real numbers with lots of
zeroes here the potential for billions

426
00:24:57,869 --> 00:24:59,129
of dollars

427
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:02,980
consent decrees a I would actually state
that while

428
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,919
Google was required to pay twenty two
and a half million dollars is probably

429
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,970
going to be much more expensive for them

430
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,440
over the next 20 years to prove to the
FTC that they're doing

431
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,200
privacy by design than that twenty two
and a half million dollars

432
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,270
I will be interesting to see a

433
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,610
cost analysis on done at some point I
doubt it'll

434
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,139
ever be released personally very
expensive Victoria

435
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:30,408
a Microsoft had his consent decrees also
expired for the reason they were under

436
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,129
another one so right now for

437
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:36,510
passport that have about 10 years ago
there's injunctions

438
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,200
Google's actually being blocked from
implementing their new privacy policy in

439
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,220
Europe right now

440
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,190
there's injunctions are in place or
legislators are

441
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,460
actually a judicial branches are telling
technology companies

442
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,510
you can't change

443
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,690
and technology is very fluid and so

444
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,990
you can't be fluid you know what does
that mean for technology

445
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,040
so here's what you should really care
about

446
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,440
having a little bit in the background ok
it's on the players some other pieces

447
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,899
involved is the translation from

448
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:14,699
security and privacy we get really tied
down

449
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,210
in the 100 sometimes we see that really
elegant

450
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,030
overflow we we see the bypass that
allows that

451
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,850
are that Roop we see these things we get
excited about because they're cool on

452
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,620
their fun

453
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,840
you know they're really hard to find and
there's a lot of technical know-how and

454
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,709
subsequent to that we respect up

455
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,140
but sometimes we need a poll up a little
bit

456
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,659
right on in security we talk about these
vulnerabilities we talk about

457
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:44,450
exploits we talk about payloads when we
go to

458
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,600
not just the privacy community but also
exacts and the people who write the

459
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,269
checks for the work that we do

460
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:55,340
we can up a level that to talk about the
actual consequences

461
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,220
data leakage unauthorized use regulatory
action

462
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,580
mitigations we talk about medications
and fixes

463
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,699
I'll on the security problem on the
security side

464
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,850
I in on the pricey side again were
largely policy

465
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,519
so we can actually recommend technical
vacations and solutions

466
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,390
and we can bring those to the table in a
way that people working on this policy

467
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,740
can talk

468
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,269
and automation I my biggest friend is
automation

469
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:28,010
we're kind of lazy has actually been
proven human beings are engineered to be

470
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,169
lazy

471
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:32,640
thats has gone what were built for if
you listen to any after the Millers

472
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,950
falls in talks

473
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,190
Hill almost always say well I when I did
this work and I figured it out when I

474
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,240
was lazy so I built a father to let go
and find all for me

475
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,659
right automation is the only way that we
can

476
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:48,440
actually accomplish these things with
all this data if you look at just my

477
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,260
dataset

478
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,019
for being on we're approaching XO by did

479
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:56,059
goes terabyte petabyte

480
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:01,080
exabyte so a million terabytes of data

481
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,330
lot of data and it's got a lot of stuff
there with a chronological copy the

482
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,039
for several years as well as the way
that a lot of people

483
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,929
interacted with and the only way to
manage that data

484
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:19,929
from a technical perspective is a lot of
automation

485
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,740
so a call those buzzword bingo because
it is but these are like actual real

486
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,470
problems

487
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,490
people say big data I have an exabyte
data actually know what that means

488
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,340
up

489
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,659
but everybody cares what Lady Gaga she
wants the rights

490
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,559
to her Twitter followers and sources no

491
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,240
thats our data it's not yours $31
million people

492
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,520
we're talking about follow Lady Gaga and
she doesn't get access to who they are

493
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,050
without Twitter saying that the camp %uh
the last presidential race

494
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,360
came down to who manage their data
better

495
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,830
and there's been a lot love up a lot of
press around you know the

496
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,629
republicans now wanna get better about
how they are managing the data because

497
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,980
the democrats were way ahead of them

498
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,020
I was either with the first Obama
campaign as well they were just much

499
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,410
better about handling their data

500
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,610
and it may have made the difference in
who was the president also everything's

501
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,300
in the clout

502
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,559
um if you do something

503
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:24,559
online and I I hope and I assume that
you all know this but it's gonna be

504
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,280
there forever

505
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,340
anything you do online leaves a
footprint rocks

506
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,169
and it will never go away and also the
on ramp to the cloud is changing

507
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,850
are in the media and the press the talk
about the post-pc world

508
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,550
what they're really saying isn't that
PCs are going to go away

509
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:44,240
maybe that's what they think they're
saying it doesn't assessing the PCs are

510
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,990
going away saying that the primary

511
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,150
interface with computers is changing
dramatically and they fit in our pockets

512
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,960
and they have from Mendes processing
power

513
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,120
and they have what's a memory and their
always online and you know where we

514
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,800
are the No word doing they tell us where
we should be

515
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,889
when we need to be there and when we're
bored sitting in that doctors office

516
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,250
they let us play Angry Birds

517
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,880
at so they're going to this technology
and best friend in our pocket at the

518
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,590
same time

519
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,699
think what you will about that I'll

520
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,460
and I've got some numbers up here about
2.4 billion

521
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,220
internet users today and nearly half
love that is

522
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,580
on mobile devices to come up with some

523
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:33,580
put some scale others another
presentation I give our talk about

524
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,720
the change that we've done into

525
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,350
that we've gone through into at the
Mobile World in into the social world

526
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:40,870
all

527
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,379
still something from that really quick
and and make a %uh

528
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,550
a statement i think is probably very
true this is this is Jason pontificating

529
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,149
because if the adoption curves that
we're seeing on mobile and smart devices

530
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,220
and we're seeing on mobile broadband
it's probably within

531
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,370
this decade that we've seen nearly every
human being on the planet

532
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,530
capable of making their own decisions a
ten-years-old

533
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:12,410
plus will have a mobile device think
about the ramifications

534
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,020
think about that technical issues that
that's going to bring to us

535
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,210
and think about what that means that
we're protecting and how we need to

536
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:19,750
protect

537
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:25,200
this is why privacy is our problem we
need to implement

538
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,250
and create the solutions that are going
to

539
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,910
in naval those people to interact with
their computers safely

540
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,210
interact with their mobile devices
safely and store that data in a way that

541
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,610
they're going to feel okay about

542
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,760
everyone watched deviance talk yesterday
fantastic talk by the way

543
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,669
in very well done I he was talking about
a couple of applications

544
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:50,070
in the you can use in android to make
your Android device

545
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,639
more secure they were privacy enabling
applications

546
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,030
when we talk about security

547
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,879
in the mobile world yes there are
overflows

548
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,890
yes there are the technical things but
what most people

549
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,929
mean when they say that is they

550
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:16,860
don't control 30 we can fix that

551
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,770
we can take pragmatic security solutions
and we can apply them to the

552
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,090
the same areas static analysis is an

553
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,350
are that we understand that we use I'll

554
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,219
we can take that apply to personally
identifiable information I was having a

555
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,960
conversation with someone else I'd like
to try and identify all the social

556
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,910
security numbers were looking for all
patterns have 32

557
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,580
for numbers and we're getting
ninety-eight percent junk

558
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,760
right we can get better than that we can

559
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,010
contextually figure out what's in those
things are in transit data texan's

560
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,080
another way to do that

561
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,710
we need some more like we encryption
mechanisms

562
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:58,240
one of the a canonical examples that I
personally use

563
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,540
when talking about taking security
solutions and applying them to privacy

564
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,659
problems

565
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,310
is a taking

566
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,690
I least privilege I well understood

567
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,120
well-known concept in our sphere and

568
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,409
applying it to big data so this
privilege says

569
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:21,740
you can or only access the data you
absolutely need to access to do you drop

570
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,130
you control tackle it down and make sure
people only have

571
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,030
you know certain access on the big data
side well what if you only collected the

572
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,520
data you

573
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,260
actually needed I know what to do group
up privacy experts

574
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,550
I started talking about this like oh my
gosh you're a genius

575
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:42,610
as posing yes yes I know hurts like hell
no you understand right this is a solve

576
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,810
problems

577
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,550
and this is what I'm saying we actually
have solved problems that were

578
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,760
that we can transpose over the primes
world again

579
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,340
there's billions of dollars on the table
saw all these things

580
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,560
so as we really look at it again the
security community

581
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,780
is uniquely able

582
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,280
to identify and helps all

583
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,070
these privacy problems all we need to do

584
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:16,560
in order to do that is up level the
conversation appropriately

585
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,690
and then bring solutions and mitigations
the problem Guptill tools

586
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,909
a automatic army the response in the
processing of the data

587
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:29,399
need to be aware above the cloud as we
do that

588
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,549
we're gonna be pragmatic um

589
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,940
I was talking to my dad a while back and

590
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,350
a funny thing happened to both he and I
about five years ago

591
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,609
as for various reasons on my I was
living a place for home owners

592
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:46,659
association is about seven years ago

593
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:49,450
and he was also living in a place with a
homeowners association for various

594
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,189
reasons

595
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,740
neither was a really attended the
meetings and so

596
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:56,529
about the same time you started
attending the meetings where he was

597
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,359
living

598
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,940
in near Colorado Springs and I started
attending the meetings where I was

599
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,460
living

600
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,820
and the Denver area and

601
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,150
just speaking this really pragmatic
language or reason

602
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,440
people like what is this magic and
before I knew it

603
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,500
I was the president of the board before
and he came in and started doing the

604
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,590
same thing just talking

605
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,410
like reason like here's the logical way
that this works here's why we should

606
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,250
care here's what we shouldn't care about

607
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,880
he found he was the president his board
also in about two months

608
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,570
as we bring practical solutions to the
table which we have two

609
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,790
right we were the underdogs for really
long time and security

610
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,630
and we have to be really pragmatic about
our solutions as we bring those to the

611
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,180
table

612
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,500
now that we're not be underdogs and
these issues are in the limelight

613
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,460
they will be appreciated even more it
makes us better security people

614
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,690
to understand the privacy aspects of the
things that we're doing

615
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,530
and boiling it down also to kinda
bite-sized pieces

616
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,930
this is something we Excel as a
community

617
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,120
and its evidence by how week will go
after a single

618
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,310
or ability and fill an entire room of
people

619
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,730
to talk about the details that one
former ability and how we got there

620
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,190
we're not looking at vulnerability
overall in the marketplace when we do

621
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,000
that

622
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,550
we're looking at a single-issue that we
can actually accomplish intake

623
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,320
take on had a technical level

624
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,859
um hiring two write resumes welcome

625
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,470
up thank you appreciate your time I
because have

626
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,740
any questions for me

627
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:42,740
yes yeah

628
00:36:58,809 --> 00:36:59,999
so good

629
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:03,660
tell me what were you thinking jim the
question ever people was I'm it seems

630
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,569
that the solutions that we actually need

631
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:10,329
to enable privacy a lot of times or
anything but pragmatic and yes we did

632
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:13,490
to I answer that I'm I i disagree.

633
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,160
I i think that when you when you're
looking at these

634
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,240
issues if it seems super not practical

635
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,828
you're looking at too much of the
problem once that's what I mean when I

636
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:26,519
say take on bite size pieces

637
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:30,288
boiled down to what the actual root
cause

638
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,960
is or the root causes are the things
you're looking at and take one on

639
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,900
now and then take another on and take
another on this is a multi-year process

640
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,349
I've been at this for two and a half
years in being I can say

641
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:48,099
proudly I've gone through I think three
or four

642
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,329
major technical architecture additions

643
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:56,220
that were implemented that I now feel
pretty okay about some parts

644
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,169
the things that we're doing or where you
know before maybe it wasn't so okay with

645
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,420
it

646
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,779
it's a multi-year process and we have to
be patient

647
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:07,180
alright thumbs up

648
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:14,180
answered other question yes

649
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,919
okay so the question is I as you go
online there's some

650
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,630
assess the to identify yourself all the
privacy community would say

651
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,029
that I they would prefer for everyone to
remain completely anonymous

652
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:05,569
but then balance that with we have
children masquerading as adults and very

653
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:08,109
adult sites very adult sorts of things

654
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:11,970
gee I have no idea where you could
possibly to be talking about porn

655
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:16,129
I and how as parents

656
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,289
can we reconcile that an hour's a
society can we

657
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:23,670
we reconcile those two points excellent
question

658
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,880
and I think we're actually looking at
two or three

659
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,000
different issues with that right why the
first issue that we're looking at his

660
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,670
identity

661
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,260
identity is central to solving the
privacy

662
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,460
an actual %ah to the security problems
around data

663
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,019
with out positive identity assertion

664
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:45,189
it is very very difficult to do that so
this is like

665
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,200
%uh there was a cookie law that was
passed in

666
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,980
I or directive in the EU and England was
the first country deposit and the

667
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
Netherlands also

668
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,690
out for the first countries to try and
force it and they went great this law

669
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:03,809
that said um you must ask before you can
store cookies on the Internet

670
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:09,000
okay ridiculous on 2.1 how are you going
to store the answer to that

671
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,930
in a cookie to for you to break state

672
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,269
on the Internet by disallowing all
cookies to happen right

673
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:19,368
so iight even I

674
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:23,650
this is very similar in that in order to
achieve the privacy that we're looking

675
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,680
for there has to be some level

676
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,118
assertion a positive identification now

677
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,730
that assertion can be different
depending on the context

678
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,119
that you're looking at this is going
much more into the identity than that

679
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,130
you know specific a privacy or security
aspect

680
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,210
a bit out but there's a different level
love identity that you need

681
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:49,299
to log into your hotmail account then

682
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:55,500
to go browse around the web site
Microsoft needs to understand that

683
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,450
you're actually

684
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:00,669
the individual or and individual has the
right credentials

685
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,430
to get into the Hotmail account whereas
going to

686
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:09,569
being as an example you can come
completely anonymous if you so desire

687
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:13,160
or you can give varying levels upon her
authentication depending on the level of

688
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,299
service that you walk

689
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:19,049
so that's one part his identity the
second part is controls

690
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:22,700
so once we have these possible identity
assertions

691
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,069
the controls are simply don't exist to
be able to

692
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:30,849
like as a parent I this is kinda how I
came to this whole problem

693
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:35,509
understand what my children are doing
protect them from

694
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:40,029
bad things they don't understand from
evil people

695
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:43,579
who want to do things that are
reprehensible and

696
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:47,490
illegal and you know they obviously
haven't seen me

697
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,450
they obviously don't know my wife or
know they wouldn't desire to do these

698
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:51,879
things

699
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,920
our children to the probably value their
own lives more than that

700
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,700
but I that those those controls to exist
and this is actually exactly what I'm

701
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,730
what I'm looking for I'm not telling you
all here

702
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:08,150
is the solution I'm saying we have
solutions in this room

703
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,309
we need to be thinking about how we
address these problems

704
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:18,309
I'm think you'll appreciate the question
and other questions yes

705
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,240
thoughts on what

706
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:30,240
prism so I will give you first the
official Microsoft line

707
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,240
which is we comply with all legal orders

708
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,750
now let me tell you what that means it
means we

709
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,630
only comply with legal force in big

710
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,960
as an example I get requests from

711
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,960
0 members have government let's say a
senator's wife

712
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,750
when had a bender one weekend gotten a
car accident with

713
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,190
a boy toy in the car happens

714
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,210
they come to me the same remove this
data

715
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,360
like no I so that's one side

716
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,360
on the other side we get someone in an
official capacity

717
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,870
coming to me saying I'm doing an
investigation give me data about

718
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,950
axe so in the first instance

719
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:28,020
I'd say show me a legal order show me a
core

720
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,280
order saying I have to remove the data
and the second instance idesh

721
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,650
I'd say show me the subpoena show me a
subpoena that gives you access to this

722
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,130
data

723
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,410
so either to remove or to distribute

724
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,750
data I require legal

725
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,940
orders I will say on a

726
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:52,440
non super official although I understand
I represent Microsoft because I work for

727
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:52,800
them

728
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,670
I before I worked at Mikes after work

729
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,630
Bell Labs Lucent I was via and I'm
actually avoid engineer

730
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,810
by trade I understand what it means to
process

731
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,970
Voice if

732
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:13,120
the NSA work actually capturing all
these phone calls recording and

733
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,120
processing

734
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,950
them I think the processing that went on
their

735
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,319
would be so enormous that arm

736
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,710
the heat coming off the processors would
be view a ball from space

737
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:29,470
and I and that's not an exaggeration

738
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:34,160
it would actually change ecologies with
the amount of heat was being produced by

739
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,250
these processors

740
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:39,240
right it its technically rather
infeasible

741
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,270
some the links that are said to be going
to but on the other hand

742
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:47,660
if the NSA is not getting copies evolve
the International

743
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,660
phone calls that go on from the United
States

744
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,390
or to the United States what the hell
are we paying them for

745
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:01,250
isn't that their job

746
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,880
was up their country their global
warming

747
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,920
global warning a and I can tell you
actually running a data center's a very

748
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,230
expensive operation

749
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,599
I'm it takes a lot of energy so we have
that you know approaching exit by today

750
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:15,089
to

751
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:19,410
and we've got hundreds of thousands of
servers just working on being

752
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,560
I'll understanding the amount of heat
that were actually dealing with their

753
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,690
the amount of power that were actually
dealing with

754
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,730
to do the things that are being asserted
that the NSA is doing

755
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,040
I would have to be much much much much
much larger by like

756
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,369
an order back into or to Anya I think it
would be

757
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,130
it would be pretty noticeable no they're
they're doing some things

758
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,900
but legal order thats from Microsoft
from Google

759
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,349
from everybody that's what you're
hearing we require legal order

760
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,339
in Swat Obama saying is what the
senators are saying they're saying these

761
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:51,990
are legal

762
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:57,520
programs other questions

763
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,520
yes way back

764
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,190
yep

765
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,320
I so very good question the question is

766
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,599
up how are we talking about customers
what about inside a corporation how do

767
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:27,280
we keep

768
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,099
I you know employees a from getting
access resource be

769
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:34,920
the Joker love was you're clearly the
NSA is a very good at that

770
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,710
well played I hear them I have an
opening here in a way

771
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:43,430
right %uh and

772
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,140
that's actually a very very good
questions I'll have another conversation

773
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,430
yesterday somebody

774
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,580
pas oppose this is a question I to me in
a different kind of way and I said

775
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,859
it would seem to me that work at the
living in the cloud

776
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:58,759
this example uses where I live in spend
my time is building a cloud

777
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,000
that as a consumer in the cloud I'm
going to by default

778
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,800
get for a level of security the same
level as the person who requires the

779
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,750
maximum level of security that your
customer

780
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,420
and that's true so we have lots of
controls

781
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,480
I can tell you in place I in being we go
out we copy the Internet right we're not

782
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,910
dealing with a ton of intellectual
property there that's not already public

783
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:23,450
domain

784
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:28,210
office 365 on the other hand holds the
intellectual property have lots of other

785
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,140
companies and there's lots of controls
in place to keep

786
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,720
employees a from seeing things about
company be here for keeping company be

787
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,118
from seeing things about all that's a
DOD companies see

788
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,470
right that there's a lot of controls in
place and it is one of the areas that we

789
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,259
focus on

790
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,220
I spent almost as much time in my
privacy

791
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,618
role in being keeping other internal
partners

792
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:55,119
out of the data as I do making sure that
we build things the right way

793
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,240
and we only allow those axis ease if we
have that consent

794
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,598
and we have that notice and we have the

795
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:06,240
are more the legal right inability to
share the data in those ways

796
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,118
and there's a lot of ways that we can as
low as that we do but there's other ways

797
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:10,589
that

798
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:14,279
we just go other questions

799
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,030
alright thank you very much and I
appreciate

800
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,410
your time
