18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,589
help me welcome deviant %ah

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,420
thanks I'll alright yeah I might up here

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,920
so yes I'm in pseudo professional mode

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,570
which means I'm drinking from an opaque
up and there's deniability and less than

22
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,380
10 that's a profanity per hour

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,460
so a lot of people

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,740
look at the website the schedule and
they said well that's not right

25
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,240
deviance up there talking about Android
devices this is clue who stalk

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,380
look for the guy talking about locks he
shouldn't be he was like an Android

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,380
devil figure out who type something
wrong

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,390
%uh no that is not the case L

29
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,509
I do have a life outside of locks and
guns

30
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,420
and a lot of a lot of times I get to do
a little work on the side that turns

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,409
into something fun

32
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,479
I'm not going to be up here drop in
Meadow day

33
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,000
or anything like that that really just
kinda shatters the earth and lose your

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,590
world

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,920
but hopefully I'll show you some really
cool things

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,799
that'll be very accessible and the fact
that I'm not an Android super ninja

37
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,049
means that my level is may be close to
your level if you're just a casual

38
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,070
Android user or power Tweaker

39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,699
you like it a lot out your phone he
didn't know you could and I hope you

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,250
enjoy it

41
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,520
so we're gonna start if you're brave
enough

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,530
will also enhance maybe

43
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,980
depends if you think it's a good idea
but ultimately i'm curious

44
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,090
how many %uh view do having a work only
laptop

45
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,670
right you have a laptop you do working
things with

46
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,940
so you probably have corporate email
running on that

47
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,800
there's a really good chance you also
have your own personal email running on

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,280
that

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,640
obviously you're browsing the web you're
doing a lot of things on the internet

50
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,599
maybe even some voice and chat and text
and things

51
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,190
well because if this there's a chance

52
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,459
maybe a little more hands that you might
in crypt your laptop

53
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,209
anyone alright we got some whole
descriptor going on very good I'm glad

54
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:44,959
to hear it

55
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,879
now how many telephone that should be
most your heads yet

56
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,760
but your phones nowadays I mean when you
think about it people more and more they

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,530
would ask me

58
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,069
you note so now you have a really nice
phone you take your laptop anywhere I

59
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,609
really don't listen presenting

60
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,540
our phones do every single one of these
things and more

61
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,099
write your phone isn't just a business
portal it's like you taking all your

62
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,790
family vacation photos

63
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,329
you're taking your non family vacation
photos there's a lot of the I don't know

64
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,870
what you do when you're outta town with
an expense budget but

65
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,489
there's a lot of things that wind up on
your phone I got half the room laughing

66
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,420
been up the whole room laugh and so
that's why

67
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,319
I you don't understand my talks involve
a lot of laughter and joking and drink

68
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:27,859
and so

69
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,349
Success Kid will let you know when we
should all be left in our heads of stuff

70
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,119
on my slights

71
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,340
so funny drunk passed out people not to
mention all of your important business

72
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,200
contacts and personal details

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
how many view actually encrypt your
phone alright

74
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,790
little hats like that some have hands-on
other hands why is this why is this that

75
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,939
we understand fundamentally that your
laptop is something to be guarded your

76
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,650
lap 20 man I would never like

77
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,019
let my body use my laptop and walk away
from just let him sit there

78
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,459
but our phones are essentially wide open
when in the end there representing

79
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,560
access pathway to the same exact
critical data

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,030
that our laptops to well

81
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,480
how often do we talk about best
practices mobile devices

82
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,798
not often enough my opinion let's go
over that really fast because

83
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,820
maybe it's just something you haven't
heard people really ran through the way

84
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,580
we talk about

85
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,900
regular computing devices letting
someone just borrow your phone or casual

86
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,580
even handle it

87
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,359
that used to be kinda thing you could do
you know you're an airport to strangers

88
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,380
looks all that I'm not from this country
and have a sim card tonight

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,400
call somebody yeah whatever here's my
phone

90
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,710
I mean we're nice people you want to do
that now a days especially if you know

91
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,320
someone or maybe if you do know your
friends were all very tech heads

92
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,830
oh you got the new whatever and nine can
I see that will check this out man

93
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,270
you're flipping through it

94
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,520
I don't think that's a really good idea
and there's nothing wrong

95
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,630
with telling someone know you know get
to get your own phone

96
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,419
like its think to me it's equivalent of
someone saying

97
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,669
damn I really gotta send that email I
why wish I had my laptop can you are

98
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,560
using that can you spin your laptop
around for me and let me I just

99
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,240
just type way for a while unless I'm
like sleeping with you

100
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,039
I'm pretty not pretty much nothing to be
my laptop for that purpose

101
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,110
a same thing with my phone my phone is
at least your laptop you can like

102
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,130
log out of session you can turn
TrueCrypt of

103
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,400
you can given kinda bare metal a phone
if it's unlocked

104
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,799
it's pretty much all open don't just let
people handle your phone

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,400
don't plug your phone into stuff you
don't know ok

106
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,599
we were talking about this at dinner the
other night there are a lot of

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,979
interesting little devices out there now
little power devices cause if you ever

108
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,240
check out as is talk about drive-by
downloads

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,259
check out all the different things that
can happen with rogue devices being

110
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,259
plugged into your phone

111
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:56,490
and not just here I'm this random person
giving you think black box plug it in

112
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,400
i'm talking about modern consumer gear
the technology for making attack device

113
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,948
is smaller and smaller is out there

114
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,340
look at the black hat talk this coming
up this summer about the new device the

115
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,008
Mactan

116
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,690
it's based off the BeagleBoard it's
basically weapon Ising a tiny attack

117
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,520
module

118
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,240
that you could disguise inside out let's
say a charger pack

119
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,720
how many people using a charger pack
would really look at their phone like I

120
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,240
hang on lemme

121
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,259
let me watch this battery percentage I'm
now it's not really going up fast

122
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,009
what's up here this isn't enough really
empowers as long as the phone lights up

123
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,889
the LED's as yeah I'm charging

124
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,449
most people wouldn't question it on all
the sudden they come back later like

125
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,500
other things a piece a junk damn free
giveaway at a security conference

126
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I'd love to see that somebody set up a
table that's like mobile power from us

127
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
to you make up a fake company

128
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,729
and just see how many people you can pop
on their phone right

129
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,000
another good practice how many people
are actually using

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,319
encrypt email properly on their phone
maybe a couple hands

131
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,500
it sucks getting getting pgp to set up
correctly but a PG one it's working in a

132
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,949
great great with canine

133
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,130
it's not as hard as you might think it
is how many people set up VPN

134
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,719
to Tyler alright I get a lot of the same
hands on this there's a few people like

135
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,430
I know you're talking about

136
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,720
yeah there's a lot you could be doing it
should be doing

137
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,169
a lot of people get distracted away from
it because they think it's complicated

138
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,049
to use

139
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,069
like what skill involved really long
pass phrases and who's got time for that

140
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,780
does anybody know what this icon is what
tool this is KeePass

141
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,638
how many people use KeePass how many
people knew their ski pass for Android

142
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,819
makes the whole lot easier yes you have
to type your one long pass phrase in but

143
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,800
once you have

144
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,030
you can quickly copy and then securely
dump out of memory

145
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,068
your passwords its really makes my life
a lot easier

146
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,289
how many please tell me how many people
are not

147
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,568
just swipe to unlock you actually have a
a lock pattern or pan

148
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,599
are I love you too who do how many hands
can stay up when I ask you how many are

149
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,389
fully encrypting your phone

150
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,800
we asked earlier alright it's just about
as easy to do

151
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,810
they're actually integrated very tightly
and write in ways you might cut

152
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,020
understand

153
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,460
but think about that stuff think about
all of this as we flip through

154
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,349
a real brief primer on how the Android
file system works how these devices are

155
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:19,490
functioning

156
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,110
and what is and isn't getting protected

157
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,960
when you try to do things that you want
to be more secure

158
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,818
in a nutshell and again I'm not an
android dev so anyone who is gonna be

159
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,229
cringing like he's simplifying that will

160
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,260
most if you aren't android-developers so
this in a nutshell

161
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,099
is the Android file system it is most of
you I hope no its a unix-based files it

162
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,669
selects filesystem

163
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,870
there are certain partitions where data
gets capped some of which you touch

164
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,110
on a daily basis as a user most of which
you don't

165
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,430
to simplify things were not going to
talk about everything on the phone the

166
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,839
cache partition

167
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,600
the miscellaneous partition was not even
every device has we're going nor a few

168
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,130
of those

169
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,720
but just understanding this right here
the boot partition

170
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,860
the recovery which will get to the
system partition the data partition

171
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,610
and some storage many have you i assume

172
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,640
do understand that a lot of this is
virtualized for instance a storage

173
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,510
partition like

174
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,250
SD card it's not like that snotty nance
ship that that's a mounted

175
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,310
device if you've ever dealt with when X
before your mounting external devices

176
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,399
but as you look at the phone you're just
seeing that as

177
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,750
okay storage your SD card there's a lot
of virtualization that you might not

178
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,730
understand

179
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,990
and it's been changing with the new
Android API's so

180
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,920
how many people have to storage or two
memory partitions they have it's amazing

181
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,050
internal memory

182
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,880
external memory right well if you have
for instance an s3

183
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,000
you know that you don't have to SD cards

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,080
so where is the other one like an ant
chip somewhere on the firm know it's

185
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,440
the other one is a virtualized partition
it's part of your data partition

186
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,910
but it's it internal memory that's out
there's a lot of virtualization going on

187
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,459
keep that in mind for example and the
people have a nexus to you

188
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,619
Nexus tablet yeah I mean people have
tablets or other devices

189
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,700
the don't have SD cards at all

190
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,079
then you have just internal memory and
again it's not like there's an SD card

191
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,719
inside at the you can't pull out it's
not it's just part love your data

192
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,700
partition

193
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,269
this comes into play we talk about
crypto in things

194
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,930
so houses all fit together how does the
device actually run

195
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,010
when you fire up your phone

196
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,720
the boot partition is the actual index
card

197
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,950
that's what fires up underneath the OS
obviously you're not seeing it

198
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,820
you guys are on your near enough hungry
people you know what the colonel is

199
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,839
right

200
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,320
gone after the colonel colonel though
this is a command processor

201
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,550
while a joke fell flat alright yup

202
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,979
I you gotta get the hackers references
or else what do you do in a calm like

203
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,640
this come on

204
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,449
so your body a Linux kernel of course
you're not seeing it that's in the

205
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,450
background

206
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,970
but you will start to see the phone do
something once the system partition

207
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,950
gets involved that is the actual stock
environment

208
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,230
that comes with the phone that's your
basic you know

209
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,329
boot animation stock aP's stock Android

210
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,529
system once it boots up fully

211
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,480
and you're in a user environment that is
the data partition

212
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,209
and thats all you're hitting for most
people you understand that like the data

213
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,420
partition is where your settings live

214
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,790
your Google account things like that but
even if you download aP's

215
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,329
this that that's all going in data thats
everything in

216
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:44,579
data that is what you touch and you
shouldn't be touching anything else

217
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,959
most to the TOC this is it felt this is
basically

218
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,540
all that happens with the exception of
recovery which will get to

219
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,069
but understand those things are all
separate and they have their own

220
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,389
separate purpose

221
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:00,910
when people talk about modding their
phones are hacking their phones are

222
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,560
tweaking their phones are putting a new

223
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,489
a new rom on their phone which I always
use the thing was a dumb name unlike

224
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,000
what a fuckin ROM

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,040
the only time I had rom's is when I had
a Nintendo emulator and I was

226
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,199
downloading games like a ROM is a
read-only I didn't

227
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,540
turns out it's actually not a dumb name

228
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,060
there's one other element to the phone
we talk about hacking in modding we

229
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,079
should know about

230
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,800
that is the bootloader the bootloader
which runs underneath

231
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,769
everything else the first thing the
fires up the bootloader can be locked

232
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:34,200
or unlocked some manufacturers most lock
their rulers nowadays

233
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,910
a locked bootloader simply means that
the phone will only run

234
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,100
signed code it will only run

235
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,670
a colonel it's expecting the stock OS is
expecting

236
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,639
now you can unlock the bootloader and
people do that because they say my

237
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,380
original phone it boots up okay it's my
stock environment

238
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,589
at its kinda really limiting and I want
something better or

239
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,579
first thing people do usually is unlock
the bootloader

240
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,359
which doesn't change the rest the phone
the phone will still boot normally

241
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,959
il bu the signed CoA but also boo
unsigned code

242
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,649
self and unlocked bootloaders on the
phone you can't push out something new

243
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,410
the sale right now I got some custom
Android craziness and check out my new

244
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,670
badassery in

245
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,290
it's gonna be awesome a new user
environment on this trip down to do

246
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,779
crazy things

247
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,939
that's how people get custom rom's and
custom Android environments they're

248
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,389
replacing

249
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,360
their stock environment exist still
sensible so far

250
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,079
a lot how many people were done this
modify alright so we got heads we got

251
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,279
I've got people in the room very good

252
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,410
the ROM the quote-unquote system
partition as I said it's not a really

253
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:41,980
dumb

254
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,839
name to call a ROM because whatever's in
there

255
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,480
generally doesn't get touched that and
boot

256
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,779
you as a user never modify those

257
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:58,630
those components you don't write any
data to it

258
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,769
should be aware there is a certain
compatibility that has to happen

259
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:06,769
between the kernel you're running and
the system ROM on the phone

260
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,399
so for example let's say you have a
stock phone that's slightly older so

261
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,100
it's running

262
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,120
Android 4.0 if you're the type of person
who says I'm gonna

263
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,339
wipe out my system I gotta put a new rom
on the phone

264
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,740
so excited to mod nine was also Android
4.0

265
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,760
the phone is probably not gonna mind but
if you get really into like power

266
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,740
tweaking the star

267
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,350
I want the latest and greatest screws I
wanna get the latest jelly bean they've

268
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,940
got CyanogenMod 10

269
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,949
which is now not the latest because
others 4.2

270
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:39,389
and if you're not running 4.2 you don't
realize how much they patch sense 4.1

271
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:42,570
but this might not boot the phone might
be like a

272
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,190
well why is the ROM is expecting a new
or Linux kernel

273
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,180
and you actually have to push out
basically knew what some people call a

274
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,420
new boo image

275
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,719
same thing you're pushing out a new
kernel is going to hell boy who makes a

276
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,139
lot of custom kernels if you ever get
stock

277
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:00,430
Google Hellboy but in general

278
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,589
that's what's happening on the phone
books what about

279
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,449
quote-unquote the term factory reset is
another thing you hear bandied about

280
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,589
a lock when people are modding hacking
their phones

281
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:14,199
a factory reset doesn't affect

282
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,760
the system ROM it's not like how many
people ever had

283
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,939
like a a relative who had a laptop they
screwed up

284
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,899
and you like ol man I really do not want
to wipe this whole thing and we're

285
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,790
but always look if you booed up with
this recovery disk

286
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,420
you can you know gets the system part of
the hidden partition I just wipe out the

287
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,769
C Drive and push that the whole stock
configuration back

288
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,839
that's not what we're talking about an
Android a factory reset you're not doing

289
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,180
anything to system

290
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,410
a factory reset simply says alright the
user has a bunch of stuff

291
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,550
in data that they've been doing to their
phone they probably also a buncha stuff

292
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,189
on there

293
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,740
external memory a fast one factory reset

294
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,120
wipes data so the phone boots up the
very next time as if to say welcome to

295
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,310
Android I see you've never used me

296
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,029
would you like to set up a Google
account now or do you have an existing

297
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:05,800
one

298
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,109
that's all factory reset its

299
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,070
a course it gets a little interesting if
you're in this kinda situation

300
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,880
where the memory the the SD card is
really not an SD card if it's part of

301
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,240
your data partition

302
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,779
there's a chance you're blowin that out
ready to be confused

303
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,800
you know always wipe out the SD card
because some factory resets are

304
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,109
different than others

305
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,300
and we'll talk about that a bit with
custom recoveries

306
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,389
so what is a recovery what is this whole
Recovery Environment

307
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,500
you seen the little purple partition and
are diagrams here

308
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,690
the Recovery Environment how many people
that were booted to recovery

309
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,259
we like hold volume down and press the
button and

310
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,350
recovery is a separate /boot environment

311
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,829
that gives you a small sweet up tools if
you get into recovery

312
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:54,250
you have a lead usually a stock recovery
is very limited it'll do things like

313
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,600
factory reset

314
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,300
it's the kinda stuff that up an Android
service center will do our phone South

315
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,620
mobile phone center will too well you
screw this up we don't know how

316
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,959
factory reset the light about data they
can apply some patches and updates very

317
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,100
minimally you can wipe the cache

318
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,069
but that is the recovery environment
it's an environment in which

319
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,629
you can do things to the rest to the
phone in a very limited way

320
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,730
without actually booting into Android

321
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,069
now some people well the race

322
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,329
and replace their Recovery Environment
something custom

323
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,600
how many people ever put a custom
recovery on the phone all right now even

324
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,649
fewer hands this time at

325
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,750
custom recoveries are amazing clockwork
lot modest easily won the most popular

326
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,120
ones

327
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,709
it is the most popular one out there I
actually stop using clockwork I now use

328
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,020
one call team when

329
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,440
the team when recovery project the
twerps at is in my pennies

330
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,580
even nicer it's a little less buggy it's
a little more advanced in some ways

331
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,570
but all these custom recoveries can do
amazing things

332
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,610
now we we talk about replacing the
system ROM

333
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,049
the actual I want a new and rate
environment my phone this is usually how

334
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,129
it's happening

335
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,480
people are running their fault like I'm
in my regular Android session

336
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,990
they will download their entire new
system as a zip

337
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,850
and that if you get into recovery that's
where you can wipe your system partition

338
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,840
which now the phone won't boot see
better have downloaded what you needed

339
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,159
there's always ways around

340
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,419
bricked phones but the ideas you extract
the zip file

341
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,690
right out on top of what you had before
that's when people are replacing the

342
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,260
quote-unquote

343
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,870
ROM arse Android system on their phone
that's what's happening

344
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,360
that's why people love custom recoveries

345
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,289
say boo backup okay herre there's my new
Android woohoo yay

346
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,299
a word of advice sometimes old user data

347
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:47,639
from previous versions of Android to
make this process not work

348
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,020
that's why if you ever try I'm gonna
download that's i an urgent thing they

349
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,970
talked about

350
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,940
and the thread will install instructions
always says do a factory reset first

351
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,230
it's because as the system is booting
into then sees a bunch of absence

352
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,990
settings

353
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,320
that pertain to an older version of
Android the phone all sometimes get

354
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,309
goofy it's like if you had a ghost image
of your machine and all the sudden he

355
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:09,120
said alright

356
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,809
I backed up all my app so back to my
program data and then I installed a new

357
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,270
version of windows and then just

358
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,879
dump the Program Files directory back on
it that's not a day to Magic Kingdom

359
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,370
custom Android recoveries can do really
powerful things out

360
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,280
this is I'm gonna start I'm selling your
heart on modding your phones by the way

361
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,410
this is me saying if you don't have an
Android phone you should get one

362
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,510
if if only to play with and if you do
have an Android phone is a chance you

363
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,679
want to be brave enough to try to model

364
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,240
how does one replace the custom recovery
by the way couple waz

365
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,070
if your phone has the right permissions
or can exploit itself

366
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,559
is that's that's what we're worried
about a lot of these things an Android

367
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,190
people are sexually exploiting their own
device to break away from the factory

368
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,660
setting security

369
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,549
but some people while there in their
actual Android OS session

370
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:01,820
can flash in Newark they can flash the
actual recovery partition

371
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,309
or they can exploit flasher or yet new
data on to recovery

372
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,158
more often than not though people are
doing it not in the Android session

373
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,059
you download the recovery image you want
you get your phone into something called

374
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,539
fast boot mode

375
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,429
if your phone supports fast food it's
great it's essentially it's

376
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,169
just a direct command line you can drop
to on your on your laptop if you're

377
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:23,070
attached to it

378
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,049
you can push the files out you can
overwrite things my phone because I have

379
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:27,970
an s3

380
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,299
a lot of the Samsung product support
what is called download mode

381
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:36,220
same idea you're you're just using
engineering software at this point

382
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,669
to push binaries out onto the boot
partition or the recovery partition

383
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:44,780
that's that the processor if you can
replace a recovery image

384
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,100
and you get it running you're home free
getting your custom recovery up lets you

385
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,559
do

386
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,000
all this coolness perhaps the coolest
thing

387
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,510
how many people remember cemented ghost

388
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,908
and people used it on jobs and a major
life way for getting easier

389
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:05,230
when the sales guy comes in from six
months on the road looks at the laptop

390
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,760
you like all got I could throw this in a
fire

391
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,890
or I could just go there you go

392
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,320
sorry for its gone you can

393
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,960
basically do this with Android phones
and a custom recovery

394
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,990
this is far with the once I saw this I
was like Don

395
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,080
sold never turning back never using
another type of phone

396
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,720
if you get into a custom recovery
environment and say I wanna run a backup

397
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,150
it will literally scan and pack as tar
image

398
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,750
all love your partitions am them them

399
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:44,039
them even if you have cash in extended
and whatever other partitions you want

400
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,549
it'll package it all up and archive that

401
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:51,740
to side memory either the SD card or
internal memory

402
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,820
if you have backup features like this
your life

403
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,350
at least my kinda life gets a lot better

404
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,168
because you with an are at liberty to do
a lot of really wild shit to your phone

405
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:03,830
and you don't care as much

406
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,129
this is like its I wish I wish it's one
of those things this is a cool demo

407
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,299
Bruce Potter once said really awesome
technics bad demos like

408
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,100
ever watch encryption demo like it's a
gripping right now

409
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,020
it's done like it's you get demo this
but thats it lets it's happening right

410
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,918
there before your eyes like

411
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,679
this is a backup process running a
custom recovery environment

412
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,940
so if you're the type of person who
stops all over your phone

413
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,230
I got the latest this and check this out
a new absent old am I screwed that one

414
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,890
up

415
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,830
or if you have a rooted phone East are
stopping all over the system partition

416
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,850
the Arts

417
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,899
I don't like that keyboard our place ol
shit what I delete that

418
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,510
hell you can corrupt your boot kernel
you can just screw that holds the whole

419
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,429
thing

420
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:53,210
as long as you can get into recovery
does not matter

421
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,000
hell yeah I like I've done this on the
phone with you

422
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,090
I was on the phone later Merlin I was
like what why am i

423
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,399
hang out this is but this gimme a minute
I gotta call you back

424
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,210
I'm gonna reply I don't know what I did
I put not pool five minutes later I

425
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,280
pushed the old backup from a week ago

426
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,320
phones back up fine ok like I gotta
remember what the hell I downloaded and

427
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,299
not do that again

428
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:21,360
one other feature a phone's besides
talking to people

429
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,289
what is the most common way that people
like to use their phone

430
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:29,360
it take pictures they won't have a
camera phone

431
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,889
just evidence of the awesome thinking
that goes into these

432
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,049
custom recovery environments and the
reason I gotta love team when

433
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:40,000
look at this process over a store that's
running says okay so here we've got a

434
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,120
backup file were checking the md5

435
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,610
system partition format it done restored
data partition

436
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,879
wiping without wiping data immediate
actually saves your photos and other

437
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,919
things

438
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,720
it doesn't knock them out now maybe
there's gonna be an exploit one day

439
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,950
that's gonna try to hide

440
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,669
in like your DCIM folder I don't know
maybe given out ideas

441
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:02,890
but I love that I think that's freakin
brilliant it's really really good

442
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,429
thinking it just works

443
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:08,870
well you can imagine this imagine
keeping your backup of device

444
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:14,059
you could be in another country set your
phone on fire and throw in a toilet

445
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:18,570
yeah like us basically I one of toilet
was involved the flame

446
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,168
kinda was walk into a store if you're
the kind of person who has I don't know

447
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:26,000
the most popular phone on the market
right now

448
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,190
five minutes later or if your little bit
slow you know I've never tried this

449
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,770
before

450
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:34,450
literally 10-15 minutes later your phone
is exactly back up the way it was

451
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,880
all over again just like that that is a

452
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,289
awesome feature in my opinion to having
customize phone stuff

453
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:46,408
let's talk about some said things now
I'm time sell you on the the awesomeness

454
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:53,309
of stuff you can do with Android there
are few exploits need to worry about

455
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:59,158
physical access especially with
debugging or developer tools turned on

456
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,340
is a direct factor for exploiting attack
again this all goes back to causes talk

457
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,789
the drive-by downloads talk it doesn't
matter if the phone is locked it doesn't

458
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,000
matter if you're running I'm gonna

459
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,090
boot into recovery any of this

460
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,970
someone can usually get to the Android
debug bridge and stomp all over the

461
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,330
phone

462
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,059
and all the custom recovery czar like
this fortunately

463
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,740
if the phone is up and running as an
Android environment you can drop a

464
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,779
little app on their

465
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:29,100
called ATV secure which by the way you
don't need in the very latest

466
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,520
API the Android 4.2 they just fix this
and system

467
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,289
but if you don't have the latest and
greatest which virtually no phone does

468
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:37,049
right now

469
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,289
ATV secure if the screen is unlocked you
can use the Android debug bridge if the

470
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,360
screen is locked

471
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,689
it's just of so the moment you just
leave your phone laying on a cafe table

472
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,970
no one can get in there no one can do
anything your your

473
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,590
completely blocking this exploit vector

474
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,330
areas yes cheer for Success Kid alright

475
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,600
alright let's talk about cropped up

476
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,469
because that's in the news nowadays as
far as mobile devices are concerned

477
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,580
from the Android system

478
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,658
if you're doing any kind a crypto we
goodness

479
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:16,870
only a fax for data

480
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,850
it's not like a blackberry many your
business focused on blackberries before

481
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,299
they went

482
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,270
you know completely belly-up data

483
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,730
not system not boot not SD card either
which is kinda sucks

484
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,299
date is what gets encrypt it now you
might think that's kinda bad but

485
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,279
remember

486
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,789
if you're using your phone like 99
percent every Android user

487
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:40,240
you don't touch anything but data on a
day-to-day basis

488
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,260
that's where everything is so encrypting
that make sense

489
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,039
and if you happen to have a phone that
supports quote internal memory

490
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,789
that's also getting cryptid so there's a
plus on that one

491
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:55,870
how does it work in practice if you've
never seen a phone its straightforward a

492
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,928
simple phone boots up

493
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:01,700
starts booting the Andrew environment
the moment season encrypt it partitions

494
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,880
as hell wat

495
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,620
I need I need to the crib your storage
here you punch in your key

496
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,100
it likes it booting continues normally
and then

497
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,129
it takes you to your regular environment
and they are it's a really really nice

498
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,179
setup that works really well

499
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:21,159
it's fine for anybody who's running
custom ROM's summer stock rom is also

500
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,080
support it

501
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,689
its if you're not too are using Android
encryption maybe you have an older

502
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,270
version of Android does it was a little
bit clunky and didn't

503
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,929
would enable was a but newest versions
and richly bean 4.1 4.2

504
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:37,460
it works really smoothly in my
experience also the customer coverings

505
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,020
you doing backups in this and that they
all hand on corruption

506
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,649
you boot into like this is booting into
team win and it says oh wait a minute

507
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:48,620
encrypt a device found you just key in a
passphrase their egos okay

508
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,789
new lock device virtually created
updating partitions

509
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:56,460
them they can restore it can backup can
do everything you want

510
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,590
please remember though speaking of team
win and other recoveries that your

511
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,370
backups

512
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,689
if you're doing these and right back up
there in the clear

513
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,419
it's not like the Recovery Environment
says who encrypt it I should encryptor

514
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,559
this backup

515
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,220
know it's just making a tarball love
your other files

516
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,029
so if you're saving your backups please
save them to internal memory

517
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:20,169
so that there in an encrypted state or
if you're backing up of your phone

518
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:24,110
which I highly recommend you do copy
your backups to a laptop or some

519
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:31,059
external storage please make sure that
is on an encrypted volume as well

520
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:34,940
let's talk about screen locks because
we're talking about different ways to

521
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,210
prevent people from just

522
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,700
picking up your phone and doing things
to it

523
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,779
if you haven't seen causes talk about
the screen lock

524
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,990
I know the Android pattern is like sexy

525
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,760
the first time you get an Android
devices the like wow this is also is so

526
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,908
fun I can unlock my phone would like
finger painting

527
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:56,260
and then after a few days you turn off
those green circle schedule like this is

528
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,549
really bad people kinda noticed this

529
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:02,529
I got word for you even if you turned
off the green circles trails

530
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:05,740
the screen lock by pattern is not very
secure

531
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,679
I'm not going to get into the you can
watch causes all talk on the Derby Conn

532
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:09,289
feed

533
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,770
he talks all about how first of all
there are a lot of permutations on a3 by

534
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,029
3

535
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:17,100
and it's all stored as a hash and you
can't dump the hash you can break the

536
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,330
hash you can do a lot of things to it

537
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,168
that is not that secure there's also in
my opinion

538
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:26,029
and many of you may already know this
you maybe even done this to someone at

539
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:29,010
the office like oh stanley left his
phone

540
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,950
how many people I don't know if our
lighting is going to be on this but here

541
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,580
we have two phones

542
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,678
I put my phone on a desk I palladium
rose phone on a desk

543
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,419
and I set them up exactly the same way
with one exception

544
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,580
I set one of them with screen lock and
one of them with Penn lock

545
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,149
now darn where we're really a can we
bump in our

546
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,918
rightness or anything we're gonna we're
not gonna see anything at all on the

547
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,450
screen like this

548
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,529
can we bump the brightness of the
projector if we can't you know in the

549
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,890
second

550
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,950
or we could drop these lights up here
for a second that'll work too

551
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,940
whatever's easier

552
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,210
this is like parlor games toughen up
some slowing down the hall talk just for

553
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,190
that

554
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:19,190
you have to drink more

555
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,980
let's see I think the brightness up top
might have done it for you for that but

556
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,380
see

557
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,790
on our going somewhere okay

558
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,680
thank you thank you so now thank you sir
no he did that can anyone guess for me

559
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,510
which one has pattern in a vault

560
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,840
yeah I'm gonna say it's the one on the
right

561
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,750
but here's the thing about that this was
not even the three by three this was an

562
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,510
insane like five by five batter

563
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,900
which you can do it different versions
of Android a different custom ROM's

564
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,640
its but literally it is the yellow brick
road dorothy is hopscotch in her way

565
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,650
right to the wizard on that one and I
just want to have some fun with this so

566
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,000
i sat there is that alright let me a
lot. the phones

567
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,830
let me browse around let me do some
things let me like

568
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,300
go into maps and scroll all over there
we are with you

569
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,419
lock the phone again and even with a lot
of lighting

570
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,620
I try to make this you know the left
side phone relief washed over lighting

571
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,550
it's still pretty unreadable you really
can't it's a useless mass at this point

572
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,450
the phone over here

573
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,680
even though there's a lot to scrawl
going on how many people think if they

574
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,270
pick the phone up that out there got a
chance to locking it

575
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,879
absolutely so I said I let's go back
into it was tight for a while and I have

576
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,110
swype keyboard on my phone some swelling
all over the screen I am

577
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,189
wiping this into leading in typing some
more and I'm going on the web and I'm

578
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,370
reading headlines about funny bullshit
the TSA and scrolling Aaron

579
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,449
got ice tea house where you can still
see the Africa pattern

580
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,850
all right let's go back to the web let's
spend another while reading and I go

581
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,550
through other thing I just taking all
the time I cat and

582
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,740
what app store wanna delete not doing
this and look at that okay how's it look

583
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,860
I can still see the frigate pattern
Jesus

584
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,060
and the moment even if you say come on
Dev don't you break now you how many

585
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,100
people really

586
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,199
you lost the whole bottom of it like you
really can see what's going on here

587
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,740
okay the moment unlock the phone a look
at it again

588
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:21,540
it refreshes the F ring pattern like
this just got WAY worse and way use less

589
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,820
you might be able to guess a few numbers
that I have you don't know how many

590
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,409
did is there are nap and you don't know
what what other and this

591
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,210
you got down or you got up that's pretty
much all you got

592
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,380
so how will you do this anyway with
Patty to this number

593
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,420
on the phone you put away so I wiped it
off

594
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,050
oh my god I guess that kinda kinda makes
it a little hard to see

595
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,620
what if you show up in your pockets and
run up and down your house there's a

596
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,419
buncha times a walk around the
neighborhood

597
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,550
I think we went to get coffee pulling
back out like alright

598
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,570
this does prove that if you keep your
phone in your pocket

599
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:59,159
and not clip to your bell and I know
some your techie people please tell

600
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,840
could be funny about you look horrible

601
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,270
keep your keep your phone in your pocket

602
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,379
if for no other reason than your pattern
can be seen

603
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,310
unless of course you open the lock the
phone and its right the fuck back

604
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:18,350
there is however an even bigger problem

605
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,679
with respect to pattern unlock as
opposed to and

606
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,050
unlock wherever we talked about crypto

607
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,980
and if someone has a pin on lock

608
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,480
on their phone that I say they might be
using crypto

609
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,380
if someone has a pattern lock on their
phone or

610
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,980
rewrite what war so I'm sorry

611
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,460
thanks for playing no you can't use
crypto with with pattern lock

612
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,670
unless they've changed in the latest API
anyone correct me if I'm wrong

613
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,590
the moment you see someone swipe on
locking their phone you know that's not

614
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,620
an encryption device

615
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,929
so for the handful love you who are like
alright I use crypto

616
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,670
can we turn the gamma back down is now
its super bright so some people like

617
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,020
alright well for the three of us that
have our hands up I don't have a pattern

618
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,530
cuz I use crypto

619
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,150
awesome there is still a small problem
with that of

620
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,710
which you like I'm just ruining
everyone's day at this point would you

621
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,220
like to know what the small problem with
the crypto its

622
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:23,129
in almost every case

623
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:27,070
in the Android system if you are using

624
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,740
crew just stock encryption if you go
under you know system menu

625
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:36,029
security encryption set encrypt unless
you're doing like custom search for

626
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,830
something else like mattress does he
smiled back there

627
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,100
ninety percent of the people across a 95
percent the people

628
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,710
using Android encryption your pin lock

629
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,850
is your crypto lock it is the passphrase

630
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,549
for your trip to device so all day long
your unlocking your phone

631
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,510
if anyone can cut a glance at you look
around 10 what is that a seven followed

632
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,420
by an A

633
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,100
now it's a 1337 not douche bag like

634
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,330
that your crib to lock so anyone can
just you know D crypt

635
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,940
your data partition all has sat in it

636
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,010
from but see the thing about that is

637
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,860
you tell this someone I say well I
really want strong crypto but I don't

638
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,910
wanna use

639
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:22,190
a57 character pin every time a locking
my phone I never answer calls

640
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,350
would you believe that some gloriously
cold hearted soul

641
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,089
made a simple command-line that doesn't
sound too good a utility

642
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,760
call crypt FS it just uses the let's get
the best command

643
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,180
if you're rooted to modify your
encryption block password

644
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,259
to whatever you want so you can have a
pen loughlin all my devices they're all

645
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,170
pin lock

646
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,650
and they're all between six and ten
character headlocks all my encryption

647
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:52,400
is fuckin more than that

648
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,500
super easy stuff really easy things you
could do

649
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,620
but how often does you know how often is
weird stuff like this an obscure aP's

650
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,140
get talked about that's why I kinda
paper the talk with these

651
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,670
question yes

652
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,780
I have wanted that for so long Henry St
that can make a scramble pad

653
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,120
unlike things like the dialer and other
parts of the system

654
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,370
where a lot of app scans can swap out

655
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:21,810
be like all get like an increasing
rotary dialer there's some things an

656
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,940
Android you can swap

657
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,800
actually changing how the the unlock is
implemented

658
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,900
is not something you can just do with an
app as far as I know

659
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,610
now if in android dev was making their
own custom ROM

660
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,620
maybe they would get into that and say
all right I'm gonna change out

661
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,810
is the lock screen there's new elements
in the API that let the lockscreen do

662
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,210
things they couldn't do before

663
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,710
volume controls some ap scan scan pop
data in front a lock screen which is

664
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,600
good or bad depending on what you think

665
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,940
but the lock screen itself has remained
relatively fixed

666
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,140
that's not something you see a lot of
people messing with I would adore that

667
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,920
I would definitely get on that and I i
think that the awesome have like

668
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,580
Scrabble Pat phone

669
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,590
so yeah at the moment it happened
somebody email me and I'm gonna like

670
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:09,650
NPR our necks first hi I'm nowhere near
good enough to write any this

671
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,110
yeah please don't let me be mistaking
any I did write any other shit you're

672
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,760
saying

673
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,340
this is me just reading XD a developer's
being like fucking awesome I got some

674
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,430
people about that

675
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,649
cool that's a great exploit I got some
people about that

676
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,950
this is perhaps the coolest things that
i'm gonna talk to you about today

677
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,149
and it's where some of our little live
demo examples will happen

678
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,100
at all pertains to permission hacking

679
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,110
this I this is like if you thought the
nandroid backup stuff was cool

680
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,300
this is the one that my push somebody
over the edge even if the other stuff

681
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,970
didn't

682
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,779
many people now that app swap
permissions

683
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,080
some caps lock a lot of permissions and
unlike

684
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,090
blackberry where you could selectively
say

685
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,730
know this app can communicate over bezar
not bad as a no I don't want this app to

686
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,040
have this or that

687
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,400
permissions and Android are kinda an
all-or-nothing game the app literally

688
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,710
just says

689
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,890
here it is take

690
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:13,089
and you gotta decide whether you're
you're bending over an offer that up

691
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:18,240
starting in CyanogenMod version 7 as far
as I can recall

692
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,470
interesting things don't happen and
people started saying

693
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,120
what the hell do I have to to do this
what the why do you think you need my

694
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,960
location your a freakin calculator app

695
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,630
does math suddenly work different south
of the Equator and people what they like

696
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,370
so CyanogenMod started to have this
ability where if you were looking at the

697
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,560
apt management

698
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,290
if you can manage my absence okay here's
the clear glass if you scroll to the

699
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,890
permissions

700
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,009
you could tap on the permission and just
starting to see that

701
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:51,020
you just cross it out be like nope you
don't get this

702
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,390
people love doing that especially with
games and other kinda nonsense freeware

703
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,230
that wanted

704
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,640
a whole buncha stuff to connect your
phone I want your contacts on your

705
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,480
billing zip

706
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,610
you say no f you now the app some time
said yeah

707
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,780
f you like the absolute crash if they
were usually badly written

708
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,630
you like alright I guess calculator
really did need my location for some

709
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,420
done it then you like I'm glad it's
crashing because I don't want to have

710
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,160
that

711
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,609
but some maps were things people just
couldn't live without like I know I do

712
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,790
you love them Facebook's

713
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,920
I'm not on Facebook and I when I saw the
permissions that Facebook wats

714
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,200
most popular app I think on Android
right now next alike

715
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,230
you know just using the stock browser to
browse around the web look at the

716
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,080
permissions set Facebook what's

717
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,950
its awful its heinous but people kept
having to deal with it because they

718
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,750
didn't want Facebook crashing

719
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,920
some people suspected that they were
offering the app in a way that will

720
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,920
always crash intentionally if you tried
to do this

721
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,600
so this came along instead

722
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,060
CyanogenMod no longer supports just
line-item veto

723
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,660
a permissions but this does

724
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,730
this is Peter Lloyd or the latest
version is open P Droid which runs on

725
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,960
page right manager and things like that

726
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,420
if you google and start learning about
Peter Lloyd

727
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,060
holy balls will you be impressed and
thrilled

728
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,150
when I discovered how this works I was
like oh my god I gotta have

729
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,540
once you start seeing out I gotta go
down though that right now

730
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,040
understand this is not just and ap yes
there is an app

731
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,470
the P droid app is a management
interface so you downloading you're

732
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,660
running this a PK

733
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,170
this does nothing if you don't mod your
system

734
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,210
so that we're talking heavy phone
modding you're talking root access

735
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,790
once you put the P droid framework into
your system

736
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,140
and there's updated scripts that that
you can actually repackage

737
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,230
relatively automated wise you can
repackage Andrea update

738
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,910
to get the framework on your phone its
it's very much a marine corps rifle

739
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,000
thing you know without me my rifle is
useless without my rifle I am useless

740
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,810
if you have both together then you can
just start

741
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,430
smacking down hard on aP's that what
thanks

742
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,500
you can't they even have like pop up
notify know if you want to just sit

743
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,900
there

744
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,200
like Italy be like yeah I leave that can
have it

745
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,000
sucking off facebook you have a GPS
location bite me

746
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,270
yeah it is it is a selective eliminating
tool

747
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,800
see you can just have permissions are
not have permissions interacting with

748
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,100
the fall

749
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:26,690
it is incredible

750
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,760
now just for the sexiness

751
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,780
wifi in a look this is this it looks
like this is the Piedra management or

752
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,820
face

753
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,010
it detects when you're installing new
app settle actually Papa notification

754
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,950
and I'll say oh they're translate just
change the permissions you wanna gonna

755
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,480
fix that

756
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,320
this is what it looks like when you're
in each ap you select a nap

757
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,380
and you can say always permissions that
you think you walk

758
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,440
bite me nope this is my Twitter app I'm
running plume

759
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,130
I don't know why the hell wants any this
I couldn't give a shit

760
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,060
you could have network access that is
all you get you do not pass go you not

761
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,190
get two hundred dollars

762
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,300
and it doesn't crash it's not the old
Scion it in style

763
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,060
now here we start to get a little more
interesting if you really hate

764
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,250
like freeware Daves and you don't know
why the collect data you can a

765
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,900
randomized mode on

766
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,950
so that yeah it'll return data it
overturned random data

767
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:25,379
every single time

768
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,860
yet single like the drummer in our band
Richie he's lead singer is not all I can

769
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,800
somehow this

770
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,180
this is where it gets really funky
though

771
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,250
there's data spoofing

772
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,660
out on Dell acquired what about manually
setting

773
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,680
whatever you want data to be returned to
the zaps

774
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,220
now life gets a little bit interesting
now we're gonna do a couple demos and

775
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,520
things here

776
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,370
perhaps the most hilarious way you can
demo this sorta stuff

777
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:00,299
involves maps because by all means

778
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,400
maps are a great way of talking about
this so here we have

779
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,050
let's see if the a if the light on a
WorkSafe you can kinda see that they're

780
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:13,800
you'll be able to tell in a moment what
we got going on so right now

781
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,350
if I go to Google Maps

782
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,790
I'm allowing Google something's up to
nine Google randomizing Google some

783
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,170
other things

784
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:27,360
so if I drop out to Google Maps were
indoors so unfortunately

785
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,440
I can't get GPS lock most likely

786
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,690
if I was really lucky if we had some
skylights you might get a little GPS

787
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,130
indicator there

788
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,680
but what if we go back to Peter I'd
actually I can probably keep it right

789
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,200
here from memory

790
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,589
so here's maps network location

791
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,680
let's go ahead and randomize that

792
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,859
so where are we where am I in the well
though it

793
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,610
what's okay so we're far out at sea

794
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,470
let's go back again to do that again
hang on let see where where is Carmen

795
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,910
Sandiego

796
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:05,330
I'm near Antarctica something like that
I think

797
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,850
one more time just as fun okay now I was
in norway now I'm not now I'm here now

798
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,410
I'm

799
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:17,410
apparently launching from the sub base
in Poli Rd in Russia

800
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,610
but let's talk about data faking someone
lets go back down to maps

801
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,570
and I could filter and just look at that
so there was our our location

802
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,320
GPS what if I want to say something
manually

803
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,530
what if I wanna say I don't know that
scene nineteen 479

804
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:41,750
ninety the point 479

805
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,070
I got -1 for 5602

806
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:48,870
so it's a negative 155 have

807
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:52,190
60 to or three that's fine too

808
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:57,610
let's save that let's go back into maps

809
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,040
%uh sorry I was supposed to be doing my
talk but I still on the amount you know

810
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,150
my lower cuz I really wanted to see

811
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,500
an active volcano base and I thought
that would be a really cool thing and

812
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,770
I'm sorry I are you can't ask me to come
and talk Jason I am literally here

813
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:15,870
I'll send you a screenshot like what do
you want from me

814
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:19,430
how about something else let's look at
this is just I get I get giddy with this

815
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,419
stuff man

816
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,440
I love doing this

817
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,150
bicep the GPS cord into the move would
probably be pretty pretty far off I

818
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,400
don't know

819
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,150
but how about 21 St 21.94

820
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:42,910
and then we'll give that a negative 160

821
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,140
points 20 long-term or just point 20

822
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,140
let's go let's go with that alright so
save that

823
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,850
and alright I'll now look out

824
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:59,450
where am I going %uh got how is a little
bit Islands

825
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,990
somebody westley public

826
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,779
ok oh man so like that's funny right
that's

827
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,960
we're just appear to fit around and shit

828
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,890
well let's talk about some other
possibilities with this

829
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:18,410
and as Evan booth likes to say before
his talks

830
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:23,480
that are really up you know shaking some
people up boy do I love me some America

831
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,820
so any government agents listening just
bear that in mind

832
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,780
think about the stuff you could do with
aP's that leave breadcrumbs online

833
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,350
the most of us don't like that we're
leaving bread crumbs all over the

834
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,220
internet right

835
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,330
what about the fact that when you tweet
half the time you can't act like

836
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,370
you like who the fuck whatever geotagged
their tweets

837
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:46,100
I can tell you my geotagged tweets I
think a lot of interesting possibilities

838
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,360
for messing around with your data that
your phone thinks you're where you are

839
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,200
and what you're doing

840
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,939
now gets more interesting i mean the map
stuff it's practically a parlor trick

841
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,540
there are a lot of settings and a lot of
details about

842
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,910
mobile devices that unless you are a
line man or someone in the mobile

843
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:07,819
industry

844
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,920
you don't know a lot of these terms mean

845
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,210
but if i spelling out for you know
they're pretty for important

846
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,970
back in the day all the sort of
information the IMEI

847
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:22,259
the MTN the all of that that was just

848
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,790
in the phone I was that was either hard
coated on your Sam which would talk

849
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,870
direct to the phone

850
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,930
or was burned into the phone

851
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:34,950
and there was a lot of phone hacking to
be done back in the days we all had Rex

852
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:38,410
the only phone hacking that you can do
with this is like turn it into an IUD

853
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,240
basically

854
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,479
let's go to be a helluva day for the DOD
guy right with the one missed call

855
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,670
let's

856
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,380
come but foale's

857
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,780
back before you know smartphones this
was all this hard coded stuff there was

858
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,030
a

859
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,899
you know this is something the idea of
hacking this was crazy

860
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,960
modern phones handle all this shit

861
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,370
in software yes it is burned into

862
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:10,400
various chips on the phone in the SIM
card itself

863
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,820
but its actually handled at the entry
level before talks to the radio

864
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,400
out to the network in software

865
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,540
and I first learned this when I had a

866
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,580
I was my a ruggedized phone though the
Motorola Defy

867
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,180
I had broken up the screen badly on my
defy

868
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,350
as all shit I'm glad I have those
backups got a new one

869
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,990
to the warranty program pushed back up
onto it

870
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:39,220
awesome to work in said the old one back
to the to up you know to

871
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,240
suree on and if you delete a phone
stopped working

872
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,169
it would run but it wouldn't connect any
towers like what the hell is

873
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,470
Effen going on I'm checking I'm tryna
swapping SIM cards

874
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,390
I don't know what was wrong eventually I
just had to go to T Mobile

875
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,390
and they start flipping through with a
like well this hang on

876
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,500
list doesn't make sense sometimes there
on the phone and the like

877
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,740
you you were supposed to overturn this
but what if I can talk

878
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,930
this is the IMEI up the phone number
that you did you send the wrong phone

879
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,190
back

880
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:13,050
and I'm like no the wrong phone as a
screen that looks like a rhino stepped

881
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:13,710
on it

882
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:18,530
so this is not a phone like will know
this IMEI is blocked from our network

883
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:22,109
because that's already been catalogued
back and I was the first time I realize

884
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:23,779
that by pushing it out

885
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,850
there's now that's been changed a little
bit now doesn't quite work that way with

886
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,710
ghost in your phone anymore but

887
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:33,210
yet this is all emulated in software

888
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:37,920
so you can do some really crazy things

889
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,590
and before I show this video I would
just point out

890
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:46,990
how to say this there is no way to prove
that this video was shot

891
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,120
in the United States

892
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:55,589
my good

893
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:59,810
we have no video what's going on there
somebody already

894
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,400
took my advice is that no don't show
that video

895
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:10,400
cell my go after the same

896
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:17,009
for the left flank go work

897
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:24,010
and it's completely severed on as

898
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,890
now we go ahead and look in the system
said

899
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,980
these that's up

900
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,839
totally

901
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:35,340
not be on this camera I wasn't doing

902
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,570
see my reflection

903
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,740
at all I know as a hobby all the white
something

904
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,330
was not that such as the small holding
it up there's an idea I don't learn

905
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,650
I yes phone

906
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:51,890
now normally you should be able to have
the same IMEI number and everything else

907
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,029
on another phone thats ok on network

908
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,620
but if you do

909
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:03,620
sometimes things like this happen XO
these

910
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,780
by

911
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,920
as

912
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,160
yeah from so yeah

913
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,950
we talk to counsel about this they

914
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,509
didn't really want us they said no you
know I when are we recording the stocks

915
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:29,390
that was realized that

916
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:33,990
alright didn't know that we have the
recording in previous years

917
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,100
presented without comment

918
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:42,920
just sayin so what does this all boil
down to

919
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,660
in terms of how we can do the best
things we can with your phone's

920
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,970
first of all don't pull shit like that

921
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:53,560
ever but most of all

922
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,759
maintain physical control your device
for all reasons at all times

923
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,560
don't plug random things into the ports
even if you know

924
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,600
you like I'll check out these awesome
new charges we got we are again we were

925
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,549
duke's last night

926
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,550
everyone start pulling up she got this
charger thing I got

927
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:12,030
I got this battery pack I get that all
in this was so cool

928
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,369
you can crack these overlooking that
there's a lot of space

929
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:19,530
wears a bed space the all battery if you
put a couple a little

930
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:23,400
you know quien batteries and a lot of
circuitry that's doing malicious things

931
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,109
I bet you could package that all backup
in a way no one's gonna notice

932
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:31,500
and you plug that in say oh you're
running low on your phone here you go

933
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,070
BAM if you are really serious about your
security I wouldn't trust

934
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,609
so I would just grab visit get me you
know but he just looks shady

935
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:44,290
oh okay let's look at his bag o tricks
that he is pulling out right here like

936
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:50,700
holy crap sir pull it up

937
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,379
yet ok

938
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,030
yeah this is a better so this is a
teensy

939
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:04,040
inside look at this

940
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,580
like it was custom-made to turn into an
exploit platform

941
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:12,330
Chaka Khan talk next year right here you
go

942
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:17,730

reason than we know prism Israel and

945
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,240
everything like that

946
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,959
VPN your shit because you're a hacker
con

947
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,270
use proper passphrase is when you do yes
I know their long use keep asteroid

948
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:37,240
please lock your device and if you're
doing that anyway please encrypt your

949
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:37,970
device

950
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:42,200
by the way you know that means you power
it of when you're going through

951
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,520
checkpoints in places where you think
your phone might be confiscated

952
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,440
that's why you're using a long pass
phrase if you just lock in the screen

953
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,490
what the hell you don't

954
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:53,080
don't install random bullshit should go
without saying

955
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,569
like free money factory like seems legit
right onto give that all the provisions

956
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,369
in the world will work out fine

957
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:04,810
use P droid Locker App step even a happy
like that looks legit lock the hell out

958
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,240
of it

959
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,890
lock your permissions and backed up and
securely worst you know keep your stuff

960
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:09,319
of

961
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,390
offs of device do this and you're in
pretty good shape

962
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:17,779
and I give me the light so if you if you
ever want to worry about you know

963
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:21,750
oh my god I think something happened
here is your here is your process if you

964
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,720
worry about stuff

965
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,580
if something kinda fishy happens you
like who was that I was the person just

966
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,590
have my phone

967
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,480
do you think the ship plug that into
something there to that waitress what

968
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,420
she plugged in behind the bar what to
she look suspicious to you

969
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,270
if you think something happened you boot
into recovery you wipe

970
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:41,060
your main partitions and you just
restore um from unknown good backup

971
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,310
then you can like a cash such a bad idea

972
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:48,980
if you think something really fishies
happened like an actual bad actor or

973
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,420
authority figure has had your device for
a while

974
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,670
never know these things are what it is
South what is the product to make this

975
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,590
cell right if anybody from an authority
type

976
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:03,250
you know especially a foreign authority
ever has your phone

977
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:07,280
I personally wouldn't even trust the
recovery image at that point I boot into

978
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,080
Facebook or download mode push

979
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,470
a known clean recovery back onto the
phone boo to that recovery

980
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:17,459
then from the encrypt it back up with
you know nobody messed with

981
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,480
push that out fresh if

982
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,660
you think something really really bad
has happened like your phone was

983
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,000
probably confiscated and taken to a lab
somewhere

984
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,560
or you were had confiscated at the
border and they sent it back to you

985
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,890
through counsel three months later

986
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:37,140
the hell you doing just fuckin ditch the
phone

987
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,839
these don't cost that much people or
keep it off and then send it to your

988
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,200
tech can be like make a backup to see
what's on it

989
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,210
just get a new damn phone get a spare
phone

990
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,230
just wipe and push on to a new phone its
how much

991
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:53,500
is your stuff really worth that this
convenience is too hard

992
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,590
you can't be bothered to migrate in all
this content

993
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:00,960
that you try so hard to protect on your
laptop

994
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,340
why are you leaving your phone so wide
open and if not for the sake

995
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,000
love your actual work product the photos
you take a vacation

996
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,640
that you don't want people to see what
happened when you're in a foreign place

997
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,529
with an expense account

998
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,990
so thank you for listening thank you for
having fun this is cool for me and I'm

two questions but I'm also I'm gonna be

other no no

1003
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:38,760
thanks again on another round of
applause for the VIN is always give a

1004
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,890
talk by

1005
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:42,890
here's your his ear out your order

1006
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,970
oh yeah okay we're

1007
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,299
give me a call we are one or two
questions for din when

1008
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:55,390
heavies multi ROM

1009
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:59,710
um only on tablets I've never booted my
phone with multi ROM I know you did a

1010
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,010
lot on your Nexus with a right

1011
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:04,440
so

1012
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,579
multi wrong you start getting into other
miscellaneous partitions

1013
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:12,220
you get into like St extend partitions

1014
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,328
its its way were complicated as you're
right on that diagram can represent

1015
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:20,380
it it is just extra partitions and the
boot partition gets smarter

1016
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,470
but its actually a little above my pay
grade I've played with it

1017
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,959
to make like this will be my attack mode
tablet or my regular tablet

1018
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,579
but I've never been great with it so
it's a valuable question another one yes

1019
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:34,700
you get a drink for asking a question
about yes

1020
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,129
hmm

1021
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:47,130
out yet so

1022
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,490
this question is what about if you use
the page right framework and in the

1023
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,399
management app

1024
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,220
you said all these permissions Eve
locked all down but then you change your

1025
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:56,790
all

1026
00:57:56,790 --> 00:58:00,420
what happens the actual permission
database

1027
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,720
I don't know where it lives it probably
is a function of the management app

1028
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,649
is fairly independent so I've been able
to

1029
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,250
delete an app and then install new
version that app

1030
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:15,170
and it still has the permissions that
I'd last set so I if you can keep the

1031
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:15,849
permission

1032
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:19,150
database I'm betting it's tied to

1033
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:24,000
the actual a PK so com dot tweet or dot
whatever dot it's a reversion

1034
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,630
I think that will happen but that's a
that's a better you ask I made roti the

1035
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,760
other guys on XT a who make be dried

1036
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,050
and that's about it yeah alright

1037
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:37,329
okay so are we gonna break for lunch

1038
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:40,369
and then we're gonna have some turbo
talks

1039
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:44,520

1040

1049
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:19,859
gift cards GoPro cameras X bar x-box
connect Kindle Fire

1050
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:24,029
walk Google Nexus and some other stuff
so go ahead and visit the sponsors get

1051
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:24,550
the

1052
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:29,410
a the little hashed values and that girl
register those

1053
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:32,710
I and yeah much is out there in the back
back left corner

1054
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:36,020
well

1055
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:39,920
that's fun data you can a randomized
mode on

1056
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,380
so that yeah it'll return data it
overturned random data

1057
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:50,099
every single time yet single like

1058
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:53,890
the drummer in our band Richie he's lead
singer is not like I'm time I this

1059
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,440
this is where it gets really funky
though

1060
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:04,440
there's data spoofing now the room
Dellacqua what about manually setting

1061
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:08,970
whatever you want data to be returned to
the zaps

1062
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:13,640
now life gets a little bit interesting
now we're gonna do a couple demos and

1063
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,279
things here

1064
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,050
perhaps the most hilarious way you can
demo this sorta stuff

1065
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:22,890
involves maps because by all means

1066
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,950
maps are a great way of talking about
this

1067
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:31,029
so here we have let's see if the a if
the light on a WorkSafe you can kinda

1068
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:31,829
see that they're

1069
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:35,500
you'll be able to tell a moment what we
got going on

1070
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:42,500
so right now if I go to Google Maps I'm
allowing Google some things I'm 29

1071
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,589
Google randomizing Google some other
things

1072
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:50,779
so if I drop out to Google Maps were
indoors so unfortunately

1073
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,859
I can't get GPS lock most likely

1074
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:57,119
if I was really lucky if we had some
skylights you might get a little GPS

1075
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,550
indicator there

1076
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:02,109
but what if we go back to Peter I'd
actually I can probably keep it right

1077
01:01:02,109 --> 01:01:03,619
here from memory

1078
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:07,010
so here's maps network location

1079
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,109
let's go ahead and randomize ac

1080
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:14,290
so where are we where am I in the well
though it

1081
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:20,040
what's okay so we're were out at sea

1082
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,900
let's go back again to do that again
hang on let see where where is Carmen

1083
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,330
Sandiego

1084
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:28,759
I'm near Antarctica something like that
I think

1085
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,270
one more time just as fun okay now I was
in norway now I'm not now I'm here now

1086
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:33,830
I'm

1087
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:40,830
apparently launching from the sub base
in Poli Rd in Russia

1088
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:48,040
but let's talk about data faking someone
lets go back down to maps

1089
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:52,000
and I could filter and just look at that
so there was our our location

1090
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,750
GPS what if I want to say something
manually

1091
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:59,950
what if I wanna say I don't know that
scene nineteen 479

1092
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:05,180
19 point 479

1093
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,490
I got -1 her 5602

1094
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:12,299
so it's a negative 15 the

1095
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,619
60 to or three that's fine too

1096
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:21,030
let's save that let's go back into maps

1097
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:24,460
%uh sorry I was supposed to be doing my
talk but I stood on the amount you know

1098
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,569
my lower cuz I really wanted to see

1099
01:02:26,569 --> 01:02:29,930
an active volcano base and I thought
that would be a really cool thing and

1100
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:34,190
I'm sorry I are you can't ask me to come
and talk Jason I am literally here

1101
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:39,290
I'll send you a screenshot like what do
you want from me

1102
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,849
how about something else let's look at
this is just I get I get giddy with this

1103
01:02:42,849 --> 01:02:43,849
stuff man

1104
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:46,869
I love doing this

1105
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:52,569
bicep the GPS cord into the move would
probably be pretty pretty far off I

1106
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:53,819
don't know

1107
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:59,569
but how about 21 St 21.94

1108
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:06,330
and then we'll give that a negative 160

1109
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:10,569
points20 long-term or just point 20

1110
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:15,560
let's go let's go with that alright so
save that

1111
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,279
and alright I'll now look out

1112
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,880
where am I going %uh got how is a little
bit Islands

1113
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,410
somebody westley like

1114
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:30,200
ok oh man so like that's funny right
that's

1115
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,390
we're just appear to fit around and shit

1116
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:38,310
well let's talk about some other
possibilities with this

1117
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:41,830
and as Evan booth likes to say before
his talks

1118
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:46,910
that are really up you know shaking some
people up boy do I love me some America

1119
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,240
so any government agents listening just
bear that in mind

1120
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,200
think about the stuff you could do with
aP's that leave breadcrumbs online

1121
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,770
the most of us don't like that we're
leaving bread crumbs all over the

1122
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:58,650
internet right

1123
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,750
what about the fact that when you tweet
half the time you can't act like

1124
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,790
you like who the fuck whatever geotagged
their tweets

1125
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:09,520
I can tell you my geotagged tweets I
think a lot of interesting possibilities

1126
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,780
for messing around with your data that
your phone thinks you're where you are

1127
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:17,619
and what you're doing

1128
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:22,359
now gets more interesting i mean the map
stuff it's practically a parlor trick

1129
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,970
there are a lot of settings and a lot of
details about

1130
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:30,339
mobile devices that unless you are a
line man or someone in the mobile

1131
01:04:30,339 --> 01:04:31,240
industry

1132
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,339
you don't know what a lot of these terms
mean

1133
01:04:34,339 --> 01:04:38,630
but if i spelling out for you know
they're pretty for important

1134
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:43,119
back in the day all the sort of
information the IMEI the MTN the

1135
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,589
all of that that was just in the phone I
was

1136
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:50,290
that was either hard coated on your Sam
which would talk direct to the phone

1137
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:53,359
or was burned into the phone

1138
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:58,369
and there was a lot of phone hacking to
be done back in the days we all had Rex

1139
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:01,830
the only phone hacking that you can do
with this is like turn it into an IUD

1140
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:04,660
basically

1141
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,899
that's got to be a helluva day for the
DOD guy right with the one missed call

1142
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:12,089
let's

1143
01:05:12,089 --> 01:05:15,810
come but foale's

1144
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:20,210
back before you know smartphones this
was all this hard coded stuff there was

1145
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:20,460
a

1146
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:24,330
you know this is something the idea of
hacking this was crazy

1147
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:27,380
modern phones handle all this shit

1148
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,790
in software yes it is burned into

1149
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:33,830
various ships on the phone and the SIM
card itself

1150
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:38,240
but its actually handled at the entry
level before talks to the radio

1151
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,810
out to the network in software

1152
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:44,970
and I first learned this when I had a

1153
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:48,020
I was my a ruggedized phone though the
Motorola Defy

1154
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:51,599
I had broken up the screen badly on my
defy

1155
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,770
as all shit long glad I have those
backups got a new one

1156
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:58,420
to the warranty program pushed back up
onto it

1157
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:01,470
awesome twerkin said the old one back to
the

1158
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:05,669
to up you know to suree on and if you
delete a phone stopped working

1159
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,599
it would run but it wouldn't connect to
any towers like what the hell is

1160
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,890
Effen going on I'm checking I'm tryna
swapping SIM cards

1161
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:16,819
I don't know what was wrong eventually I
just had to go to T Mobile

1162
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:20,420
and they start flipping through with a
like well this hang on list doesn't make

1163
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,250
sense sometimes there on the phone

1164
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,580
and the like you you were supposed to
overturn this

1165
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:28,710
but what if I can talk this is the IMEI

1166
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:32,619
up the phone number that you did you
send the wrong phone back

1167
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:36,480
and I'm like no the wrong phone as a
screen that looks like a rhino stepped

1168
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,130
on it

1169
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:41,950
so this is not a phone like will know
this IMEI is block from our network

1170
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:45,529
because that's already been catalogued
back and I was the first time I realize

1171
01:06:45,529 --> 01:06:47,210
that by pushing it out

1172
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:50,270
there's now that's been changed a little
bit now doesn't quite work that way with

1173
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,109
ghost in your phone anymore but

1174
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:56,640
yet this is all emulated in software

1175
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:01,348
so you can do some really crazy things

1176
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:06,020
and before I show this video I would
just point out

1177
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:10,410
how to say this there is no way to prove
that this video was shot

1178
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:13,560
in the United States

1179
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:19,020
movies good

1180
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:23,230
we have no video what's going on there
somebody already

1181
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:26,819
took my advice is that no don't show
that video

1182
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:33,819
cell my go after the same

1183
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:40,430
for the left Frank go work

1184
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:47,430
and it's completely severed on as

1185
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,330
now the go-ahead and look in the system
said

1186
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:54,040
these

1187
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,430
that's on

1188
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:56,259
totally

1189
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,250
not be on this camera I wasn't doing

1190
01:07:59,250 --> 01:07:59,990
election

1191
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:03,140
at all but know that something all the
white something

1192
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:07,000
was not that such as the small holding
it up as idid

1193
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,070
yes phone

1194
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:15,310
now normally you should be able to have
the same IMEI number and everything else

1195
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:16,769
on another phone this

1196
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:18,449
network

1197
01:08:18,448 --> 01:08:25,448
but if you do sometimes things like this
happen accidentally these

1198
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:34,859
by

1199
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:39,270
is

1200
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:44,589
yeah so yeah

1201
01:08:44,589 --> 01:08:48,380
we talk to counsel about this they

1202
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,929
didn't really want us they said no you
know I when are we recording the stocks

1203
01:08:51,929 --> 01:08:52,658
that Israel is

1204
01:08:52,658 --> 01:08:57,408
alright didn't know that we have the
recording in previous years

1205
01:08:57,408 --> 01:09:00,528
presented without comment

1206
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:06,350
just sayin so what does this all boil
down to

1207
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:10,089
in terms of how we can do the best
things we can with your phone's

1208
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:13,389
first of all don't pull shit like that

1209
01:09:13,389 --> 01:09:16,980
ever but most of all

1210
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:21,178
maintain physical control your device
for all reasons at all times

1211
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:24,989
don't plug random things into the ports
even if you know

1212
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:28,019
you like I'll check out these awesome
new charges we got we are again we were

1213
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:28,980
duke's last night

1214
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:32,879
everyone start pulling up she got this
charger thing I got I got this battery

1215
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,469
pack I get they all look at this one is
so cool

1216
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:38,790
you can crack these open look in there
there's a lot of space

1217
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:42,948
wears a bed space the all battery if you
put a couple a little

1218
01:09:42,948 --> 01:09:46,818
you know quien batteries and a lot of
circuitry that's doing malicious things

1219
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:50,529
I bet you could package that all backup
in a way no one's gonna notice

1220
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:54,940
and you plug that in say oh you're
running low on your phone here you go

1221
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:59,489
fam if you are really serious about your
security I wouldn't trust

1222
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:03,030
so I would transcribe visit get me you
know but he just looks shady

1223
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:07,710
0 looking listless bag o tricks that he
is pulling out right here like

1224

1227
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:25,320
so this is a teensy inside

1228
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,429
look at this like it was custom-made

1229
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:35,710
to turn into an exploit platform Chaka
Khan talk next year right here you go

1234
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:52,388
VPN your shit because you're a hacker
con

1235

01:11:01,389 --> 01:11:05,620
by the way you know that means you power
it of when you're going through

1239
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:09,130
checkpoints in places where you think
your phone might be confiscated that's

1240
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:11,860
why you're using a long pass phrase if
you just lock in the screen

1241
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,349
what the hell you don't don't install

01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,770
of

1248
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:36,770
offs of device do this and you're in
pretty good shape

1249
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:41,199
and I give me the light so if you if you
ever want to worry about you know

1250
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:45,169
oh my god I think something happened
here is your here's your process if you

1251
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,150
worry about stuff

1252
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:50,000
if something kinda fishy happens you
like who was that I was the person just

1253
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,020
have my phone

1254
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,900
the sink the ship plug that into
something there to that waitress what

1255
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,388
she plugged in behind the bar what

1256
01:11:55,389 --> 01:11:58,760
to she look suspicious to you if you
think something happened you boot into

1257
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,500
recovery

1258
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,260
you wipe your main partitions and you
just restore um

1259
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:07,030
from unknown good backup than you can
like a cash

1260
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:10,500
such a bad idea if you think something
really fishies happened

1261
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,770
like an actual bad actor or authority
figure has had your device for a while

1262
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:18,670
never know with these things are what it
is Saudi what is the product to make

1263
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:19,090
this

1264
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:23,010
cell right if anybody from an authority
type

1265
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,690
you know especially a foreign authority
ever has your phone

1266
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:30,710
I personally wouldn't even trust the
recovery image at that point I boot into

1267
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:32,000
Facebook or download mode

1268
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,320
push a known clean recovery back onto
the phone

1269
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,150
boo to that recovery then from the
encrypt it back up with you know nobody

1270
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:40,879
messed with

1271
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,989
push that out fresh if you think
something

1272
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:49,739
really really bad has happened like your
phone was probably confiscated and taken

1273
01:12:49,739 --> 01:12:51,428
to a lab somewhere

1274
01:12:51,429 --> 01:12:54,980
or you were had confiscated at the
border and they sent it back to you

1275
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:57,339
through counsel three months later

1276
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:00,570
the hell you doing just fuckin ditch the
phone

1277
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:04,269
these don't cost that much people or
keep it off and then send it to your

1278
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:06,620
tech can be like make a backup to see
what's on it

1279
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:09,630
just get a new damn phone get a spare
phone

1280
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:12,650
just wipe and push on to a new phone its
how much

1281
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:16,929
is your stuff really worth that this
convenience is too hard

1282
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:21,020
you can't be bothered to migrate in all
this content

1283
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,389
that you try so hard to protect on your
laptop

1284
01:13:24,389 --> 01:13:27,760
why are you leaving your phone so wide
open and if not for the sake

1285
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,429
love your actual work product the photos
you take a vacation

1286
01:13:31,429 --> 01:13:34,060
that you don't want people to see what
happened when you're in a foreign place

1287
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:35,949
with an expense account

1288
01:13:35,949 --> 01:13:39,419
so thank you for listening thank you for
having fun this is cool for me and I'm

01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:52,360

questions but I'm also I'm gonna be in

all set up so

1292
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,140
sorry we ran long time on that one any
other no no

1293
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:03,310
thanks again one another on a positive
in his eyes give a talk by

1294
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:07,650
here's your his ear out your order oh
yeah

1295
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:13,339
okay we're Yemeni I gloria one or two
questions for din

1296
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:18,810
you want heavies multi ROM

1297
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:23,130
um only on tablets I've never booted my
phone with multi ROM I know you did a

1298
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,430
lot on your Nexus with a right

1299
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:27,860
so

1300
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:32,000
multi wrong you start getting into other
miscellaneous partitions

1301
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,650
you get into like St extend partitions

1302
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:39,759
its is way more complicated as you're
right on that diagram can represent

1303
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,810
it it is just extra partitions and the
boot partition gets smarter

1304
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,890
but its actually a little above my pay
grade I've played with it

1305
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:50,730
to make like this will be my attack mode
tablet or my regular tablet but I've

1306
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:51,910
never been great with it

1307
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:55,010
so it's a valuable question another one
yes

1308
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:58,130
you get a drink for asking a question
about yes

1309
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:03,550
hmm

1310
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:10,550
out yet so

1311
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:14,910
this question is what about if you use
the page right framework and in the

1312
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:15,830
management app

1313
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:20,390
you set all these permissions Eve locked
all down but then you change your rock

1314
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,840
what happens the actual permission
database

1315
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,170
I don't know where it lives it probably
is a function of the management app

1316
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:31,070
is fairly independent so I've been able
to

1317
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:34,610
delete an app and then install new
version that app

1318
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:38,589
and it still has the permissions that
I'd last set so I if you can keep the

1319
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:39,270
permission

1320
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:42,570
database I'm betting it's tied to

1321
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:47,420
the actual a PK so com dot tweet or dot
whatever dot it's a reversion

1322
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:50,780
I think that will happen but that's a
that's a better

1323
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:55,590
you ask I made roti the other guys on XT
a who make be dried

1324
01:15:55,590 --> 01:16:00,760
and that's about it yeah alright okay so
are we gonna break for lunch

1325
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,780
and then we're gonna have some turbo
talks

1326
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:07,950
coming up a during lunch the few I come
back in here and catch those

1327
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:12,389
