1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,619
pretty interesting these two guys met a
studying at Harvard

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,798
us that a convergence of I don't think
bob yet didn't really have any security

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,130
back on it time

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,179
did you heard I just some classes last
night after I and then

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:14,639
Ryan you know being information security
person they came together in

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,650
a clobbered honestok says I think some
really good looking for here

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,038
so him warm rather applause welcome

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:29,039
I'm later

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:36,060
just new

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,360
their lou lou

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,400
help I

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:58,400
call it's going to be difficult if I was
here okay

13
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,150
good afternoon

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,100
so I we're going to talk about and
ethics in Information Security

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,369
so first let me get through the
introductions first

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,880
so my name is Ryan and as such cases
said

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,910
obvious there rather get his cell more

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,950
thorough introduction When a his spot

19
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:27,950
but for me

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,390
re single-shot fun ever even the one in
a

21
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,640
I think that was it go to write or
something yet

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,160
the very first light so it's really nice
to see so

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,280
all faces here I see like all school
shop

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,570
on sure and all that stuff and I'm
really happy that to see

25
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,258
you faces as well so thank you very much
for coming to shop

26
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,830
so back to me so

27
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,490
what's new with me shameless plug soho

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,250
said several several several months ago

29
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,709
a I release the book with my co author
and

30
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,009
host of shock on mister Jason margin

31
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,859
yep so its

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,140
itself it's doing okay

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,880
meaning my mommy that France

34
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,079
yeah it's it yeah

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,209
I see this doing it's going okay but
it's not going to be the next Harry

36
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:29,810
Potter

37
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,310
so anyway I mention the book

38
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,819
because this stop is actually based on a
new book that we are working right now

39
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:38,739
with up

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,220
same publisher saying grace so it's
called information security and it makes

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,970
finding insights Packers

42
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,090
an anomaly so this stock is actually an
excerpt all

43
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,060
a two of the chapters one is about
simulations

44
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,120
and one is about big data and above will
be talking about big data

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,150
very trendy and very a a

46
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,210
what you call trendy topic and

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,520
simulations is not its trendy not this
popular

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,860
but I'm going to talk about it anyway
cell going to talk about simulations

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,090
so let's talk about simulations so
basically simulations

50
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,140
are simply put a computers

51
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,549
that reflect or imitate a real-life
scenarios so for example you have an

52
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,220
assembly line

53
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,470
so you have a simulation a fun
assembly-line so it's a place that

54
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,640
so why do we to simulation so
simulations are far too thinks

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,709
optimization and analysis for

56
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,350
first one optimization basically what we
need to do their

57
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,680
is like find the best possible solution
for a certain problem

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,880
or scenario so for analysis what we do
there

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,810
is like what its so what did we do this
what if we do that

60
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,100
so what are the results of each of those
scenarios

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,160
so basically optimization analysis
that's all you need to think about

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,650
why were you seen nation so who uses
simulations

63
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,190
so it's very his simulations is in very
high demand

64
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:15,079
like medicine military operations
management like for example here

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,829
here's a simulation helicopter combat
mission

66
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,169
like me at myself like I got started in
simulations

67
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:28,409
doing like medical informatics like a
putting layouts of emergency rule

68
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,100
said on the that kind of stuff so that's
how I got into this

69
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,919
kinda thing so it's not enough not too
popular

70
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,508
in information security a fortune but I
think it can be used

71
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,100
and I think it's a something that all of
us should

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,910
try touching like that like I try trying

73
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,479
as well so anyway so what I think up

74
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,068
us simulations can be use foreign
securities because

75
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:59,150
we have a lot of security with a lot of
security data

76
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,198
it's possible to forecast possible
resources scenario so do more with it

77
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:03,870
with my

78
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,310
examples a little bit later so knowing
by forecasting

79
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,360
possible resources scenarios we can
define security policies

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,120
make decisions in all of that kind of
stuff so

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,710
know you know what the basic idea of a
simulation

82
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,349
yes so that assimilation its go now to
the morn eighty gritty stuff

83
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:29,909
so their stool modeling paradigm for
simulations

84
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,650
so think about this types types of
simulations we have

85
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,859
discrete event simulation he called this
the ES

86
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,219
in system dynamics let's stop first
about system dynamics

87
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:44,810
so system dynamics think of system
dynamics

88
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,340
s just an equation an equation

89
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,080
that reflects assistant for a system
change

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,550
but we're not going to talk about
simulations because I mean

91
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,629
we are going to talk about immigration
about now

92
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:02,400
so but we're not going to talk about
system dynamics

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,159
because at has a lot of math we have
equations

94
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:09,599
we didn't come here for that day so
anyway so but

95
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,430
one thing that I i that should take a
look here

96
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,449
is this is actually like very popular

97
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,879
equation of the simulation the hunt
their prey simulations you've probably

98
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,860
seen that

99
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,319
like that look it up in Google you find
that there's a lot of simulations like

100
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:25,710
that

101
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,830
hunter break kinda think so so that's
basically like a system dynamics but

102
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,729
we're not going to

103
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:34,919
my system dynamics we're going to talk
about the other one

104
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,960
that discrete event simulations so in my
opinion

105
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,719
like yessir discrete event simulation is

106
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,539
by far the easiest the model in terms of
simulations and

107
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,680
I think it's more of a match like
real-life scenarios

108
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,689
in the theme here you need to think
about in discrete-event simulations

109
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,809
is peace model us the creat

110
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:02,759
discrete entities so you're probably
wondering what are discrete

111
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,969
entity so as anyone like played here
like since

112
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,430
assumes simpson's seems so

113
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,749
basically seems when you're when a

114
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,819
so in like the same so for example this
is a shopping mall

115
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,129
those discrete entities are actually
like the people

116
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:24,870
so in that combat scenario that I showed
you the discrete entities are actually

117
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,629
the

118
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,949
like the helicopters and stuff so let's
say you have like a thousand people

119
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,860
in shopping mall your recreating I
wasn't

120
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,419
different entities thousand different
objects so that's

121
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,128
discrete event simulations not only is
it like a

122
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:45,439
easier to work with it's like with
prettier and integration

123
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,639
so aside from that like a discrete-event
simulation sits there

124
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,830
fairly easy a fairly a has some

125
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,969
advantageous like for example it's easy
to put like logic rules will talk about

126
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,289
logic rules later when we get into

127
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:02,650
are some of the example set I'll show
you then

128
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,270
it's also very easy to visualize you
actually see it

129
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,529
you see the simulation happening not
compared to like an equation right you

130
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,270
just see like a graph

131
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,589
and stuff it's very easy to interpret
and for me

132
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:20,110
what I really like about it it has many
user-friendly software available

133
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,669
so in this spectacular presentation
we're going to

134
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,299
RBC arena so it's at pretty nifty
simulation software

135
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,650
there's also sup XE some other software
like mad model simulate

136
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,620
and there's also like some other open
source stop like a

137
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,940
net logo stuff like that but for now

138
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,159
we're going to show you Irene so

139
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,960
you can see here arena one thing that I
need to tell you sorry no yes

140
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,050
unfortunately not

141
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,439
open source but it does have a student
edition which cancer-free

142
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,360
itself pretty much has like all the all
the

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,950
a bells and whistles up prohibition

144
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,980
though can't handle a lot Aflac discrete

145
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,040
entities so this is what arena looks
like

146
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,870
kinda like visual so

147
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,360
okie simulation with arena so what I
like about every nice it's very flexible

148
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,839
and customizable

149
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,320
you can like specify entities that you
can like

150
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,410
visualize everything you'll see like
anti-peace going around to see what's

151
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,810
actually happening

152
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,839
in the simulation what's also need about
it

153
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,170
is you can find a guy like a lot of
statistics and reports functions

154
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,860
arena so you'll see like what's happened
you'll get an idea what

155
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,390
all this is about when I show you that
examples a little bit later

156
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,000
so and what's neat about this is no
coding required

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,450
you can go can you signed EVA

158
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,540
but for all intents and purposes you can

159
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,770
if you know how to use visual you can
use every

160
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,310
so it's very very very visual like

161
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,569
so so

162
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,820
find like my a a last part of that part
will be top

163
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,590
I'll be talking about like simulation
examples using arena

164
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,410
so the thing here is like I can't really
go fortunately I can't like a

165
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,719
I show you create like some creating a
simulation from scratch

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,220
in 10 minutes but why the thinkers like
a

167
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,700
says after this is a break I can I you
can like just grab me there

168
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,730
and we can do like many workshop or
something if you want

169
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,260
actually wanted like that create
simulations it's very simple

170
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,270
I can teach like really fast but very
simple stuff

171
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,410
not that type of thing said showing here

172
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,660
and the size that like a you can also
download stuff like that

173
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,750
like all my life a visually I think

174
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,510
my simulation examples are here and I
also have like a

175
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,550
a copy of arena here so please don't
download is kinda large in I know that

176
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,010
life I might be like

177
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,060
to swap and stuff so but I have it here

178
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,770
and don't worry this is not a pink this
about social engineer you

179
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,930
so so I have it all here so

180
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,500
let's go through like the simulation
examples now I have a couple of a

181
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,230
simulation examples that I wanted to
show you

182
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,640
before I go away have the big data stuff
done

183
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,790
so what I will do hi what I will be
doing is a zombie

184
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,520
simulation but not this on be

185
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,540
the S&P seriously this song

186
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,650
so so I'm going to talk about

187
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,730
you guys guys guy who watched what did
well I see

188
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,150
up a big some so

189
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:46,010
important thing with the simulation is
to have a scenario

190
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,270
and have a problem a question that you
need to answer

191
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,260
so here that's a there's 170 people in a
conference room

192
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,490
there is one door in once on be

193
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,660
Anders the door I would have been cooler
if I actually had one of

194
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,850
our guys like years on be in stopping
walk there

195
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,240
so in any case I so in this scenario how
many of us

196
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,810
with the zone thats much the idea

197
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,280
the simulation so this is how I created
the simulation its you can see it's

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,670
fairly simple

199
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,750
I see this is a very simple model so

200
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,980
the important thing with arena are these
these things so these things are called

201
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,790
modulus

202
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,209
and a it's pretty much like a
drag-and-drop will show you is like

203
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,670
what each of these modules are

204
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,860
meant for and what do you do so for
example like this create mon Dieu

205
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,360
like these things that look like this
the actually create the zombies

206
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,740
yeah I mean the people the people
stampeding out the door

207
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,650
so they create the zombies here 170 this
one creates

208
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,280
like the ones on the going in the door
this is another important

209
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,230
module which is called the process
module and the process module

210
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,020
is actually like a representation of the
action

211
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,220
so here all I really did places like
there's only one action

212
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,450
that we will do its like a stampede
outside or so

213
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,240
that's pretty much it so that's why i
wanna the process module that we're

214
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,350
using

215
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,820
here the more more important stuff in a
simulation

216
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,150
is actually that this site more Joe this
gives you

217
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,310
logic rules as I mentioned little while
ago

218
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,930
so I made it very simple sold out the
thing here's like if you are stampeding

219
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,739
what are the chances you get I you
encounter a zombie

220
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,370
so if you don't encounter a zombie that
you the entity

221
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,050
actually leaves the simulation so it's
gone

222
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,770
but you if you do encounter a zombie

223
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,390
the next question are you zombie fighter
even

224
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,600
if you were reading then you leave the
simulation

225
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,500
but if you get some defied actually
become a zombie

226
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,290
and increases the chances that other
people would

227
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,980
encountering you some pics so that's
pretty much how you do like

228
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,130
simulations it's very just a like
creating flowcharts

229
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,590
so this one is the record module aside
said like every night has like a

230
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,540
really cool like statistics and
reporting so this is what the report

231
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,329
looks like in this is a required module

232
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,570
like if you wanted to want to learn more
just fine me likely

233
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,840
during the break and stop and we can
likely around

234
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,880
so this this actually what arena looks
like

235
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,070
okay so this arena so

236
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,220
you see it's it looks very much like
this you're right

237
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,580
so these on the on this site are
actually the process modules

238
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,130
so it's just drag-and-drop it's really
that simple and once you define your

239
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,390
you're different Mon different modules
your different

240
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,740
a logic rules here there

241
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,500
all you really need to do is like hide
them together

242
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,620
in run so think of it as a visual

243
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,740
that you can actually run in stop so

244
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,500
so it's a pretty cool actually so like
here we have our

245
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,900
ours on the simulation all you need to
do is like to run the simulation is

246
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,680
actually like Chris

247
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,319
Press ago and it'll run 0 superfast

248
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,140
was fast so so this so let's do it in
slow motion so

249
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,260
you see here it's going like through the
different like the different

250
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,310
like logic rules and all that stuff so

251
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,890
so it's cool to see it and I see there's
a lot more prettier

252
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,340
IOC creepier simulations here because
you're

253
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,630
it Irene actually has a visual designer
where you can like create

254
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,120
very very fancy stuff so but the thing
here to

255
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,360
real value of a simulation is not
running at once

256
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,470
the real value of a simulation is
running it

257
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,370
hundreds and maybe thousands of times
right so we

258
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,520
you know the best scenario and the worst
scenario so that's why you run it like

259
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,900
multiple times

260
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,500
so it's very easy here so you said set
it up here you just put like

261
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,420
that's a that's run a hundred
simulations and that's run it like now

262
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,790
it's in slow motion

263
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,900
but let's put it like a batch run so I'm
going to run

264
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,480
100 simulations here start easy

265
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,500
that's a hundred simulations already so
you see the report

266
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,110
so finally see the report here

267
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,580
on average maybe a hundred sixty two of
us would actually get out

268
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,070
on average I but on like a

269
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,450
relatively slow day let's say you guys
just had

270
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,770
much really like sleepy not looking at
this stop

271
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,140
150 one of us could be like zombified
are you

272
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:55,900
but you know if you're all other at
those monster drinks there

273
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,650
169 but actually get out except

274
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,140
the speaker here which is like that one
there any

275
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,230
so anyway so that was a makeup a quick
example if a simulation AC

276
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,039
it's really very simple II love to give
you like the samples here

277
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:20,039
and you can run it on your own so the
next one

278
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,609
okay so that's the zombie simulations
for my last one

279
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,149
I'm just going to show you something a
little bit more practice but a little

280
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,250
bit more simple

281
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,820
I think you can actually start with this
particular simulation

282
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,000
if you're playing around with it ok wait
I forgot slide

283
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,210
so well that's on the thing was a little
bit unrealistic right

284
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,429
so I but the thing here yes think about
this

285
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,799
tweak Italian tweet that tweak it a
little and you can turn this on base

286
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,340
think of it as malware sites the people
who are stampeding

287
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,570
think ovett as user surfing the internet

288
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,080
think that this on the application
process a smaller infection

289
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,980
you can pretty much related to
information security already right

290
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,260
so this zombie simulation that was the
point is on the simulation that's really

291
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,940
way

292
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,860
I that so questions in this edition so
how much infections are we expecting

293
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,399
Lake how many infections could be
getting that day a year

294
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,309
week or something on then how much time
do we need to fix this how much

295
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:26,850
personnel maybe I should

296
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,179
it's a formal our protection so I love
these

297
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,570
good like this pride simulation can help
you actually make decisions

298
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,889
so going now back to that

299
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,920
to the final like a a simulation that I
was going to show you something or

300
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,470
simply

301
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,940
it's really simple this one you can
actually do it yourself

302
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,050
so this one we're going to talk about
the billion dollar lost laptop problem

303
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:54,340
the important thing with simulations
actually set aside from the scenario in

304
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,620
the question

305
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,090
is the model so you have to create a
good model

306
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,840
so using that so honestly I don't
actually

307
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,290
agree with the light up to stuff that

308
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,159
that paper said but for now for the
purposes of the

309
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,980
this example let's use that so for that
model they were saying that two point

310
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,650
there you

311
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,050
up tops our loss per year but 4.5
percent love

312
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,950
recovered an issue they say that that 30
percent off a laptop to actually

313
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,180
scripted then they said that the cost of
a laptop is actually about 56

314
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,980
pic the six thousand dollars like

315
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,750
so if we run this customization any if
you run the simulation using just

316
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,620
like maybe a thousand laptops watch I
have one run it I of you

317
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,209
a a show you the results so you see a 30
per cell

318
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,020
here's the model by the way as you see
it's very very simple much simpler

319
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,470
and is on the simulation so with this

320
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,040
can see it's like a 30 percent increase
you could actually cost you about

321
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,020
162 1.5 million lot that's why they call
it a billion-dollar laptop problem

322
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,570
so if you like tweak it and with
simulations you can actually tweaky

323
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,530
you can make changes to let fifty
percent see it's going down not but not

324
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,410
by much

325
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,880
and at 75 per cent per cent encryption
the laptop

326
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,700
you get like a you finally get like a
probability o0i three-set that this

327
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,660
best and but it still alive it's still a
lot but the thing here

328
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,640
is that particular simulation that I
show you is well

329
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,830
unrealistic again so you have to put it
in context with doing like simulations

330
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,970
because I not 0

331
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,260
because for for one not all laptops
would have sensitive information right

332
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,500
and take into consideration the
population

333
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,620
so doctors will probably have a higher
chance of getting pH II

334
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,639
so in the for simulation what we did was
we assume that every laptop

335
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,960
will cost us fifty six thousand dollars
so in this case

336
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,860
we have the same auto what we do like a
little bit more calm

337
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,090
customization for example we asked like
that are HR department hey how many

338
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:04,610
doctors

339
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,790
we have how many like I people up

340
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,220
probably like handle sensitive
information like nurses doing

341
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,330
were and like a either each our
personnel

342
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,260
I love that kind of stuff so that's the
value of doing it like some

343
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,650
customization here

344
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,660
so I the rest have no sensitive want

345
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,620
so here's you you can see we kinda
changed a little bit

346
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,080
the simulation right so we had the
original one but I created a branch here

347
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,770
that

348
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,210
deals with like doctors and like

349
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,429
people hand pH II I love that kind of
stuff so if we run

350
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:42,970
the simulation you actually get much
lower

351
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,720
a range so I 30 percent you already have
like a

352
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,940
pretty good probably like a best case
probably that

353
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,929
it will really cost you but it still
costing you 50

354
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:57,540
75 so it's a little bit lower much lower

355
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,220
so that's why this is the value of doing
a simulation with a

356
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,650
customization but now you're thinking
probably you're probably thinking they

357
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,600
pay so iffy were doing that so why not
just

358
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,149
cripple the doctors right so here

359
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,040
we doing cripple the doctors let's
Justin people encrypt other doctors

360
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,290
richard 20 percent

361
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,409
of the population so if you do that so
here's the simulation I just I did like

362
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:23,970
a

363
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,630
another logic here separating obverse

364
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,360
and you get here the lowest rate so

365
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,389
this just like a twenty-percent FBI

366
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,530
encryption of the population after they
get the lowest

367
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,940
value here 023 so but now you think
about it right

368
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,960
the results are pretty obvious pretty
obvious but the thing here

369
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,530
gives you quantifiable elements to basis
support your decisions

370
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,320
and he is tailored to your environment
which use pretty good you it's not just

371
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,928
a

372
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:58,990
say to your boss like a on average I

373
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,610
laptop loss would probably cost a 6.4 mi
yes so it's

374
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,169
this is much better so things to
remember and wrapping up now the

375
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,120
simulation stuff simulations

376
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,669
can help you find well the best
solutions for a problem

377
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,090
then the most appropriate see our
environment and you

378
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,280
have led quantity: basis for your
decisions but the thing with simulations

379
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,110
here before you do anything just think
about these questions first

380
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,379
iris also already known to some of the
people in the trenches

381
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,670
sometimes it is some thanks the results
are pretty obvious but sometimes it's

382
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,500
not

383
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,690
and sometimes with when it gets you like
an unexpected result

384
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,540
are you willing to do that change are
you willing to implement that change

385
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,120
based on a simulation

386
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,370
and another thing accuracy depends on
the model as you can see like in my

387
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,939
simulations is going to the

388
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,050
like millions and hundreds of thousands
but that is because I based it off a

389
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,690
model liking the paper

390
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,730
upon my paper so that those are the
things that you have to think about

391
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,090
with simulations and you can do friend
pasti things with simulations not

392
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,189
only the things that I show you which
looks like flow charts

393
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,640
you can actually do I skip their slide

394
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,800
let me just a go back like a some other
use cases and scenarios

395
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,178
simulations for one I've already seen
like some study said they're actually

396
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:20,850
doing

397
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,820
like assimilating hacker activity so
they're simulating like a

398
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,159
like a reconnaissance RC simulating a
duration

399
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,610
vulnerability scanning and exploitation
seem like free legal papers about that

400
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,219
one

401
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,809
then they're also doing like a
simulations have network attack so what

402
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,840
they're doing there is actually getting
like smart attacks

403
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,370
in running it like funneling those smart
attacks

404
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,870
based on live smart box and funneling it

405
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,219
into like simulations large networks so
it seemed like a

406
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,290
where it's getting caught in all of that
kind of stuff so aside from this there's

407
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,760
a lot more like fire somewhere
propagation you

408
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,030
seen that liked it's very similar is on
the simulation

409
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,480
and I would love to top the guys about
other interesting simulations that you

410
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,380
can think of so I'll be

411
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,260
actually outside and if you guys want to
talk about it if you want to learn

412
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,110
how to do this I'll be there doing like
a makeup

413
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,129
teaching kinda thing so anyway

414
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,910
other stuff that you can do it it's not
only those flow chart kinda thing

415
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,440
because I simulations in arena Irene
actually has like what it's called like

416
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,120
visual designer can actually make it
Esprit PSU what do

417
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,678
an issue see here so the combat
simulation years in

418
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,710
emergency rule simulation this one is

419
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,230
truck assembly and that was actually a
mission to mars

420
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,440
simulation so you can do s like really
pretty ones

421
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,929
so in any case that pretty much ends my

422
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:54,010
simulation and hi a

423
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,260
would like to turn over this
presentation to mister

424
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,190
Bob mcpherson going to talk about big
data

425
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:10,190
thank you Ryan

426
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,350
was good to be back in Waikiki it's been
since 1996 that I was here before

427
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,330
and always enjoyed get a chance come to
why I lead a team of researchers who

428
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:20,899
work with

429
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,860
catastrophe modeling data foreign a
large insurance company

430
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,590
and we run super computing environments
a lot of data

431
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,300
that the simulation models come equipped
ron was showing but were simulating

432
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,950
hurricanes and earthquakes and

433
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,780
terrorism attacks and things like that
kinda fun stuff and some you might be

434
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,520
asking what does that have to do with
security

435
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,740
basically nothing I'll but

436
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,450
I stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last
night so you're sure of

437
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,600
had I no actually up

438
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,340
Ryan and I we met intercourse the
Harvard University last year

439
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,980
and up we bumped into each other at a
pizza party believe it or not

440
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,410
and he got peanut butter my chocolate I
got chocolate as peanut butter

441
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,880
so we thought it tastes pretty good and
and we are trying collaborating little

442
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,250
bit

443
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,770
and seeing what happens when you take
some analytics and you bring it to a

444
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,690
different datasets

445
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,060
I just love analytics have all kinds
live export analytics well beyond

446
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,030
insurance allotted

447
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,160
fields it's always fun to get some new
data and and try to explore that see

448
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,430
which

449
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,600
find out what some very solid rhythms
and analytical techniques

450
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,689
so I really really rely on Ryan's
expertise and other experts

451
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,200
to ask the right kinds of questions and
that sort of thing my hope is that when

452
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,880
you see somebody examples I'll give

453
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,770
that some you that maybe already have
some expertise in analytics will be

454
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,770
saying gee you know

455
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,590
I could take some other questions could
be asked maybe in some better questions

456
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,980
and some other ways to attack it other
you others have you will be looking at

457
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,110
the code thinking

458
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,510
you have a code allergy follows you to
remember the

459
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,960
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercial
adjustment measure with peanut butter

460
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,630
and

461
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,770
chocolate you're really dating yourself
chuckle about on

462
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,970
the younger ones %uh view that was a
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercial

463
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,650
probably don't know what you're talking
about their I'll

464
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:06,890
so why would you do this well you could
do server log forensics I'm gonna show

465
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,680
that as an example but of course you
can't analyze what

466
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,120
lots of different kinds of data beyond
server logs and simply gonna show that

467
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,500
as an example here because

468
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,400
a little bit easier to grasp over the
user to demonstrate but you could do

469
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,500
streaming data you could also do some
text mining analysis on web sites and

470
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,420
that sort of thing

471
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,370
a lot that you can do with this also
you'll notice that I broken just about

472
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,850
every ruling giving presentations were
putting way too much information every

473
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,419
slide

474
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,610
but that's because I want to know
something you can take home with you

475
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,800
been to a lot accomplished as myself or
you know I will always appreciate it

476
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,180
when I had a presentation I could take
on later

477
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,970
and study it and a little more def and
give me some code that I could work with

478
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,040
us while occasionally

479
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,970
or gonna show here's is some big data
technology Hadoop and MapReduce

480
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,560
how many of your for do Chopin's okay

481
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,000
private happier for for a number you and
a MapReduce kinda goes hand in hand with

482
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,420
to do

483
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,930
and I'm going to use something called
high if technology the right on top of

484
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,410
that enables you to query

485
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,300
data textual data thats distributed
across many different computers that's

486
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,909
what how do people do for explain a
little more about that later

487
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,800
ever going to someplace he searches for
keywords in terms of it isn't I

488
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,909
time aggregations of what blog variables
perform sorting to identify potential

489
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,550
problems forces were also going to
create some analytical data sets a combi

490
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,990
exported and you can use other
analytical tools on it so if you've got

491
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,380
many servers they obviously create a lot
of logs

492
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,000
and it can be very very difficult to
deal with

493
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,090
up Asus an area we have a lot of blogs
and need to analyze it wants to do them

494
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,080
one by one takes way too much time

495
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,290
and maybe even even be impossible so
what you can do with Hadoop

496
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,840
in that environment as you can actually
analyze them all at once as if they were

497
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,760
in one table

498
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,570
gotta look to you like they're all in
one table but in fact you got many

499
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,909
different server log secure

500
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,220
analyzing simultaneously and the setup
that I've got here is

501
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,280
your got the log files and I'm going to
use an Amazon

502
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,510
cloud environment how many have you
heard of Emma songs

503
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,720
ec2 environment lhasa cloud computing
okay

504
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,860
less a few some love you have and you
could have also done this on your own

505
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,500
environment you can set up custom and
I've done that

506
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,240
as well but the reason I'm showing it
was on it because every one of you has

507
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,400
access to that

508
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,720
they have a free trial after which a

509
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,250
there is a nominal charge could be a big
charge depending on how many

510
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,350
virtual computers you spin up but I've
been doing it for some time on my own I

511
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,110
haven't had a big bill yet what I
consider to be a big deal

512
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,050
so it's kinda convenient way to
essentially have super super computing

513
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,399
capability at your fingertips

514
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,160
and hives lets you write SQL like syntax
queries on Hadoop

515
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,500
how many of you no SQL

516
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,750
okay by about thirty you know SQL a

517
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,920
how many of you know somebody that knows
SQL

518
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,929
okay most of you know somebody at least
the nose SQL so if you don't know it

519
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:03,830
you can turn this over to someone in
your staff for so many an organization

520
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,310
that can

521
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,490
they can work with it socially have
taken these log files

522
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,130
and I've moved them to an Amazon s3
bucket which is just storage

523
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:17,320
simple storage and from there I push it
intuitive distributed file system

524
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,090
and then I run hive queries on that file
system so it's essentially flow

525
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,100
let's go going going to happen here

526
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,168
now the server logs can be downloaded
from this location so when you go home

527
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:30,700
if you want to give this a shot

528
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,679
the date is all out there you can
download it from their output put them

529
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,530
all there

530
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:38,720
and the HQ all code which is what hive
calls its query language it's really

531
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:38,980
just

532
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,820
SQL with a few extra capabilities and
features thrown at but if you know

533
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,659
sequel

534
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,200
you do HQL that code also taught at this
website

535
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,240
and then I'm also gonna use a little bit
of are are as a statistical programming

536
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,360
languages

537
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,020
ours known as a lingua franca of
statistics these days

538
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,600
so I got some code out their sample that
you can work with

539
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,060
the software that you need to run the
analysis is all out there and

540
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:08,250
you see two Amazon and is a really nice
tutorial here

541
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,550
and I've got some weblinks to get to it
I'll just show you what that looks like

542
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:18,350
it's pretty easy to follow

543
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,159
there you go and it's got screenshots
and that kinda thing to get you started

544
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,310
now I won't say it's something you could
do in 15 minutes it is going to take a

545
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,590
little time to learn this

546
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,530
it's not really nice early trivial
effort but it certainly doable for

547
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,340
everybody in here

548
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,820
just wanted to vote couple hours to it
can learn how to

549
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,740
navigate that environment and become
operational

550
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:46,740
well worth the investment in time though
I'd say

551
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,639
also there's a link here if you want to
set up your own environment you don't

552
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,890
want to do an Amazon

553
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,030
you can use something called cloud era
this also open source and you can

554
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,510
download it for free to trial

555
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,840
I've got a linker are and also
technology called him out

556
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,629
looks like me out they pronounce mild
and that'll be able to do analytics and

557
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,940
Hadoop MapReduce environment

558
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,960
so for those of you that don't know ask
you well and is going to do a real quick

559
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,169
high-level

560
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:16,000
introduction as to what it does it
stands for Structured Query Language

561
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,610
essentially it follows the same
structure every time gonna create tables

562
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,020
falls a set structure

563
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,100
a common queries follows a structure
here where you have a select

564
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,668
a column names you list the names in it
from the list the table or tables

565
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:34,190
where where simply a filter and you just
name your category as your filter by

566
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,720
your roles and you can group by the
categories you can also order them

567
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,220
categories you know that

568
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,750
do other things like joins and what so
it may look like Greek today but if you

569
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,030
spend a little bit a time to learn is
probably the easiest language to learn

570
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,520
any that I can think up so it's worth a
little bit I've effort and investment to

571
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,700
learn this

572
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,700
hive uses Java code to make text files
look like tables in a relational

573
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,360
database

574
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,909
and it's known as no sequel it doesn't
look at literally meaning no sequel you

575
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,620
can I was your rights equal against it

576
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,270
something like high what it means is not
only sequel so the no sequels a bit of a

577
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,590
misnomer

578
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,399
and here's the software stack already
use you have a hoodoo file system that

579
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,859
takes the server logs

580
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:21,049
and it spreads it out if you can imagine
having and

581
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,000
Microsoft file a

582
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,210
your followers and what not you've got
your file explorer and Microsoft

583
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,050
well imagine your server logs being
spread out in a file structure there but

584
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,159
not just on your

585
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,010
desktop spread out across many desktops
are many servers

586
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,129
that's kinda what it's doing here it's
this decentralizing and spreading it out

587
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:41,879
so you have

588
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,339
many many machines the power many
machines working for you to do the

589
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:46,399
crunching here

590
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,870
so once you have the server logs spread
out that way in a new file system you

591
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,899
need something to build

592
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:54,540
aggregated do the analysis and that's
for MapReduce comes and that's a

593
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,220
technology that enables you to do that

594
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,500
and then you where you could write job
because MapReduce is based on a Java

595
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,440
platform for

596
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,540
so for those view their Java programmers
just curious on this show a hands on you

597
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,810
ever program programmed anything in Java
up

598
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,940
if you have okay so you could program
and and

599
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,800
Java you would like and you can really
customize things that way

600
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,990
but I'm showing you hi on topic %uh job
on MapReduce what that does is it

601
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,000
translates your queries

602
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,220
in a way that can be run in MapReduce
and makes it easier and

603
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,060
SQL is a much more commonly known
language much easier work with a few

604
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,740
just got explore the data

605
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,819
so or just to give an example here

606
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,180
here to set up your environment hear
your commands

607
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,910
is set up for stay up up

608
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:47,500
your distributed file system and then
you move your data from your

609
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,810
s3 pockets and you start hive simple
baked copy are

610
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:55,040
typing and high and you have to add a
Java archive file its

611
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,870
jar known as a JAR file and I'm setting
here too

612
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,480
show the headers as true so anytime I
get out but it's gonna show the headers

613
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,339
recalls

614
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:06,120
so you you're obviously not gonna
memorize that but it's therefore if you

615
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,390
wanna go and you want to copy those his
pace to write command line and hive and

616
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,490
you can run with it get started

617
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,879
the log files were gonna analyzer and
combine format but there are many kinds

618
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,060
of formats

619
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:21,240
that your log files could take the shape
up so you can customize this any way

620
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,879
that you may need to

621
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,000
ever get you something called regular
expressions to parse

622
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,160
the log files and regular expressions
for those of you that don't know it's

623
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,500
just sort of many programming language
that will parse text

624
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,380
and I'm not sure why they call regular
it doesn't look very regular when you

625
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,960
look at it but they're called regular
expressions

626
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,530
and here's a CREATE TABLE statement that
you can simply copy this to pace to

627
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,560
write the hive command prompt

628
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,830
and it will create the table for you and
here you see those funny squiggly things

629
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,089
down for the bottom

630
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:56,310
those a regular expressions his
character's down here

631
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,900
believe or not that's actually giving
instructions as to how to parse

632
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,430
each have the fields in your log file

633
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,839
in telling it what columns to put it so
all that's there for your combined

634
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:08,799
format

635
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,060
and I'm using apaches example logs

636
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,259
a not apaches I'm sorry Amazon's

637
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,400
fire logs they have some that you can
actually sample

638
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,290
and Theron common format I'll

639
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:26,620
I added to it though I put some I put
some attacks and there are some examples

640
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,400
love put a seventh file in there that
shows

641
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,250
vulnerable so vulnerabilities that were
exploited and their actual attack so

642
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:34,960
that we can actually

643
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,339
taxable those we actually love this

644
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:42,100
here's the hive command prompt looks
like hi the khmer prop

645
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,009
load 8 a.m. path edges pace the same
here it's gonna take

646
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,280
transfer all of those log files that
were in my storage

647
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,720
s3 storage and moving across that
happens very quickly

648
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,919
the first part of this for a minute show
is the known unknowns

649
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,980
all I'm going to do here is to some
direct sequel queries

650
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,859
on the log files and we look for some
specific situations

651
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:07,319
so we don't know if there are any

652
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,560
any intrusions in here into our log file
but we know what we're looking for we

653
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,430
know what those attacked backers are

654
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,240
so it's probably the simple situations
so I'm gonna show that first

655
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,500
but they're also unknown unknowns and
I'll get to those later we actually

656
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,050
doing it else is your moment to start
with the unknown unknowns first

657
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,580
just to see where you might want to
start your search and then go to your

658
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,500
non sono become a more clear

659
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,800
I think it's like go on here there's an
operator and see for SQL called like

660
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,060
and you can just look for patterns using
like

661
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,370
it's a simple way to do it if you prefer
using regular expressions I'm sure some

662
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,210
love you are capable of doing that

663
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,520
you can also use regular expressions to
really hone in on what you want to do

664
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,900
but the like operators or user to show
what we're doing here

665
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,980
Thursday example I'm gonna select all
columns out with the asterisk means

666
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,950
from the table apache log in that's what
I call it when I created it

667
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,220
and I'm going to lower case so where you
see lower that simply a function that

668
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,270
produces everything to lower case
earnings consistent

669
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:10,190
where it's like any whatever you see any
of these kinds of scenarios

670
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,870
so you got da di XE obviously that
somebody was probably running around for

671
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,330
you txt file

672
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,440
possibly doing an inclusion XE file

673
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,500
on .in eyes another one execute a ball

674
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,300
I you've also got a lot of files here
that are at the root

675
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,589
up any kind of a Linex kinda been
operating system that I'm sure many of

676
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:30,120
you recognize USR

677
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,520
UTC TV op rooted cetera

678
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,030
so if you find any those then bringing
back and show us

679
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,290
also the very last one here so the Swiss
Army Knife attraverso

680
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,759
dot dot at very bottom whenever you have
dot dot slash those

681
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,270
you know a little new UNIX know that you
can pump up to the next

682
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:51,230
former above for the next directory
using that dot dot

683
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,300
and you see that a lot with these kinds
a attacks

684
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,150
here's the result when you when you run
that query right through hive command

685
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,890
prop

686
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,950
there are in fact we're these were
actual attacks some

687
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,700
is this is a came back and you see the
ubiquitous dot dot dash dot dot slash

688
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,569
but you also look at the status code
here as 404

689
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,940
okay that was a that fail that's a
that's a

690
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,130
status code that the relief it was a
request the failed

691
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,200
500 series be another one to fail until
you get down here at the bottom one

692
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,080
that's a 2-under

693
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,640
down there that would succeed that would
actually got through lines are just

694
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,490
trial and error

695
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,009
until they actually managed to get
through see just

696
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,600
do this from any direction for anything
you want to see advantage of doing these

697
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,850
custom queries and yeah

698
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:38,220
case a lot a code takes a little bit
effort but again

699
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,640
up this will do whatever you dream up
you're not going to get that with any

700
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,410
kind about doing your fancy kinda

701
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,009
an application there's command
injections

702
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:51,640
what this will do is try to disguise
commands with HTML you are all in coding

703
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,670
this query is a very simple one but
includes keywords from some common

704
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,990
examples like

705
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,129
a a purse and comma or 28 percent twenty
ako

706
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,490
percent sixty ID and you can you can
really add to this list or a lot about

707
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,870
the possibilities that you could do

708
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:10,910
just using these few produced movies
here visa

709
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,830
these problems that came through were
the rack for breaches here

710
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,250
and you if you look for you can actually
see that there are examples

711
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,330
up the ampersand calm and some of those
key

712
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:24,799
terms if we look for earlier so those
are the known

713
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,760
a examples I've known unknowns and I
actually have a lot of are

714
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,700
done a lot more not got a few more
examples in the sample code to be able

715
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,990
to download if you wanna take a look at
that

716
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,669
but that's all I'm gonna show this point
just to get the idea what I mean by sort

717
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,220
of reform queer free-form search

718
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,439
now let's go to the unknown unknowns
this is a little trickier this is where

719
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,109
you get into some

720
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:48,000
zero-day stuff and that sort of thing
here you gonna be looking for out wires

721
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,710
are gonna need

722
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,830
you some statistics on this one so a
real as a probably just went from bad to

723
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,430
worse you just want from code

724
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,910
they're going to statistics but for
those if you enjoy that kind of thing I

725
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,640
can see there something you do

726
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,310
just by show of hands a you probably
enjoy doing some other stuff invaded and

727
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,650
maybe some you do already

728
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:09,180
by the way if you do feel free to send
me know if you have ideas or whatever

729
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm always loving to collaborate and
learn from others so semi semi whatever

730
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,630
you've got

731
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:17,740
it's fun stuff arm let's move on here

732
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:22,270
here we talk about we're gonna kinda
take this analysis on the status codes a

733
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,620
102 are three other serious range

734
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,620
all have one thing in common and that's
basically

735
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,319
that it was a success is some kinda
rough comments ago weather but

736
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,460
basically those were successful requests
to the server

737
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,870
but if you get in the 400 range in the
five arrange those were unsuccessful

738
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,799
attempts

739
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,820
the five yr range really need to watch
out for because those

740
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,450
are the ones that were the server itself
there is a failure on the server side

741
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:50,259
a series of failed request: could be an
indication of what attacker using trial

742
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,950
and error until they attack succeeds

743
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,310
so what if you could look for some
patterns about where they're actually

744
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,470
doing some trial and error

745
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,020
you know what attack vector their doing
you don't know what career is to run

746
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,290
necessarily don't know

747
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,330
how they're coming in on it which wanna
see if they may be doing some trial and

748
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:04,920
error

749
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,190
followed by some successes so we're
gonna try out some some

750
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,540
methods of doing

751
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:16,540
persuaded group it by those types 100
two or three hours here is a success

752
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,710
gonna code those as 0 those your
successes

753
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,470
and the four or five arteries write a
code is a1 so that you can actually run

754
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,629
some statistics and predict whether you
going to get is here or going to get a

755
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,400
water that kind of thing

756
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,150
so we have a case statement here and I'm
using a substring function

757
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,960
so high for those be the no sequel
you're used to the substring typable

758
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,540
approach for function you can also do
that with high

759
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,859
pretty directly as you can see here

760
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:47,520
and I can also do time aggregations so I
can take that date stamp

761
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,859
in the log file and I can actually
aggregate by time

762
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:55,589
using sequel careers or HQ or queries

763
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:59,540
and I could parse it most BRT no I think
what a timestamp looks like

764
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,520
but here I've got a third bullet example
you've got 20th July 2009

765
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,930
that I've got the time and you can't
parse it down to the second

766
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,720
if you want to if you want to look at
what happens throughout a particular day

767
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,980
in this case I'm just gonna parse it
down to the month from the day

768
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,970
in the year sewing at a time series

769
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,649
here's an example the query now in my
code looks like prettier than this

770
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,600
but this is about the only way I could
cram it into a slide you can actually

771
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,759
copy this from here

772
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,180
run it a and the result of this query is
down at the bottom right got month

773
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,700
and year now it doesn't quite lineup
when you when you get the output from

774
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,419
the seven which is a month doesn't quite
lineup for the column header months as

775
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,250
you can see but you can't figure it out
this just help rinse out

776
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,680
the years 2009 and then the combination
month day is

777
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,730
07 20 so it's July 28th

778
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,030
and your mother's 2009 07 now I added
some views to that too

779
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,290
to further get my day here and I'm gonna

780
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:00,220
also I'm gonna create some views that
just look for failed requests

781
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:05,259
so in this case arm I'm gonna do it
daily time series and look for trends

782
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,580
sequences and ultimately I'm gonna get
from running a query below I'm gonna get

783
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,630
something that looks like

784
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:16,400
this up here where it says 2009 07 20

785
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,010
and I'm also gonna do two different
views no views like creating a table

786
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,450
really what happens your code is stored
rescue of course

787
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,839
code is stored when you run a few its
gonna run that query again life

788
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:32,620
and that's what I've done here creed two
views one works for successful

789
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,130
attempts another look set failed
attempts at if I take a ratio between

790
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,160
the two

791
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,420
I'm gonna get a daily ratio love failed
to successful

792
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,660
taps overtime so what to look for spikes
where Apple what

793
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,960
love failed requests followed by
successes and see if I can

794
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,299
do some out liar detection on anyway
when I run these views like it's

795
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:57,210
something that looks like a bottle at

796
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,750
at the bottom here where you've got a
call missus year month day 2009 July 7

797
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,810
20

798
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:08,339
and then you get a feel ratio there on
the right

799
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,700
and I can export that data for further
analysis

800
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,589
and I just run this here this or to
request it says insert overwrite local

801
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:18,600
directory and I put a name there as to
what I want to call it

802
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,670
it's gonna create for by this name
failed request by

803
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,260
day it's gonna dump the date in there
from there you can pull into data

804
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,990
visualization tools

805
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,500
like tableau or you can run are into
your own

806
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,230
ho home-grown visualizations if you will
that's kinda wanna show here

807
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,569
and hear some arco I'm not gonna teach
you all be or programmers

808
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:46,569
but the codes here you can run it if if
you want to try this at home

809
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:50,859
so what I'm gonna do now as I'm gonna
create

810
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:54,040
a plot that shows out weir's and

811
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,549
this is across time you see day in the
bottom in the x-axis

812
00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:01,580
and the y-axis is the ratio failed
request a successful request

813
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,380
if review that have ever had Six Sigma
training or anything like that

814
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,299
how many fear for her up Six Sigma yes
it's an Operations Research term

815
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:14,930
and you're probably familiar with upper
control limit lower control in a concept

816
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,040
well it's a simple way that you can do
that are will do that pretty readily and

817
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,440
I just

818
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,990
the dotted line at the very top there is
two standard deviations

819
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,620
from the me and a standard deviation the
easiest way I know how to describe that

820
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,750
as a sexually

821
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,970
what is your average deviation from the
mean

822
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,319
so what is your average difference from
the average

823
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:37,250
essentially is laws all that is and so
if

824
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:40,990
if you look at the day's were year while
Apollo

825
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:44,430
two times the average difference from
the average

826
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,799
you've got three incidents here look
rather aw

827
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:51,299
and I think this is kinda interesting
because this was mostly Amazon server

828
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:53,020
logs I didn't put enough

829
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,450
a air situations in her or penetration
situations in here to really have spiked

830
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,600
it that much

831
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,089
so it looks to me like somebody probably
was making some attempts

832
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:06,440
against Amazon's logs and up

833
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,230
was not successful but nevertheless they
made it up and if you find a situation

834
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,190
like this

835
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:15,250
might bear walking into those particular
days and drilling down

836
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,710
if you saw in the previous example here
I actually

837
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,049
this fail ratio you can't go down
through and you can find those

838
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,380
particular days you can actually do a
max

839
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,980
function so you look for the max on days
and you can find that they're pretty

840
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,640
readily

841
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,740
you drill down into those also was
looking for seasonality cuz anytime

842
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,540
you're dealing with the time series need
to know sorry seasonality the kinda

843
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,450
screwed that up

844
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,299
your findings in this case are an
autocorrelation function

845
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:45,620
and basically there's no evidence here
any significant seasonality that I

846
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,089
should be concerned about but if

847
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:51,130
if there was you can adjust their
seasonality in this case that Pauline

848
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,819
the co the first line at the left goes
up by love

849
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:57,859
the dotted line that just is that the
zero point so that's telling me that the

850
00:48:57,859 --> 00:48:58,370
coral

851
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:01,680
at the time series is not correlated to
itself hence the term

852
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,990
autocorrelation and appeared seasonality
it would be correlated to itself at some

853
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,240
point in here

854
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,169
and so I'm not seeing any evidence that
but our will do all those kinds of

855
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,180
things and much much more

856
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,350
and I can also produce additional
analytical data sets and I'm gonna group

857
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:17,799
this one a little bit differently

858
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:21,450
I'm going to you something call me out
which enables you to do

859
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,700
analytics on Hadoop MapReduce without
pulling

860
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,870
data into something like arc is ours
limited are has limited memory

861
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:32,560
it will use a lot of memory in your
system actually so

862
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,700
you know you have to aggregate your data
up to a smaller dataset if you're

863
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,620
aggregating it

864
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,870
into a time series well that does shrink
your data size quite a bit surreal pull

865
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:41,279
that out

866
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,390
analyze it is I just even though the
amount of data

867
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:48,330
in the server log files was way too big
just pulled directly into our

868
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,330
environment without aggravating

869
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:54,310
by time in this case these are command
line

870
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:58,400
a commit up command lines but you can
put into

871
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,420
the mouth environment and it'll run a
MapReduce job for you

872
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,680
and I'll do something called a logistic
regression and

873
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,210
all it does is it predicts well you're
going to have a one or a0 remember one

874
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,880
from that ruler query that I did means
that you had some kind of a penetration

875
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,540
some kind of a problem there

876
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,020
0 means it was okay so we're just going
to predict that

877
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,500
and all we're going to use as a
predictor in this case I didn't make a

878
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,790
fancy I just want to do by host

879
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,230
are there any hosts in other words that
are associated with

880
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,109
failed requests our host to tend to be
associated with successful requests

881
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:34,480
and that's all this is doing here I'm so
I ran to

882
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,480
and I disguise summer the IP address is
here because it was actually data

883
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,660
saga X is there at the beginning but
this is how you would set up a problem

884
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,850
and in the end what you get this is a
coefficient for each for those hosts and

885
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:52,359
and the sizeof that number tells you how
related

886
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:56,850
it is to you feel request or successful
question on the left hand side the way I

887
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,580
set this of this problem

888
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,359
the negative numbers are success
requires so all the hosts on the left

889
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,220
hand side

890
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,240
tend to be more so she ate it was
successful requests

891
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,370
but I sorted out by the coefficient and
so you see that most

892
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:15,540
hoss actually do have success requires
as we expect but I'd be more concerned

893
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,410
with the ones over here on the right and
I don't see any huge spikes because

894
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,190
again we're using

895
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,790
Amazon's data I would hope there would
be a huge spike serve in a few

896
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,410
if you had a very vulnerable situation I
would expect to see a much bigger spike

897
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:31,230
you're on the right hand side were there
certain IP is

898
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:35,140
their associated tend to be associated
with failed requests and those might

899
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:39,359
bear some further investigation

900
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,299
in other words a 10m or failed requests
and they have success a request so

901
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:47,160
up there could be interesting to drill
down into I'm gonna do some time series

902
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:47,460
in a

903
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,790
analysis a Corp Roscoe relations

904
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:53,960
in here I'm gonna be exporting this
series stated

905
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,630
from hive to be imported into are again
and I'm gonna run correlations with

906
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,780
different lacks to search for possible
leading or lagging effects between the

907
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,530
status codes

908
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:06,250
and hear what I'm I'm gonna try to look
for his trial in air attacks

909
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,560
so what you might have is a series a
failed

910
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,029
a request followed by successful request
for the managed to get it so they were

911
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,920
trying a lot of different things

912
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,100
fail and then suddenly got a

913
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,490
and so here I am going to create a few
this is all done and high

914
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:27,810
and I'm summing everything up by the
status code

915
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:31,450
and I'm also putting some descriptive
names to each status code

916
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,419
101 switching protocols 102 processing
et cetera

917
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,700
there's another one there's a status
code in here I'm a teapot

918
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,129
been have you ever seen that one okay it
was an April Fool's joke actually that

919
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,680
really is a status code it's an app
Apache for fools joke this is

920
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:52,180
I'm a teapot another one says stay calm
Wonderfalls that's a

921
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,640
dq what more can I say cross-correlation
else's view if you continue to run it

922
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,870
and pulling into are here ivory table
command that actually polls

923
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:04,859
the data exported from the previous
status a art previous code

924
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:09,890
into status frequencies object or
variable I can analyze it

925
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:13,490
and I'm also in a copy the headers from
hive the descriptive headers put those

926
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,490
in ours while

927
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,850
call I'm gonna make those those columns

928
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,250
and here's some more code I'm actually
running some analysis

929
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:26,109
on the result let me show you result
this is a cross-correlation analysis

930
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:30,160
where is a scatter plots you gotta array
of scatter plots on what I'm looking for

931
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,009
is any kind ever

932
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,980
diagonal line looks like it's shaping up
to be pretty good

933
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,049
diagonal for a pattern I means that
there's a relationship between

934
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,319
to these variables and the strongest one
it

935
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,370
happens to be this one here on the
bottom left

936
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:51,359
it's fairly diagonals you can see and
this is the 200 coder okay

937
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:56,960
and if I go across to the right related
to the method not allowed code over here

938
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,380
so here you've got some method not
allowed failures

939
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,080
that Chris strongly correlate to success
is 200 OK

940
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,569
I probably it doesn't prove that there
was a problem here but it's something I

941
00:54:07,569 --> 00:54:11,480
probably want to look at a little bit
more closely

942
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,790
and then here you can look at it
numerically the same thing so here I've

943
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,460
got

944
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,210
200 OK and the core correlation
coefficient is .9

945
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:22,220
for with method not allowed 405

946
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,230
that's pretty strong correlation 1.0
would be a perfect correlation

947
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:32,120
and the only thing I V 1.0 is 200
correlated to itself here that is a 1.0

948
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,529
but of the failed codes method not
allowed

949
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:41,270
this is the strongest one and I wanted
to do a cross-correlation else's to see

950
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:45,160
if there's any lag time so your stuff
does this affect tend to occur the same

951
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,089
day

952
00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:49,380
and are they running these method not
allowed a

953
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,470
codes and then getting in with the
success code on the same day

954
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,959
if they are then that might be an
indication that indeed there is

955
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,250
something going on here somebody's
fishing around fact

956
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,420
you see here in this year on the center
this plot the tallest line here the

957
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,839
significa

958
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,140
and yes indeed it tends to be

959
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,670
that on the same day you're getting
success codes that are

960
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:16,150
they're strongly correlated with the
method not allowed for a 5k

961
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:20,060
a few days later you get this negative
correlation a

962
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:24,009
could be an aberration that one doesn't
look quite as statistically significant

963
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,180
but it would also stand to reason that
if they did manage to go and and they

964
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,279
tried to get back in four days later

965
00:55:30,279 --> 00:55:33,819
that you would see it decrease in the
405 coz they don't need to be trying a

966
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:37,180
lot of things that are good

967
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,470
so in conclusion on trying to two years
show you some examples of what you might

968
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,339
do some code fairly simply

969
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:46,370
fairly quickly to look at this from a
lot of different dimensions

970
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,970
ampal creative minds here I'm sure you
guys can't think of much more

971
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,040
intelligent things to do with it than I
did

972
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,130
especially with your background security
so I encourage you that

973
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:57,830
it's worth the effort as was pointed out
earlier too low

974
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,319
learn a little bit of coding and really
do things that you're not going to be

975
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,470
able to do with any other fancy doing

976
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,509
driven or graphical driven tool

977
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:10,180
so with that that's my challenge to you
and I hope you taken away and if you

978
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,480
find some new things

979
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,160
some you know it let me know thank you
