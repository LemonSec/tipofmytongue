1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,100
yeah I would just talk about the fence
orders after twenty-plus years by an

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,989
offence

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,580
I still like to be out of a slight dip
in testing is consulting around the

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,139
world everything stuff like that

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,489
I wanted to start showing people there
are things we can do to defend

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,660
in the main reason for that is I going
all these organizations I do these tests

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,400
and like where's the fundamentals and
defense so we're gonna cover some other

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,180
things you can do to defend its funny
cuz the committee

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,970
and water things was a like or some
other stuff you're talking about is you

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,359
know

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,110
it's been for a while and is true but
unfortunately it's still not follow

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,860
today

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,129
so when discuss summer that because a
lot of it we all know there's no

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,559
such these purpose care director it was
very your guys are not together and tell

15
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,790
you that oh yeah we got a perfect
security solution

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,579
we don't wanna for for security
solutions we have that were a lot of

17
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,390
jobs on Monday

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,489
so we want to make sure that the hackers
and all that type of stuff

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,949
wanna do is make sure we understand the
fits K

20
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:58,559
nets where to buy some if someone comes
to me a well-known organization

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,890
I was trying to see if any over here I
don't know they might be

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,740
thing talk to me offline data like what
I talk about what wanna tell you is

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,369
they told you a sophisticated Sakuma
tell you do the research

24
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,130
but doesn't matter if the attack was
sophisticated or not the thing is

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,780
why was the data there in the first
place re: I come from a military

26
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,170
government background twenty years ago

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,250
we're talking to concept called
segmentation isolation don't put any

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,720
data anywhere without isolated if you
can isolate it

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,900
encrypt alright so some wheeler twenty
years ago

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,979
so why just recently do we have all
these attacks

31
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:36,659
update a compromise where people have
used encryption stuff like that

32
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,689
about ingress and egress inbound and
outbound

33
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,229
in the hardening concept most of us have
heard a hardening concept

34
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,729
why is that most organizations you go
into don't have hardening guidelines

35
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,840
alright they forget about the fact that
every device

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,970
everything we have almost all of them
today have scripts or something we can

37
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,539
use

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,170
to make it more difficult target so I do
we are going to clients I fell in love

39
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,670
with emulating mean level skill set
below

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,340
that is just an attacker that is not
going to reverse engineering

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,069
those types of things and i wanna show
you what your risk is based on that

42
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,649
right if you do hard meaning you to
hardening guidelines will talk about

43
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,500
someone that

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,349
it's very difficult to compromise you
re: do it all but good job at

45
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,700
the fact that we know there's always
gonna be forgot

46
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,690
right and a memory analysis for way if
you do get compromise some quick things

47
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,520
you can do

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,410
little quick methodology to look at that
North talk about

49
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,799
we love to beat up on the Microsoft and
we love to be about Windows

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,239
the server 2008 and 12 as a really good
security enhancements it

51
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,420
makes it more difficult personally I
think it's because they finally brought

52
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,530
in Marcus in a bit just Sysinternals
vein

53
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,330
but they have some things in there the
makes it more difficult ass a

54
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,220
compromiser

55
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,700
new without book bring your own device
well talked about it already

56
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,220
win saw a lot of good demos yesterday
were software

57
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,819
is not a solution so we're talking about
a hardware-based solutions in there

58
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,720
that are available even on the PC &
laptop side is something I know I might

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,250
not know

60
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,720
they're finally the what I call the
outer box network design and that's

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,690
based on

62
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,349
running a network operation center for
six years given internet access to ships

63
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:15,970
at sea

64
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,810
that had ever in the world tryin to
attack right to wear talk about that

65
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,330
word is eyes is going to start

66
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,099
this is the one that drives me
absolutely crazy it was inevitable

67
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,670
they were just too good I never heard
that before

68
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,540
Packers are just too good to when do we
have the buzzwords

69
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,109
APT I see it everywhere right holiday
advanced persistent threat sophisticated

70
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,830
attackers

71
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,049
so most pick on that big organization
and unfortunately no

72
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,330
they don't like it but it's true EMC
owns a group they

73
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,939
arce we all know Rs a secure ID the
compromise against your ID all those

74
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:53,290
times

75
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,530
things or EMC had somebody put a blog
post out

76
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,659
this said the compromise was inevitable
that's where this comes from

77
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,810
right it was sophisticated advanced
persistent threat and all these other

78
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,569
times it's tough

79
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,869
right okay those Eve done research you
know more about it was spearfishing

80
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,599
a target a specific area send an actual
tax was a PDF

81
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,728
and it says are next year's pay scale

82
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:22,550
to light that have refused to open up
everybody there 10 we're gonna get pay

83
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,259
day the problem was in this what I
posted what I rebutted this blog post I

84
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,419
posted the fact that

85
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:31,880
I don't care if it was a sophisticated
attack

86
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,139
let's talk about what it was secure ID
what is that this their number one

87
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:38,430
market leader that they have to

88
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,830
earned their revenue number what number
two

89
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,940
the source code for that should ever be
on a public network

90
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,850
and they think it should be a public
network said I go put it in the clout

91
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,970
several put in the cloud is leave it
there right

92
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,070
that's number two number three what is
Rs

93
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,719
a stand for refreshing mayor Adam into
three guys from iraqi well no no public

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,430
key cryptography all that other stuff

95
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,770
wait a minute now it's not a public
network its source code

96
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,650
and the prime function with these guys
are as a

97
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,719
is encryption if the date is that
encryption

98
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,000
it would tell me why the date is not a
cryptid that trust her own Christian

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,560
right and that's what I put in my
rebuttal to that

100
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,250
because it was it it's a myth that all
of these are sophisticated attacks

101
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,070
in fact Kyle talked about yesterday the
data breach report for Verizon

102
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,419
the 2011 versus the 2012 arrest numbers
on that

103
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:42,380
right 96 per so the attacks in 2011 were
not difficult

104
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,560
ninety-six percent to the attacks I'm

105
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,009
ninety-seven percent affordable through

106
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,680
simple security controls hey this is the
majority what we're seeing out there

107
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,060
so unfortunately or fortunately I do I
look at it

108
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,520
hours I it is a is a a l'aide not let
this year but last year

109
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,669
and I was up a little and they asked me
this question

110
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,849
Joe mccurry Moschino Joel McCrea he was
the %uh moderator

111
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,340
and here headline manages days I why'd
you ask me that question

112
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,460
he asked me the question what do you
think the skills

113
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,159
0 anonymous right in an attacker

114
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,270
most up-to-date one thinking there's and
get right answer okay of answers I say

115
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,590
they're not very good

116
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,710
the primary target me right so what I do
what I answer

117
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,520
so what I said is we have it tested them
because %uh this

118
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,080
97 in this ninety-six percent the
majority these attacks

119
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,198
are not that sophisticated extremely for
it prevented with basic security

120
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,350
controls

121
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,740
so let's put the controls in place and
see how good they are

122
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,509
right let's challenge shallow don't be
our you know easy target

123
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,590
so less we looked at 2011 ninety-four
percent of the attacks were gonna

124
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,530
servers

125
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:01,530
2012 only 54 percent why

126
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,550
that's why wall by Lynn 2012 71 percent

127
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,250
we've talked about that here to cut
you've seen every time but every care in

128
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,389
their devices right

129
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,770
and it's funny because nowhere where you
go write an airport allows other day

130
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,549
every sinner like this that was got
devices writer always go like this

131
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,720
it used to be ever had the keypad to
keep as kinda went away

132
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,639
so tired but as always your swiping
their devices so this is the key we've

133
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,800
got now is the mobile devices and that's
why this number

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,030
has changed now only 78 percent in 2012

135
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,849
was low difficulty but still that's a
high number we want to be on the other

136
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:40,969
side to this

137
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,240
78 percent we want to make sure we put
security and defense is in place

138
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,680
that will make it more difficult day
make yourself a harder target

139
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,879
okay ingress in Bell filtering the sum
is concept has been around for a long

140
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,220
time

141
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,410
but most everybody does ingress
filtering

142
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,050
day something that works nobody knows oh
yes come in in tibet

143
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,449
okay get so we got that what's allowed
and configure your filters core sister

144
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:08,060
policy

145
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,699
gonna go through this very fast but it's
an easy one no traffic arrived for a

146
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,639
should have control source address right
sanity check

147
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,770
basic stuff but we get the last point we
got our see that helps your name is

148
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,889
radar sees

149
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,879
good for scarcely I'm Apple reply
messages broadcast address again does a

150
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,729
bit all used in attacks in their history
that iced

151
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:31,479
the only I want you to do though is if
you're in charge

152
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,689
you should know about blog I felt if
you're not in charge go to your network

153
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,940
for teamers security for all Team

154
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,409
and ask him do we ball downfield

155
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,080
if they look at you like you're talking
cling on or something you know you got a

156
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,870
problem

157
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,430
I'm Bob Garfield Ridge now new but it's
a concept we need to use today

158
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,489
because what bob outfielder love solely
those you don't know is

159
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,640
bogeys waterboy IP addresses I should
never say

160
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,500
K the pics another parallel that a lot
of people have problems with today

161
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,810
windows by default when you install it
puts ipv6 under

162
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,260
make sure you disable all your ipv6
traffic unless you're actually ipv6

163
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,519
because there's a lot of attacks already
happening over ipv6

164
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,950
rightmost your monitors are looking ipv6
so this blog outfielders all part of

165
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,800
that

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,000
real live date

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,450
nowhere affections when did a survey
whitten 18 organizations had all these

168
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,760
male were factions

169
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,089
sixty-four percent of the traffic
would've been blocked

170
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,230
by Bogdan filtering day so again is
mitigated the

171
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,360
risk from all this internet traffic that
we know we're gonna have

172
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,649
would have lotsa fitness or come in the
next part because

173
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,630
ingress everybody does egress

174
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,899
most I'll what Italian Pope

175
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:53,459
right what's our mentality we've been
training all these years that

176
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,660
oats out about his leave unless it's
good you but let it go up

177
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,579
day we have to change that outbound the
mentality why

178
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,390
because most attacks use both

179
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,069
addressee so if it comes to your
outbound filter all

180
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,450
and it's got a spoofed addresses should
never allow it out on your network

181
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,769
K those types of things we also have a
concept car black or routing

182
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,230
this works very well what that is is
most of us

183
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,190
on our client machine we have an
internal DNS server that we have to go

184
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,440
to our proxy

185
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,769
before we can go out right so on black
hole filter at your perimeter

186
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,190
you say if a source address called it is
not love the proxy

187
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,130
or that machine that allows traffic out
you just black hole

188
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,670
right know all 0 the Devon always will
call interface

189
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,899
out a router that prevents that traffic
from going out

190
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,279
okay we use is very successfully in LAX

191
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,510
LAX gets a lot of traffic you can
imagine Los Angeles Airport

192
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,660
thank you what seven girls at big giant
international terminal

193
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,640
at the stop this is what their biggest
things they used to help protect them

194
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,660
because Blackwell route has been around
for a while

195
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,050
but it works because most to this mill
where when he gets on your system does

196
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,870
what

197
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,240
photo-op right gets the data and sends
it out

198
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,930
so all you do is you make sure it is
smart enough

199
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,399
to go find your proxy and then go out if
you have a good proxy la times or drop

200
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,480
the traffic to

201
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,820
right and we'll talk here in a moment on
the next slide how you can set this up

202
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,829
and the challenges cuz I will meet with
people all the time

203
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:32,729
and I tell in this if you're not 24
hours a day seven days a week

204
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,230
shot of the Internet have a free shallow
ground which it should be rid of

205
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,279
which you can for your internal machines
right think about your internal machines

206
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,000
doing

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,920
they always need to be going out that
live connection going out to the

208
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,589
Internet

209
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,529
in most cases no I mean I agree I would
love to have it on

210
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,250
but the days we live in today that's
changed as we look at some love on a

211
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,370
boat is coming up

212
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,930
because of the border borders and things
like that we have to start thinking like

213
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,729
this

214
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,600
now to you absolutely positively can't
live without leaving your intro machines

215
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,060
on

216
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,189
because you are patches out also type
stuff start looking for

217
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,630
well-known ports a communications at
certain hours

218
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,050
K easy to set up time based access
control any the filters

219
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,529
the other routers the firewalls type a
sexist Royse City pssh

220
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,040
visitor well no one's a nowhere love to
use what you do

221
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,599
drop it block it don't allow that out
during certain hours

222
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,370
now I got it a little bit not lead to a
bit and add respecting lots o Balma

223
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,540
so many prime don't you store for DePaul
wrote several books is very big play in

224
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,149
a criminal and the Russian botnet and
all that type of stuff is a security i

225
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:45,870
and his concept was well the mail
where's always going to bed to get out

226
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,389
because you know there's gonna go out
there and strange hours and look like

227
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:50,589
normal traffic

228
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,630
day now the challenge I got for him was

229
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,730
most weekends or Friday Saturday

230
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,910
but what about the Middle East

231
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,079
United Arab Emirates the weekend is

232
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,329
friday saturday right Saturday Sunday US
what about

233
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,729
over all my

234
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,329
Saudi Arabia Thursday Friday your mail
was not that smart

235
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,500
mailers not gonna know when a weekend is
and that is right

236
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,670
so when I set up security operations
center the first one and allowed the

237
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,760
commercial sock

238
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,310
we identified hundreds a male were
factions just by

239
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,839
identifying the sportster well know from
our communications

240
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,880
any outbound traffic because we knew the
bank's

241
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,189
right they got a special weekend
Thursday Friday is directly everybody

242
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,029
and then friday saturday is the bank's

243
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,560
right like as everybody else in the GCC
the Gulf countries

244
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,579
is all Friday Saturday so the banks
match that but the commercial sectors

245
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,699
Thursday Friday

246
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,819
so we had all this traffic coming out
what are the banks that were monitoring

247
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,880
over there

248
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,930
so we drive over to the building trying
to see if it was there know it's locked

249
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,689
up tight

250
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,199
there's nobody there so wise the traffic
going up

251
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,430
nowhere affections were identified over
150 a one-week id

252
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,680
through the sock just by deploying this
type a type

253
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,779
it's hard because people don't want to
do it ok they want

254
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,209
you know what does everything all the
units always got the app right polled at

255
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:18,910
home and I believe you have turned a
profit of

256
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,990
they ever really just a plug your
broadband with this week what about all

257
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,740
the time

258
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,170
day so this is a concept if you can't do
it

259
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,079
subscribe to a service that looks for
lookups have known malware sites

260
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,880
day last part of talk about there's a
new one out there the star-news

261
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,709
or you can actually set this type of
thing up on Euro

262
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,849
do in shell script PowerShell stuff like
that gay web applications at Whitehead

263
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,010
hear that I'm so

264
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,449
I don't have to explain everybody how
important is the hardware that cations

265
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:49,779
with all that talk yesterday talk about
code right

266
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,350
come from a programming background all
we ever did in the early eighties all we

267
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,800
want to do is make our code working the
whole

268
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,979
got tired chase a semi colons at three
o'clock in the morning with the seal a

269
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,440
wish

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,079
so we went to end the game software
engineers and designers but you need to

271
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,638
harden these things as your web
applications

272
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,570
I'm what I like to do with clients I did
it with the United Nations

273
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,160
put in your contract vehicle if I get
compromised by

274
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,069
what are your web applications that I
paid you to build

275
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,290
/url yet to us is Joel McCrea option is
give me back ten percent the contract of

276
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,829
K another option is you just over pay
for the contract if you can't give me

277
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:27,729
code

278
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,329
the kid passed the basic testing guy
from the OWASP web application security

279
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,329
project

280
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:37,630
then I'm not going to allow you to get
paid for the contract

281
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,699
okay we did it United Nations six years
later they haven't really had many

282
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,089
attacks after they were having number of

283
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:47,380
attacks cousin the buggy coat so these
are things you can think about

284
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,019
okay harding systems we talked about but
what I want to talk about mainly is

285
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,389
Microsoft

286
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:56,079
how many people you skirted wires
manager a couple love you

287
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,439
everybody should we finally got
something from Microsoft you know in SA

288
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,550
center for and that security all these
things about all these cool stuff

289
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,370
we finally got something from Microsoft
that gives us

290
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,810
hardly unique customization love systems

291
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,880
so if you go in here the iron Explorer
89

292
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,000
office 2007 sir everything you can think
of

293
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,089
there's entire bass lines that will help
you configure it

294
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,060
in a more secure manner alright and I
can tell you now have to spend in a year

295
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,750
going to pretty much everybody have a
attacking forces in there when they head

296
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,970
when I hard to these guidelines none of
these attacks were working

297
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,100
side actually worked all these different
hacker contests el estaba stuff

298
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,620
put in hardened systems you don't pop

299
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,250
they make yourself harder target okay so

300
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,880
not that long ago this was put out by
first Australian singles division

301
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,009
in spit say and the SANS Institute
picked it up Alan Paller acceded

302
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:56,139
presentations out and they want to be
warned all those types of things

303
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,149
but they call these the top four
security controls

304
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,670
that would block eighty-five percent of
the attacks at the TAC

305
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,730
K the only one on this list that's
really new is what

306
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,299
application whitelisting but it works if
you have a set up some for application

307
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,139
whitelisting

308
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,010
you should again it's another deterrent
a different things you can do

309
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,770
the rest comes pretty easy patch patch
patch with all but that meant that broke

310
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,220
how about this one disable the local
admin account

311
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,860
a domain computers lot of people don't
do this but you should actually make

312
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,070
sure that what

313
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,649
local admin is not there remover
disabling

314
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,470
so I'm on the machine up of the box to
get a shell there is no local admin

315
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,340
account

316
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,399
K so I have to go one step further again
make it a little bit more difficult on

317
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
the attackers

318
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,340
okay so what stands did they took the
Australian singles group

319
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,270
I think it was 32 controls and they came
up with the Saints critical security

320
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,309
controls

321
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:58,889
alright and number five is made aware
defenses begin understanding that

322
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:04,010
these controls work so start trying to
deploy in implementing your organization

323
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,000
that's what we want to do in our
protections wanna make sure that we

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,480
start deploying these types of things to
make ourselves hard target

325
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,809
I'm okay getting Matt

326
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,389
got better scared right hackers and
they're happy

327
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,870
its I like are various so I've always
said for twenty years type thing

328
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm this is the problem art patch
systems broke

329
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,870
what is the second Tuesday 17 does patch

330
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,899
Tuesday yeah

331
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,990
does that mean that FREE just came out
on Tuesday

332
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,390
course not people in the know these
people know that right

333
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,390
what we call Wednesday in the hacking
world exploit Wednesday

334
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,559
cuz we passed Tuesday comes out like the
last one was what

335
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,760
15 or something critics on crazy me what
when it comes out

336
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,510
how many have you can catch within 24
hours

337
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,549
most organizations enterprises Kate or

338
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:05,510
soul where you go from a subset of a
small group that the researchers and

339
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,270
people who knew about this portability

340
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,080
then it goes out on Patch Tuesday who
knows about affordable and now

341
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,159
everybody so what do we do the hacker
start saying yeah I we got all these

342
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,200
exports now

343
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,549
because got a new vote abilities and
they have like oh two thumbs

344
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,389
ever heard export database those are
today's go there the next day after

345
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,400
practice Tuesday

346
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,070
here they got all these really cool
exploits ready to go then

347
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,600
in this we said most people don't get

348
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,939
the patches rollout maybe a week

349
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,150
all those days are export days for the
hacking side

350
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,880
I'm so this is how bad it gets I like
this site alibis ever seen it

351
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,900
zero day initiative up

352
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,830
so when I took a screenshot we had a CVS
comic or bus court security system

353
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,899
love 9.3 the highest is a tip

354
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,039
such a critical high water billing and

355
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,020
the vendor has known about it for a
hundred eighty-three days:

356
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,668
a bit naive enough to think that just
that security researcher here

357
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:13,150
anyway is the only person I found that
you're the only

358
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,409
K this is why our pad system is broken
but the best we have

359
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,179
because remember it will tour the top
four controls worst patch everything

360
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,510
right and then everybody's favorite
target

361
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,450
Adobe to whatever loves Adobe yuri

362
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,450
you something else don't use Adobe
there's other PDF readers

363
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,610
K again understand this is a high-value
target

364
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,389
27.5 not as bad but it's a 198 days old

365
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,690
up now I love this park is a bear no
zero day initiative cultural tipping

366
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,630
point

367
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,620
tipping point was actually purchased by
HP

368
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,678
so HP is on the list just like they put
themselves i report all the time

369
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,450
in their own list so sometimes I wonder
does HP even know this list exists

370
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,630
because it came from you know tipping
point date so they got the most critical

371
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,669
severity on their own HP

372
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,350
it's a kid as 420 today's all

373
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,908
they put themselves are report all the
time ok

374
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:15,950
and us to up tents the most critical
severe give our body we can have

375
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,020
as 400 for two days I'll ever remember
it wasn't that long ago bro for four

376
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,539
years

377
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,210
Microsoft past affordability of four
years old

378
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,750
they knew about it for four years K
that's why the patch system

379
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,909
it's not gonna save us we have to use it
no book

380
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:36,429
it's not gonna save us was saved you is
ingress egress filtering through

381
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,900
murdered identify when you get
compromised

382
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,240
because there's always a chance to board
a boat is gonna get you cuz

383
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,880
are we ever going to get that uses the
stop clicking

384
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,620
I never stopped liking no always gonna
quick

385
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,549
episode although there is getting
smarter no its not gonna happen

386
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,639
right Englander places like that they
would ever if it's going out World Cup

387
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,480
200,000 infections because they set out
fishing a mother said a click here for

388
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,210
latest news the World Cup

389
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,990
200,000 change in fact that fast I'm and
now with the social networking errands

390
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,840
evening hours

391
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,280
ok memory analysis so what do you do
after you get

392
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,428
compromised you like 10 going to
compromise reality is a summer target

393
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:20,000
you they're gonna get it

394
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,450
so segmentation and that isolation is

395
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,659
put the actual machine in that area
where you can't go anywhere else

396
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,380
I'm I like this all the story of the
Navy

397
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,000
as a chief and I love working with the
battle group setting up the actual

398
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,610
accounts for the admiral

399
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,469
so I going to the Devils cabin right now
I'm in there like chief

400
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,510
got talked about some low-grade ever
want to talk to me what the heck you

401
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,640
won't talk to me about

402
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,900
egos I need a easy password

403
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,390
first compute other walser the
requirements are this and this and this

404
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,400
is like chief

405
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
I'm Nabil your chief you gotta do it
anyway the Navy

406
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,629
okay collar device Mike flip toward my
car advice is higher nears those types

407
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,280
of things

408
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,309
so you really wanna a four digit
password

409
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:10,928
but I'm like can I tell him no

410
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,850
watch it was going to happen %uh price
Toby chief but overall there being a lot

411
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,139
of trouble as a chief

412
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,490
right so I can't I'm no so what we do we
gave him a segment of his old isolated

413
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,090
Hill

414
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,750
gave him his services he needed any has
four digit password

415
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,260
but nobody ever really we worry about
because he was isolated

416
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,820
you get his radio message traffic which
were delivered to him he can get his

417
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,200
little internet access email stuff like
that

418
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,990
when he was out separate from the
network is all show towards the end

419
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,980
with a secure network architecture these
are the things you have to start

420
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,380
thinking about is segmentation isolation

421
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,580
because it the business needs their and
it dries our revenue

422
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,990
we're gonna do it we're gonna do it as
far as the application mission-critical

423
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,250
whatever it is

424
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,960
so isolated on your network is not a new
concept

425
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,090
but people think that way is put
everything in all together

426
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,070
right okay so running processes we see
so many stores yesterday so what's been

427
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,230
to a style

428
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,970
but the main thing to realize is was
somebody gets on your machine and

429
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,360
compromises it

430
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,789
you gotta try to look at okay what
happened

431
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:18,110
right so you're doing your egress
filtering you set up the egress

432
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,189
filtering talk about

433
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,640
you've identified a machine that is
suspicious cuz just traffic going out to

434
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,409
the Internet

435
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:28,610
so you start looking at the memory so
the first thing you want to look for is

436
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,500
a less this is PS list will says
internal directive times over that

437
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,549
because most male where if it's not
sophisticated

438
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:39,908
is gonna rename itself ass SBC hope
service hosted by Lowes

439
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:44,980
SBC host right so when you look here all
these SVC host a lot so the O

440
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,169
threads and handles all that type of
stuff went down here

441
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:51,179
we gotta in seeing what was seen that
yesterday neck at

442
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,020
that's a Trojan we had SPC host here
that looks kinda suspicious

443
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,918
is down here but looking at this list
you really don't know

444
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,890
what's actually taken place or not so

445
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,289
this is a little bit better SPS list one
st gives you

446
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,980
this is what we call process it to
scenes that is parent-child relationship

447
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,000
so now when you look at this all these
SVC Hosur children of

448
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,400
services what about this as we see host
down here

449
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,250
who is a child of you don't have a pair

450
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:33,190
you have to I would occur well as I get
into cloning all that stuff

451
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,720
guy so we start looking this SBC ho says
in a day

452
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,520
doesn't have all the services this is
tasked was force as as we say

453
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,200
these are suspicious we start doing
memory analysis with all these really

454
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,230
cool tools we have some great tools out
there

455
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,380
made its free redline very good lot of
other tools the problem is

456
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,159
there's lots of false positives you have
to manually go in here look at the

457
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,440
information right

458
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,690
and then we love process explore is
Process Explorer breaks it out shows us

459
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,740
in sees right here SBC host right here

460
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,640
and the normal SPC hosts a generic host
process a Windows

461
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,039
and Microsoft Corporation but down here
what to say

462
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,700
nothing that suspicious right these are
the types of things you have to do

463
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,539
when you start doing memory analysis
what you identify somebody's been

464
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,549
compromised

465
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:25,658
I'm isn't just mentioned many times in
the talks yesterday

466
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:29,179
it's very sophisticated you may never
know what happened other than the fact

467
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,799
that it's got internet connection is
trying to go out to the internet because

468
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,279
you're black hole filtering or something
identified it

469
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:37,799
so what do you do maybe rebuild the box

470
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,059
some guys just had to rebuild the box
I'm a sophisticated malware

471
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:46,320
know that works you have to look at the
actual raw image in most cases there's

472
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,168
pulled

473
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,190
that you dynamic analysis in all those
types of things

474
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,860
but if someone let's talk online up in
the offline you get with Jordan told I

475
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,908
have tested

476
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:59,279
there's a lot of false positives it's
much better to take the actual raw image

477
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,539
and then analyze it with the Twlight
memorize %ah

478
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:06,200
volatility there's a lot of different
tools you can use but

479
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,340
most in the tools I views life

480
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,029
has a lot of false positives and I just
don't have time to go through and

481
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:18,200
no I I did one for a a a very large %uh
vendor in the Middle East

482
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,460
it I've never seen nothing like

483
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,100
every day I machine we pulled up server
whatever

484
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,270
hundreds a process is that we're all
infected cordless tools

485
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,929
like this is it safe so what we do we
picked up we started our egress

486
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:35,659
filtering so we did we just shut the
door for everybody

487
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:38,940
one week it and we watch traffic coming
to the perimeter

488
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,299
we found a 150 malware infections that
weekend again there's a lot of

489
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,250
environments out there are affected

490
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,390
because everybody is doing the online
thing

491
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,390
right so we have to look at so what I do
is I look for hooks test the old

492
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,450
traditional way of doing mail where

493
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,120
hooking into the SSDT years ITT right
ever there's like that

494
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,408
this one I made easy cuz I caught a
virus

495
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:06,149
evasive see that right so I train people
this but what the important part is

496
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:07,020
virus

497
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,820
when you go into the hook so the system
services duty descriptor table

498
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,799
you see here hi DVR for a career-high
DVR to

499
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,840
that actually a rootkit lacks actually a
rootkit

500
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,020
that's a hooking rootkit K which is more
get traditional rootkit

501
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,918
your D Kyle drucker logic manipulations
will have hooks

502
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,880
she look for ports if there's no ports
you gotta walk in look at the dll's

503
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,179
is a dynamic link libraries the low
enough that will

504
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:39,539
usually identify with the mail where is
this is kinda we're at today

505
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,779
what you get compromise so pledge is
going to have to rebuild the box

506
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:47,000
is male workers more more sophisticated
I'm as was mentioned yesterday

507
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,419
when did the talking showed Sandboxie
the bought a boat is there and

508
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:51,370
everything right

509
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,610
that's because the curl the way Windows
implemented the curl

510
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,330
is what we like to call broken only use
it to other four rings with Intel

511
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,360
Architecture

512
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,809
K I had slides and all that buzz word
about time said to get out

513
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:07,070
but for those you don't know all usual
process is spent time in

514
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,559
crow those discussed yesterday so
watching Carlo

515
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,418
up everything so when we saw yesterday
is he took over Carrillo

516
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,149
we take over per load you tell the
operating system or the applications

517
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:24,260
what you want them to see K and as I
said that's an architectural issue

518
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,809
that prime Microsoft will never fix I'm

519
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,408
so now we're equal system not to spill
out I'm at it's a lot of money involved

520
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:32,020
right

521
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,470
ever there you could do cell doing time

522
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,779
so help a big really need help

523
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:44,110
give Microsoft credit I've bass
Microsoft for twenty-plus years

524
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,529
it lamb and hash we love it yeah that's
the biggest open or we love it all that

525
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:48,140
type stuff

526
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,720
but they've gotten better right to hire
workers and other stuff like that

527
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,730
they actually neighbor reviews
Metasploit the martyr for Shell

528
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,340
guy who wrote escape he's been a
Microsoft now for quite a few years

529
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,389
try to prevent his own tool hey so

530
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,820
Microsoft into a lotta but they give us
the enhanced mitigation experience

531
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,299
toolkit

532
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:11,510
he met now you're seeing a lot of these
attacks against Data Execution

533
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,700
know at times to so this tries to add
obstacles to exploitation

534
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,200
it's not perfect but it's great because
they had a contest

535
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,200
the guy who compromise it last year
blackhead F cup

536
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,270
with two dates they had a new update

537
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,600
in that out so it's not perfect but I
got them over get time

538
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,779
where I can show hard nosed legacy
applications

539
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:36,549
if you have to run Adobe because you
have me all managers and people just

540
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:37,720
love Adobe

541
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,860
put it into the email protection okay

542
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:46,029
it's very powerful to do it blocks
execution of a lot in these exports

543
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:49,760
well talk about the end what they're
doing up Adobe I always put

544
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,580
ne'matt because it's always going to
have our bodies is cross-platform ever

545
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,960
loved

546
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,600
so we took 27 sample S was de Quito and
his project the export project

547
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,129
he met mitigated 2227 easily

548
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,760
just basically put into the system

549
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,789
all but one was mitigated years in Libya
configuration in the one we could

550
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:12,010
mitigate

551
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:18,179
Firefox I'm so again you have to look at
this in your organization say okay

552
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,700
there's no password is no patch
available we use it or what

553
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,120
just start looking for machines that
have Firefox on a

554
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,209
have activity network activity back and
forth

555
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,760
OCR how good the hacker is when I get on
the box they have yet date out of the

556
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,480
box

557
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,510
right or get another box start looking
at those communication channels

558
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,590
we know we can prevent the users who
click okay there's email show you some

559
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,590
examples

560
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:46,840
see exp 8/ 28 2003 Vista 2008 right all
these types of things

561
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,959
all the protections Data Execution
Prevention right

562
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,130
address baseless layout randomization
ASLR all those types of things

563
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:58,110
they're available it's free install it

564
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,500
I'm today on your critical boxes and
this is what it looks like

565
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,510
so we go here is just running processes
you can figure system here you click

566
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,850
Configure application

567
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,840
and you just at applications into the he
met protection

568
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,519
and that's what I've done here after a
kid %uh Adobe

569
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,570
Excel Firefox I explore for an explorer
MS in Outlook PowerPoint when word

570
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,710
and added them all into in that
configuration

571
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,130
so the shows you all the protections
that are available any met

572
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,590
I'm so as we got down here now and
you're seeing that I've actually got

573
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,789
Skype Credit Skype in their right here

574
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,789
in a protection he sprayed all these
other types exploit opportunities

575
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,580
and it's not perfect but it makes in
raises the bar the attacker

576
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,949
always were making it more difficult for
reducing our threat vector

577
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,320
who are we going to have her attack
surface with I'm Server 2008 some other

578
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,289
protections

579
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,960
nap Network Access Protection ever used
it yet

580
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,690
no day it may hurt network access
control Mac

581
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,769
to now Microsoft gives you a solution in
Microsoft

582
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:07,960
you have to go out by that third party
product I'm part way of life while but

583
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,840
actually build a lot OVA

584
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,600
IP Sekai isolation DHCP isolation use in
their nap with in 2008 I do to my

585
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,730
advanced network defense course I've
written

586
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,649
allow to cool things you can do their
Paki we saw some other problems with

587
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:21,750
that yesterday

588
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,230
because if the keys are stored it's of
work

589
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,720
if macro level what can I do

590
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,230
yeah Dolce tortoise of or put a hardware

591
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,070
a hardware-based protections Trusted
Platform Module TPM stuff like that

592
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,779
read-only domain controllers and by
using this one this is great there's a

593
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,250
lotta sites I can isolate or can't
protect physically

594
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,140
nobody knows about physically touching
machine I own a machine right

595
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,519
so I can set up a read-only domain
controller racket right

596
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,019
to the actual Active Directory see no
buses compromise

597
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,309
there's no way to compromise actually
Active Directory if you haven't used it

598
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:00,158
for a highly recommend looking at

599
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,899
good there we can do a lot of diverse of
restrictions

600
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:07,580
Server 2012 it by using it

601
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,949
secure boot based windows 8 was the
first one to do it

602
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:15,649
this is hardware-based boo protection
because if the book bloc group kids and

603
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:16,810
all the other cool stuff

604
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,549
what they do is they look at a hash of
the kernel the last known good colonel

605
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,589
was shut out

606
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:24,889
it comes up it doesn't match it doesn't
boo

607
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,480
day so you might want to look at that
they actually even have DNS actors DNS

608
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,440
is always been an attack type thing

609
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,550
and it's more secure robust in easier
than 2008

610
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,560
get better and then this thing in 2008
you have what's called a Server Core

611
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,129
installation

612
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:43,790
where you can install Windows will have
to do it

613
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,659
ever done that that server course that's
really cool but the problem is sir 2008

614
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,050
is

615
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,619
what you do that you can never go grab a
good

616
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:57,170
right so what they do in 2012 you can
load ago use it no load

617
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,280
K so little bit different personal a
cover for Unix world where unix way

618
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,190
before they also

619
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,450
I would rather never have to do it K

620
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,310
that's cuz I liked a birdie on the
command line I get all my students come

621
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:08,700
in

622
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,348
they'll pull up zine map and those in
med school easy to use but now I'm

623
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:13,540
command lifers

624
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm but now with 2012 you can actually
loaded doing unloaded

625
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,220
at uni that's pretty cool and there's
the ass a secure boot architecture for

626
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,169
Windows 8 Server 2012

627
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,829
and it shows you how the sequence
everything set up

628
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:32,400
in the GPL the Trusted Platform Module
so there actually is a secure boot

629
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,329
sequence

630
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:37,720
in the TPM if you've never done it is
actually pretty cool because we saw all

631
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,868
during a demonstration yesterday
stealing

632
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:44,410
I'll certificates in smart card
credentials all that type of stuff

633
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,819
why do a similar type of attack with
that but if I do use a Trusted Platform

634
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,750
Module hardware baser

635
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,480
the attack fails because it goes a look
at the hash in hardware

636
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,510
and says this doesn't match doesn't give
me the information to the date

637
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,650
I'm now we've got ever do a
bring-your-own-device

638
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:08,730
up okay bro where are the standard 8.o
2.1 AR

639
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,530
some love you this is actually secure
device identity

640
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,849
this is set up to give us protection for
our

641
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:19,460
mobile devices the problem is where is
it

642
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,070
vero says 2009 you give a device I did
device

643
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,410
they're trying to do hardware-based
Trusted Platform Module also type of

644
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:27,920
stuff

645
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,960
we were promised 2012 ok

646
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,300
to good we know the phone attacks are on
the rise

647
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,420
if you have a mobile device identity it
helps protect it again it's another

648
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,119
layer of protection

649
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,369
there's no perfect security we know that
we make it more difficult

650
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,710
I as I said mobile Trusted Platform
Module

651
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,089
in TPM we thought it would release in
2012 ok

652
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:56,430
it device identity where you talk about

653
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,690
Apple whats app always do well you guys
doing to our and our ok

654
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,890
so they decided to go proprietor so how
good is it

655
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,078
friends out the proprietor solution it
all the I can say about that

656
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:12,839
mmmm lamb and ash no peer review

657
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:16,299
how about web wired for the privacy all
the time said no peer review

658
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,599
so is a peer review on this proprietary
only the people they pay

659
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,250
thank so we trust them up some people
well

660
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,390
get so I put the slide up because

661
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,720
I would see me fifty to a hundred
attacks and our

662
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,598
in the nap something with %uh
politically in the world because we were

663
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,290
military government all the time
suffered

664
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,540
yo ships all the regions I see in the
North Lake ocean

665
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,190
we'll see that's quite 250-300 tax an
hour

666
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,050
everyone to sit there and try to go
through it by doing dallas is served by

667
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,930
DS logs and Farrell all da time stuff

668
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,299
yeah but is a site is watching grass
grow right earlier

669
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,109
okay yeah so what we did is we had to
come up with a better way

670
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:05,078
so most people right you have your DMZ
either here we call it the public games

671
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:08,040
ear today with security plus they like
to do it all for here

672
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,410
separate service a subnet Neil all kinda
crazy buzzwords the

673
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,740
belts and suspenders architecture the
thing is though

674
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,759
when you do this you have to allow all
this traffic

675
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,760
through your first layer efforts to you

676
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,640
effectively in all avoided your first
layer defense

677
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,540
so what's a better way to do it move it

678
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:34,020
off to its old interface offer your main
traffic

679
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,890
this does one of two things one

680
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,720
any traffic in here now that has port 80

681
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,598
northern cool portable as the fine web
applications all the cool stuff

682
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,270
anything and here's malicious sky like a
honeypot DMZ

683
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,869
oh honey that why is no traffic should
be in here

684
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:57,609
is should all be here it's actually
pretty easy to do also

685
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:02,190
all this traffic here is now offer your
main traffic

686
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,940
and it increases your performance
amazingly

687
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,849
much much faster I've so what we would
do is

688
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:13,470
we would put app servers there

689
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:18,299
and ITES right here why because if any
traffic destined to port 80

690
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,579
your 22 all these other ports that are
usually in the DMZ near the supper

691
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,369
service a sudden that those isolated

692
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:29,640
it was malicious I N that was the only
time I would have an actual indication

693
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,490
alert page me and tell me

694
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,459
hey I've got malicious traffic right
those types of things

695
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,690
it's an amazing concept it works so well
because

696
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,339
as soon as I got traffic around it I was
concerned about what we do

697
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,720
we go into his most intrusion analyst do
isolation mode we say okay do we have

698
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,709
any sessions

699
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,589
heard any sessions with this traffic
because sessions means

700
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:56,359
somebody prolly had a zero-day attacks
is compromised it so I have a session

701
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:59,990
right those I said it and then we
started trying to isolate the leveraged

702
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:03,819
level and knowledge in the attacker
right we want to know the skill set

703
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:08,319
K so what we had was is we head

704
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,329
if they were coming at us with Windows
nothing is Windows people but twenty

705
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,119
years ago specially

706
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,740
we put him in a low priority queue no
serious hacker would become a net use

707
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,720
Windows

708
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,828
K these are all things we can do in our
environment

709
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:25,460
okay segmentation isolation what you do
here is

710
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,030
you put your services they're like
member that averell we called it is I'll

711
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,410
enamel Island

712
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,779
we put your service in here so big it's
compromised

713
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,680
you can't go this direction is totally
untrusted nothing can go this way

714
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,848
guy those you can for your firewall
before you configure it for what we call

715
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:43,930
absorb

716
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,660
you only absorb the package you don't
respond you make it much harder on the

717
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,480
attack

718
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,960
okay by imports inside the bastion host

719
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,079
the box here the bastion host but all
the ports you need for the entire world

720
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:55,829
network

721
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:59,250
invited inside it so we'll talk about
live with that

722
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,829
smoothwall base will walk nice free when
it's got a commercial 12

723
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:07,530
what I love about this this is a default
installation a small wall

724
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,500
this is inbound network traffic all I
did was install this box I love the

725
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,890
ISO image what's allowed ok

726
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,770
I nothing walk cuz its im bout

727
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,880
smoothwall does nobody should be coming
inbound unless you give them

728
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,480
explicit permission to come and bow but
if you use a secure network architecture

729
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,660
you don't have to give them anything
it's all in the other DMZ

730
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,899
so by attacking this box there's nothing
nothing open

731
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,170
of 65535 border closed or

732
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:44,060
65,000 36 if count 0 this is the type of
things you have to start thinking about

733
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,160
hey I'm sure how good a hacker is it the
boss doesn't have a port open

734
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,848
I can attack it was somebody physically
gets on orkut on something

735
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,359
ok egress

736
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:58,700
by default it binds all the porch your
users typically need

737
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,848
for the internal network to go out to
the Internet right remote access all the

738
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:03,520
time sup

739
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,910
they do that by default so just by stole
a small wallet default configuration

740
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,328
you have solid ingress filtering and
egress filtering

741
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:16,079
that you can actually even make it more
granular but by default it has this

742
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,390
all set up are ready ready for you ready
to go K

743
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:24,900
powerful things we can do okay so we're
not into

744
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,020
what I want to show your is

745
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,970
he met K so if I go in here

746
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,939
last time I got left okay

747
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:41,430
demos %uh tinsel spoo

748
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,310
that would do that ok

749
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,790
what we're doing here is ms-13 009

750
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:52,500
so I do is I take the latest and
greatest part abilities

751
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,670
and I wrote no to see if I can explode
all by themselves flat

752
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,220
cuz I tell people trade have been
testing if you can get a flat networking

753
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,379
never going to get it to a far lower
filter

754
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:06,150
right so I do here ms-13 zara zara zara
I'm

755
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,589
is I got a martyr parish al and I'm
gonna keep getting the user to click a

756
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:10,230
link

757
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,760
as users are you click alright sort out
right now here is the explore decision

758
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,530
see it's in an HTML

759
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,890
so those who do exploitation is it 100
percent

760
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,960
no that's why don't wanna try live am

761
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,359
so will keep hittin it

762
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:31,700
now goes Bay meter per session opening

763
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,460
spawning the process to notepad migrated
it why because most people see no

764
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,220
pattern I'm gonna kill nope at

765
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,049
so therefore exploit still go on and
there it is successfully migrated the

766
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:41,910
process

767
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,810
now this is brand new use after free
voter body Internet Explorer

768
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:49,619
I'm sorta like to do is what I've tested
it saying I can do it

769
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,829
I'm going to try to mitigate

770
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:56,030
was at school I say we have help from
Microsoft

771
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,290
he met up so let speed up your internet

772
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:04,029
he met

773
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,800
numbed up in hatches a plan after but
that's alright with the lot hackers

774
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,369
so there's a net snow

775
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:15,339
actually gonna turn on he met and when I
turn Oni met

776
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:19,150
we'll see if the attack works or doesn't
work I'm

777
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:24,750
so I just go in i at find the execute a
book

778
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:31,530
and I just at it

779
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:38,530
I E because I he's got the vote ability

780
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,850
now I still got my sessions just to show
you I added he met

781
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,000
pesto can enter at my session to hack
the box and all that type of stuff

782
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,450
because it's after the fact

783
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,520
to any daddy in there in our hardening
configuration guidelines

784
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,890
right time so now what I'm gonna do is

785
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,040
star traci again

786
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,540
and seeing if I can

787
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:10,590
compromised LCD

788
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:15,210
the time to show any extra stuff here
just showing you where it's protected

789
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:15,680
area

790
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,430
there's my hashed out

791
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,859
see my URL

792
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:32,110
I keep it my URL sending HTML so it did
it's got some stuff

793
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:39,110
what's happening here email is stopping
it call

794
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,600
so no matter what I try to do try to
play hacker dojo and all that type of

795
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:45,960
stuff

796
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,720
it continually he met continues to stop
it see that he met notify writer

797
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,790
he met notify rock and it continues to
do it

798
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:58,410
it tries a heat spray shut it down I'm

799
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:01,420
it tries a see ya shut it down

800
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,119
tries that such it shuts all these
exploitable

801
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,930
options down just by didn't take law

802
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,640
so what do you do you go into those
mission-critical a virus that you can

803
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,450
segment isolate and you put emailed on
their

804
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,669
and you put these applications in there
that your users want to run

805
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:22,970
that we really don't want to run but we
can say no

806
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:27,160
member dabble right so so if we can say
no we have to run it

807
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,410
so don't matter I'll go stop them over a
minute closed out

808
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:34,410
but every time I try to get in there its
topical

809
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:39,390
I'm if you haven't used the Met I highly
recommend you download and install it

810
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,618
and it really does work your Microsoft
credit

811
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:46,080
they got a SolidWorks it always do that

812
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,330
okay I did their windows far-off not
gonna do but that actually is

813
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:55,029
eventos in map right takin map

814
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:59,780
to run Windows Firewall runnin map wifi
adores advanced scanning techniques the

815
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,930
actual if you need the

816
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,970
command line let me know and see if it
works stops in coal

817
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,980
even in map the most popular open-source
candor cannot penetrate the latest

818
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,390
version Windows Firewall

819
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:16,900
give Microsoft credit they've gotten
better okay case study 2012 right 2012

820
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,430
Olympics

821
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,450
pretty powerful high profile bit think
hackers but one attack it

822
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:27,129
we built an entire security operations
center for the advent head over six

823
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,140
6600 incident tilt

824
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,350
only six it ever made it to an
escalation purposes and never known to

825
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:34,810
them

826
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,350
were successful okay so defense does
work

827
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:42,220
we can do it what about internal
honeypots

828
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,950
there you go your mail where we know

829
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,210
if it gets in have internal honey pot a
traffic to neutral honey pot

830
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,350
dead giveaway you've got nowhere in your
environment

831
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:59,420
I'm breaking news from microsoft black
at USA 2013

832
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,950
contest a break he met they had it last
year within two days they had a new one

833
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:04,350
out

834
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:08,100
but this year they're going really
really I know the prizes

835
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,730
a hundred thousand US dollars

836
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,000
soviet thinking sit down on their
machine a break he met

837
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,690
they'll pay you a hundred thousand
dollars if you can do it that

838
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,700
is a pretty good contest now that so

839
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:29,700
any questions they got very a minute yes

840
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,279
up

841
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:40,539
renaming well the problem is most people
know if you rename it

842
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:43,999
is still we love the call it the said
it's really the rid the relative I D

843
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:47,919
is 500 so is a lot of tools and stuff
like still pull all the accounts with

844
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,809
that five hundred

845
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:52,990
think so you can rename it it's one step
but hacker just has to know

846
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,859
user to said said usual some cool little
tools for love for Timothy mollen

847
00:48:56,859 --> 00:48:59,880
and then they can actually pull the date
out but it is

848
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:06,240
deterred day in Wales alright

849
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:12,910
think that cool thank you

850
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,019
thanks Kevin actually on your critical
boxes and this is what it looks like

851
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:21,129
so we go here is just running processes
you can figure system here you click

852
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,930
Configure application and you just

853
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:28,180
at applications into the he met
protection and that's what I've done

854
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,490
here after a kid

855
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:35,479
%uh Adobe Excel Firefox I explore for an
explorer MS in Outlook PowerPoint when

856
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:35,990
word

857
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,160
and added them all into in that
configuration

858
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,489
so this shows you all the protections
that are available ne'matt

859
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:47,210
I'm so as we got down here now and
you're seeing that I've actually got

860
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,190
Skype Credit Skype in their right here

861
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:53,140
in a protection he sprayed all these
other types exploit opportunities

862
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,058
it's not perfect but it makes in raises
the bar the attacker

863
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:01,549
always were making it more difficult for
reducing our threat vector

864
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:05,940
who are we going to have her attack
surface with I'm Server 2008 some other

865
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,690
protections

866
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,829
nap Network Access Protection ever used
it yet

867
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:14,569
no it may hurt network access control
Mac

868
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:19,200
to now Microsoft gives you a solution in
Microsoft

869
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,578
you have to go out by that third party
product I'm fought way of life while but

870
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,150
actually build a lot OVA

871
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:30,220
IP Sekai salacious DHCP isolation use in
their nap with in 2008 I do to my

872
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,930
advanced network defense course I've
written

873
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:36,399
allow to cool things you can do their PK
I we saw some other problems with that

874
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,249
yesterday

875
00:50:37,249 --> 00:50:42,410
because if the keys are stored it's of
work if macro level what can I do

876
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:46,279
yeah Dolce tortoise of four

877
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:50,299
put it in hardware a hardware-based
protections Trusted Platform Module TPM

878
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:51,569
stuff like that

879
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:55,089
read-only domain controllers and by
using this one

880
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:59,599
this is great there's a lotta sites I
can isolate or can't protect physically

881
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,279
never knows a physically touching
machine I own a machine right

882
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:06,779
so I can set up a read-only domain
controller racket right

883
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:10,499
to the actual Active Directory see no
buses compromise

884
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:13,930
there's no way to compromise actually
Active Directory if you haven't used it

885
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,549
for a highly recommend looking at

886
00:51:15,549 --> 00:51:18,690
K there we can do a lot of diverse of
restrictions

887
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:24,069
Server 2012 it by using it secure boot

888
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:28,119
based windows 8 was the first one to do
it this is hardware-based

889
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,349
boo protection because if the book bloc
group kids and all the other cool stuff

890
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:36,170
what they do is they look at a hash of
the kernel the last known good colonel

891
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,099
was shut out

892
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:40,160
if it comes up it doesn't match it
doesn't poop

893
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,089
day so you might want to look at that
they actually even have DNS actors DNS

894
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:48,640
is always been an attack type thing and
is more secure robust

895
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,019
in easier than 2008 get better and then
this thing

896
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:55,220
in 2008 you have what's called a Server
Core installation

897
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,549
where you can install Windows will have
to do it

898
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:04,269
ever done that that server course that's
really cool but the problem is sir 2008

899
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:04,598
is

900
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,690
what you do that you can never go grab a
good right

901
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,539
so what they do in 2012 you can load ago
use it no load

902
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:16,920
good so little bit different personal a
cover for Unix world new units where

903
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,989
were they also I would rather

904
00:52:18,989 --> 00:52:22,950
never have to do it okay that's cuz I
like typing on the command line

905
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,499
I get all my students come in they'll
pull up zine map and those in med school

906
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:28,819
easy to use but now I'm command lifers

907
00:52:28,819 --> 00:52:33,460
I'm but now with 2012 you can actually
loaded doing unloaded

908
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,839
at uni that's pretty cool and there's
the ass a secure boot architecture for

909
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,519
Windows 8 Server 2012

910
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,439
and it shows you how the sequence
everything set up

911
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,019
in the GPL the Trusted Platform Module
so there actually is a secure boot

912
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:48,758
sequence

913
00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:53,220
in the TPM if you've never done it is
actually pretty cool because we saw all

914
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,488
during a demonstration yesterday
stealing

915
00:52:56,489 --> 00:52:59,880
I'll certificates and smart card
credentials all that type of stuff

916
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,900
why do a similar type of attack with
that but

917
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,359
if I do use a Trusted Platform Module
hardware baser

918
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:10,089
the attack fails because it goes a look
at the hash in hardware

919
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:14,130
and says this doesn't match doesn't give
me the information to the date

920
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:19,269
I'm now we've got ever do a
bring-your-own-device

921
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:24,348
up okay bro where are the standard 8.o
2.1 they are

922
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:28,150
some love you this is actually secure
device identity

923
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,470
this is set up to give us protection for
our

924
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:35,069
mobile devices the problem is where is
it

925
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:39,690
vero says 2009 you give a device ID did
device

926
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,029
they're trying to do hardware-based
Trusted Platform Module also type of

927
00:53:43,029 --> 00:53:43,549
stuff

928
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:46,569
we were promised 2012 ok

929
00:53:46,569 --> 00:53:50,910
to good we know the phone attacks are on
the rise

930
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:55,038
if you have a mobile device identity it
helps protect it again it's another

931
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,739
layer of protection

932
00:53:56,739 --> 00:54:00,989
there's no perfect security we know that
we make it more difficult

933
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:05,329
I as I set mobile Trusted Platform
Module

934
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:08,710
in TPM we thought it would release in
2012 ok

935
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,029
it device I'd anywhere to talk about

936
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:17,299
Apple whats app always do well you guys
do it you out and are ok

937
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:21,509
so they decided to go proprietor so how
good is it

938
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:24,690
pans out the proprietor solution it all
the I can say about that

939
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,450
mmmm lamb and ash no peer review

940
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:31,910
how about web Wired Equivalent Privacy
all the time said no peer review

941
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:37,210
so is a peer review on this proprietary
only the people they pay

942
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:40,869
very so we trust them up some people
well

943
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:45,000
get so I put the slide up because

944
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,329
I would see fifty to a hundred attacks
and our

945
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:52,559
in the NAP something went up politically
in the world because we were military

946
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:53,900
government all the time suffered

947
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,150
yo ships all the regions I see in the
North Lake ocean

948
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,809
we'll see this white 250-300 tax an hour

949
00:55:00,809 --> 00:55:03,839
everyone to sit there and try to go
through and I do analysis uva

950
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,900
ideas logs and Farrell all da time stuff
yeah

951
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,910
but is a site is watching grass grow
right /url

952
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,730
okay yeah so what we did is we had to
come up with a better way

953
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:20,700
so most people right you have your DMZ
either here we call it the public games

954
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,649
ear today with security plus they like
to do it all for here

955
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:28,019
separate service a subnet Neil all kinda
crazy buzzwords the

956
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:31,319
belts and suspenders architecture the
thing is though

957
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:34,380
when you do this you have to allow all
this traffic

958
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:39,599
through your first layer efforts to you
effectively Nall avoided your

959
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,769
first layer defense so what's a better
way to do it

960
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:47,098
move it off to its old

961
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:53,509
interface offer your main traffic this
does one of two things one

962
00:55:53,509 --> 00:55:57,339
any traffic in here now that has port 80

963
00:55:57,339 --> 00:56:01,210
northern cool portable as the fine web
applications all the cool stuff

964
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,880
anything and here's militias sky like a
honeypot DMZ

965
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,489
honey in it why there's no traffic
should be in here

966
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:13,230
you should all be here it's actually
pretty easy to do also

967
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:17,809
all this traffic here is now offer your
main traffic

968
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:21,549
and it increases your performance
amazingly

969
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:25,460
much much faster I'm so what we would do
is

970
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,079
we would put app servers there

971
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:33,920
and ITES right here why because if any
traffic destined to port 80

972
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,200
year 22 all these other ports that are
usually in the DMZ near the supper

973
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,980
service a sudden that those are so they

974
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,230
it was malicious I N that was the only
time

975
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:47,099
I would have an actual indication alert
page me and tell me

976
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:52,079
hey I've got malicious traffic right
those types of things

977
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,309
it's an amazing concept it works so well
because

978
00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:58,950
as soon as I got traffic around it I was
concerned about what we do

979
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:03,339
we go into his most intrusion analyst do
isolation mode we say okay do we have

980
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:04,328
any sessions

981
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:08,210
heard any sessions with this traffic
because sessions means

982
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,969
some paper I had a zero-day attacks is
compromised it so I have a session

983
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:15,609
right those I said it and then we
started trying to isolate the levered

984
00:57:15,609 --> 00:57:19,440
level and knowledge in the attacker
right we want to know the skill set

985
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,930
K so what we had was is we head

986
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:27,940
if they were coming at us with Windows
nothing is Windows people but twenty

987
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,730
years ago specially

988
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:33,259
we put him in a low priority queue no
serious actor would be coming at you

989
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:34,329
with Windows

990
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:37,450
K these are all things we can do in our
fireworks

991
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:41,078
okay segmentation isolation what you do
here is

992
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:44,400
you put your services they're like
member that averell we called it is

993
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,480
Island am Alive

994
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,400
no we put your service in here so big
it's compromised

995
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,299
you can't go this direction is totally
untrusted nothing can go this way

996
00:57:54,299 --> 00:57:58,469
good those you can for your firewalls
before you configure it for what we call

997
00:57:58,469 --> 00:57:59,549
absorb

998
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:03,269
you only absorb the package you don't
respond you make it much harder on the

999
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:04,089
attack

1000
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:07,578
okay by imports inside the bastion host

1001
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:10,779
the box here the bastion host but all
the ports you need for the internal

1002
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:11,450
network

1003
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,859
invited inside I so we'll talk about
liver that

1004
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:19,410
smooth wall and base will walk nice free
when it's got a commercial 12

1005
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:23,140
when I love about this this is a default
installation a small wall

1006
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:28,118
this is inbound network traffic all I
did was install this box I love the

1007
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:31,509
ISO image what so out

1008
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:35,390
I nothing what cuz its im bout

1009
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:39,500
smoothwall those nobody should be coming
inbound unless you give them

1010
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,180
explicit permission to come im bout but
if you use to secure network

1011
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,078
architecture

1012
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:48,269
you don't have to give them anything
it's all in the other DMZ

1013
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:51,508
so by attacking this box there's nothing
nothing open

1014
00:58:51,509 --> 00:58:54,779
of 65535 border closed or

1015
00:58:54,779 --> 00:58:59,680
65,000 36 if count 0 this is what I said
things you have to start thinking about

1016
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,779
hey I'm sure how good a hacker is it the
boss doesn't have a port open

1017
00:59:02,779 --> 00:59:06,460
I can attack it was somebody physically
gets on orkut on something

1018
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,969
ok egress

1019
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:14,319
by default it binds all the porch your
users typically need

1020
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,469
for the internal network to go out to
the Internet right remote access all the

1021
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:19,140
time so

1022
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:23,519
they do that by default so just by stole
a small wallet default configuration

1023
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,939
you have solid ingress filtering and
egress filtering

1024
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,650
that you can actually even make it more
granular but by default it has a

1025
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,989
all set up are ready ready for you ready
to go K

1026
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:40,509
powerful things we can do okay so we're
not into

1027
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:43,640
what I want to show your is

1028
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,589
he met and so if I go in here

1029
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:52,549
last time I got left okay

1030
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:57,049
demos %uh tinsel spoo

1031
00:59:57,049 --> 01:00:00,920
that would do that ok

1032
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,410
what we're doing here is ms-13 00 night

1033
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:08,109
so I do is I take the latest and
greatest part abilities

1034
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:12,279
everado to see if I can explode all by
themselves flat

1035
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:15,269
cuz I tell people trade have been
testing if you can get out a flat

1036
01:00:15,269 --> 01:00:18,000
networking never going to get it to a
far lower filter

1037
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,769
right so I do here ms-13 Zara is earlier
and I'm

1038
01:00:21,769 --> 01:00:25,209
is I got a martyr parish al and I'm
gonna keep getting the user to click a

1039
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:25,849
link

1040
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:30,369
as users are you click art sort out
right now here is the explore decision

1041
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:32,150
see it's in an HTML

1042
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:36,509
so those who do exploitation is it 100
percent

1043
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:39,569
no that's why don't wanna try live am

1044
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:43,969
so will keep hittin it

1045
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:47,319
now goes Bay witter procession open

1046
01:00:47,319 --> 01:00:51,460
spawning the process to notepad migrated
it live because most people see notepad

1047
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,839
not gonna kill nope at

1048
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:56,660
so therefore exploit still go on and
there it is successfully migrated the

1049
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,529
process

1050
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:01,420
now this is brand new use after free
water body Internet Explore

1051
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:05,239
I'm sorta like to do is what I've tested
it saying I can do it

1052
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,440
I'm going to try to mitigate

1053
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,640
was at all I say we have help from
Microsoft

1054
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,900
he met up so let speed up your internet

1055
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,650
he met

1056
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:22,529
numbed up in hatches a plan after but
that's all right we've seen a lot

1057
01:01:22,529 --> 01:01:23,430
hackers

1058
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,989
so there's a net snow

1059
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:30,949
actually gonna turn on he met and when i
turn on the mat

1060
01:01:30,949 --> 01:01:34,769
we'll see if the attack works or doesn't
work I'm

1061
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:40,359
so I just go in i at find the execute a
book

1062
01:01:40,359 --> 01:01:47,140
and I just at it

1063
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:54,140
I me because I he's got the vote ability

1064
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:57,589
now I still got my sessions

1065
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:01,558
just to show you I added he met best
okay dinner at my session to hack the

1066
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:04,069
box and all that type of stuff because
it's after the fact

1067
01:02:04,069 --> 01:02:08,130
to any daddy in the in our hardening
configuration guidelines

1068
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:12,499
right I'm so now what I'm gonna do is

1069
01:02:12,499 --> 01:02:16,649
star traci again

1070
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,150
and seeing if I can

1071
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:26,200
compromised LCD

1072
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,348
the time to show any extra stuff here

1073
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:36,349
just showing you where it's protected
area there's my hashed out

1074
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:41,479
see my URL

1075
01:02:41,479 --> 01:02:47,729
I keep it my URL sending HTML so it it's
got some stuff

1076
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:54,729
what's happening here email stop a
Nicole

1077
01:02:56,589 --> 01:03:00,680
so no matter what I try to do try to
play a hacker dojo

1078
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,519
and all that type of stuff it
continually he met continues to stop it

1079
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,339
see that he met notify right there

1080
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:10,599
he met notify rock it continues to do it
it tries a

1081
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:14,019
heat spray shut it down I'm

1082
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:17,089
it tries a see how shut it out

1083
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:20,729
tries that such it shuts all these
exploitable

1084
01:03:20,729 --> 01:03:24,569
options down just by didn't take law

1085
01:03:24,569 --> 01:03:29,349
so what do you do you go into those
mission-critical a virus that UPS

1086
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:32,069
segment isolate and you put emailed on
their

1087
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:35,249
and you put these applications and know
that your users want to run

1088
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:38,578
that we really don't want to run but we
can say no

1089
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:42,779
member dabble right so so if we can say
no we have to run it

1090
01:03:42,779 --> 01:03:46,029
so don't matter I'll go stop them over
time it closed out

1091
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:50,029
but every time I try to get in there its
topical

1092
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:54,999
K if you have a news e-mail I highly
recommend you download and install it

1093
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:58,238
and it really does work Microsoft credit

1094
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:01,700
they got a SolidWorks it always do that

1095
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:06,939
okay I did their windows far all not
gonna do but that actually is

1096
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:10,640
eventos in map right takin map

1097
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:15,390
to run Windows Firewall runnin map wifi
adores advanced scanning techniques the

1098
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:16,558
actual if you need the

1099
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:21,579
command line let me know and see if it
works stops in coal

1100
01:04:21,579 --> 01:04:25,599
even a map the most popular open-source
candor cannot penetrate the latest

1101
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,999
version Windows Firewall

1102
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:32,509
give Microsoft credit they've gotten
better okay case study 2012 right 2012

1103
01:04:32,509 --> 01:04:33,049
Olympics

1104
01:04:33,049 --> 01:04:37,059
pretty powerful high profile bit think
hackers but one attack it

1105
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:42,749
we built an entire security operation
center for the advent head over six

1106
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:45,788
6600 incident tilt

1107
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:49,969
only six that ever made it to an
escalation purposes and never known to

1108
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:50,420
them

1109
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:54,719
were successful okay so defense does
work we can do it

1110
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:57,829
what about internal honeypots

1111
01:04:57,829 --> 01:05:01,569
there you go your mail where we know

1112
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:05,839
if it gets in have internal honey pot a
traffic to natural honey pot

1113
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,969
dead giveaway you've got nowhere in your
environment

1114
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:15,039
I'm breaking news for Microsoft black at
USA 2013

1115
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,569
contest a break he met they had it last
year within two days they had a new one

1116
01:05:19,569 --> 01:05:19,969
out

1117
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:23,719
but this year they're going really
really I no surprises

1118
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,349
a hundred thousand US dollars

1119
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:30,619
so if you think you can sit down on
their machine a break he met

1120
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:34,299
they'll pay you a hundred thousand
dollars if you can do it that

1121
01:05:34,299 --> 01:05:38,309
is a pretty good contest now that so

1122
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:45,309
any questions they got very a minute yes

1123
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,890
up

1124
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:56,150
renaming well the problem is most people
know if you rename it

1125
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:59,650
is still we like to call it the said
it's really the read the relative I D

1126
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:03,540
is 500 so is a lot of tools and stuff
like still pull all the accounts with

1127
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:04,420
that five hundred

1128
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:08,610
think so you can rename it it's one step
but hacker just has to know

1129
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:12,880
user to said said usual some cool little
tools for love for Timothy mollen and an

1130
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,170
egg actually folded a doubt

1131
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,730
but it is deterred that

1132
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:21,860
in Wales alright

1133
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:28,860
think about cool thank you thanks Kevin
