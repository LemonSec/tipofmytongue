1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,059
I'm from McAfee this is my first time

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,990
Shahrukh Khan and I we're really talking
more about real time instant response

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,480
and how we fit into that type of
discussion so

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,010
I'm I cells is here from seven of us I'm

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,600
I am the young kid almost every talk to
give a talk to everyone I say a

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,000
i'm new to this I believe in doing it.
for fifteen years

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,359
not the twenty five or thirty plus some
the others are out here so

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,480
when I can get an idea of where I'm
coming from why answers what's important

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,949
to me

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,079
I sort of the Navy doing it. at man

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,890
obscurity for ability left the military
after the nine and went to Microsoft

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,489
as a security analysts I I was the guy
sitting in the chair

13
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:47,559
just like everybody else audience
looking at what was going on

14
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,870
watching the Sam watching i ts trying to
find the events

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,190
and how what to do with them once I got
there after I left Microsoft they moved

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,050
over to you

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,370
sales maxi I really like Sam I like
instant response I want to

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,910
be able to give back to the kid
ecosystem in the industry and

19
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,270
move forward with it it's definitely
focusing on instant response

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,780
so that's that's why I wanted to come in
and give a talk about and send response

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,780
and kinda get a feel for where everybody
is in

22
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,119
how we do things you know I I think
through

23
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,490
Sam expecially that's my specialty love

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,809
you know it's a progression you know
everybody's looking at it from

25
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,900
up technology standpoint no

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,220
all I need the new tool I need the new
database a need to be able to get that

27
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,210
data faster

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,199
but it's not just the only factor we
have skills & and techniques

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,890
what we need to do you know I kinda grab
a snapshot a backpacker

30
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,240
in the early days we're all looking at
raw logs try line by line by line

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,070
that's not necessarily the best and
fastest way to get back to you

32
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,449
getting to the incident that we want to
solve I and I

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,000
I think through instant response is not
just one thing but it's an event

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,090
we wanna see what happened from

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,490
everywhere and be able to build a
picture and that way we can get to the

36
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,109
answer much much faster

37
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,780
with that in mind there's definitely a a
piece that I've been

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,810
discussing with customers I it it's a

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,370
a problem that I see going forward and
yet

40
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,660
the decisions over what's happening you
know in the early days

41
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,190
that evolution the early days it was the
CEO who ran the company

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,950
they made the decisions on what was
going to happen and what the direction

43
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,488
wise

44
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:37,080
and then they started hiring guys to
help them the CIO's

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
Ryan they're gonna man it's all the
information act guys gonna make the

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,599
decision and then

47
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,640
he needed help so he hired a CISO

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,599
and so the security information he's
going to manage that and it keeps

49
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,640
rolling down further and further and
further

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,929
and so we want to provide answer
responders because these are the people

51
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,200
actually making the decisions nowadays

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,060
they're the ones in not day you guys are
the ones making decisions when you see

53
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,930
those events in

54
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,790
in your security tools when you're
looking at this and when you look in

55
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,069
your eye

56
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,829
yes you're responsible for making that
decision now

57
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,610
and so we want to help everybody get to
a point where that decision becomes

58
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,290
again

59
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,129
faster easier more intelligent better
decide

60
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,329
and of course I have a a great picture

61
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,730
I remember sitting at my desk Microsoft
and I've got these

62
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,690
monitors in front I mean it felt like
nasa and I stopped and realize this I

63
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,989
I only have two eyes rite II don't need

64
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,129
you know 1620 monitor sitting in front
of me showing these graphs and charts

65
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:37,730
and everything else

66
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,190
and the information that's important and
that's why I really like to try and put

67
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,900
put across is its not about how much
information you have

68
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,519
it's about the the veracity in the
validity of the information you get

69
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,780
I see you need tools and technologies
that help

70
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,939
you get we want to be able to show you
what's important

71
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,280
when it's important and why it's
important and so I I thought through the

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,790
SF response process

73
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,298
you know what is it that we need I'm
sure everybody here knows the

74
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,650
the standard right it's the the
protected attacked

75
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,030
you know the respawn in the remediate
that's the life cycle over an incident

76
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,570
how do we where is all of this fit in
and so we

77
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,029
I think to the technology II of course
Sam

78
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,198
that's what I you so I think while
collection alerting

79
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,240
important component your locks rate it
used to be the person was looking at the

80
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,870
login

81
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,630
in the file and they knew that it was
from this device so that device and they

82
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,229
could figure out that this message

83
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,449
you know this was the source IP address
and then came destination and that sort

84
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:39,430
of thing

85
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,009
but as we get more logs and more data
coming out at us

86
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,410
we need the ability to have the
technology worked for us

87
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,070
and normalization is definitely a key
component there we want to be able to

88
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,300
to have that data show us what the
source IP addresses

89
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,620
and actually labeling source IP address
with you we don't need it

90
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,740
to be cryptic archaic and so

91
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,900
these are the types of things I think
when i think im think I've answer

92
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,570
response

93
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,889
these are the ones that really resonate
for me moving down the stock of course

94
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:12,820
after we've got our data it's been
normalized it looks good

95
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,139
we do it right you want to be able to
have it makes sense

96
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,229
and so correlation treating alarms

97
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,609
these are the types of things that you
need in your systems to to get help you

98
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,860
get out there

99
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,880
get get rid of all the junk be able to
show you what's really really important

100
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,300
so as we progress

101
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,199
again I thinking through the evolution
that the discussion technology

102
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,150
I like to ask the question right if you
had an alarm inside if your systems

103
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,570
how many people would let the system
decide to

104
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,639
firewall or block it right its it's a
its

105
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,000
will let the same do that right and
that's the progression or looking at

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,470
right cuz I don't see any hands going up
I

107
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,919
it's about that validity up the data

108
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,250
we want to be able to get to that point
where as we have these things happen

109
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,889
yes I trust the system enough I'm gonna
let it do that firewall block for me

110
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:14,110
when this alarm fires because it's the
fidelity is there

111
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,250
date in three directions so the sick

112
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,850
something I came up with lasting through
the answer response for this topic

113
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,520
and it's a direction that I see that
we're going in

114
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,299
is I C three directions because there's
there's what happened already

115
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,090
and that arson helps us with that it
pulls are logs and it creates our alarms

116
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,030
it tells us that something happened

117
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,169
and so I have that that's one the next
one is to then take that logic

118
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,030
what I've what i've seen and put that in
so that it'll find it again if it should

119
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,479
happen

120
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,699
that's the future and the same
technologies today they really do help

121
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,270
with that

122
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,359
the pass in the future we've got rules
we have alerts we have alarms

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,069
there's one piece that's still kinda
missing that's that middle piece

124
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,539
what's happening right now because the
same is gonna have to wait for the logs

125
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:02,599
to come in

126
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,860
we're gonna have to have the rules in
place have to wait for the log to get

127
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,889
correlated

128
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,949
but I thought that I could tell me
what's happening right now and that's

129
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:12,060
really where that real time network

130
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,180
in real time in point comes in and it
really is a technology change

131
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,560
because what we're looking at today
worst

132
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,949
yeah I should say what we're looking at
for yesterday

133
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:28,889
is an architecture with a central piece
and all of my and points

134
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,590
and when we think through the data and
how it gets there

135
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,659
it's about the endpoints talking to the
middle

136
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,949
and the endpoints talking to the middle
and then I go to the middle server the

137
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,270
database server

138
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,930
my console I look at that piece of
information that's their

139
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,650
but again it's that lack we have to wait
for every single wanna come in

140
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,210
and when we look at that it's a it's a
topic around

141
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,500
how do we change it how do we how do we

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,090
modify the technology so that it works
for us

143
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,448
and not against us and that's really

144
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:06,240
that real time peace i no wanna go out

145
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,250
not every in point but just the first
once

146
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,319
in the chain and i want to ask them the
question

147
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,660
who has this process running

148
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,720
you know bad dot XE and who has a
connecting to the internet right now

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,800
and so I'm gonna have that first host in
each chain

150
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,039
its gonna go out to Olive its friends
and its gonna ask that question

151
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,218
and then in the end I'll get an answer

152
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,620
and that's the shift that ICS making
that's where we're going to be able

153
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,510
to instead of asking a question database
and waiting for the database to give us

154
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,229
the answer

155
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm gonna ask a question of the host in
real time

156
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,720
who has this process running showing

157
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,620
we're seeing responses back 15 seconds

158
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,350
mean it it is unbelievable the abilities
were seeing moving forward in technology

159
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,920
today

160
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,990
and then that opens up more right so if
we think about

161
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:10,070
what's happening before and what what
might happen in the future with my rules

162
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,220
that's our the beginning of warrants a
response by

163
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,970
anyone knows who's been you know I
remember when configure hit

164
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,990
and it was all the sudden thousands of
machines were

165
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,690
were infected how did we know and how
are we gonna find what else in

166
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,380
or if I have the ability to go out my
hosts a who has this process running

167
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,450
right now

168
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,910
bring back that list and says I have
that list now that I know

169
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,130
go go to a process to stop I need in
action

170
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,430
take this action and go do it and so

171
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,239
against the evolution we have the raw
logs we looked at

172
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,450
we have Sam looking at logs force in
normalizing and parsing in creating

173
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,370
things

174
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,870
and now I have a razor that I can use to
go carve out my information

175
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,860
right now when I need it that's the the
real time direction that ICS moving

176
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,959
towards

177
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,219
of course when you think about it we
can't do it alone

178
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,380
should be very somewhere slide last
presentation

179
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,339
we need to be able to communicate with
everybody else in the industry

180
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:14,300
RightNow no one thing is going to be
able to to solve it all

181
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,689
because if it if it did well we all have
it nervous will be here and we'll

182
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,740
on the beach have to vacation because it
was all soft.

183
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,750
and so we look at it from a perspective
and and everybody should look at it from

184
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,690
a perspective

185
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,790
a death and being able to an angry

186
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,819
all over components together so that
it's a seamless platform for security

187
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,500
I'm looking at that platform of course

188
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,250
out want to be able to get the data from
me to the place is that it matters

189
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,320
I and it it's no longer just about the
the endpoint and the firewall

190
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,930
we can't we can't live in a world that
way anymore you know we have to think

191
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,609
about our data centers

192
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,100
you know what what technology do I have
to have their as opposed to the

193
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,930
technology have on the network wrongly
in point

194
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,160
right and again you'll notice it's all
the way getting all the way back down

195
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,910
that most important piece the real time
awareness

196
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,980
I need to have the information it's
important to me and get it back

197
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,290
that's it's a way that we're looking at
moving forward

198
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,870
and natural progression of course we
look at it

199
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,670
it's not always about one vendor we have
partners

200
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,849
it's not always about one technology
sometimes

201
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,220
we don't have what it takes and we need
more help

202
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,420
and so we look at it as a security
connected process we have people process

203
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,640
and technology where we won all work
together

204
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,449
and build a more cohesive story

205
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,470
for our problems an we talk before there
was a

206
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,790
talked earlier about sharing information
and being able to get that information

207
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,639
back and forth this is

208
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,750
more again ways that we're going to be
able to help

209
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,410
everyone be able to communicate better
and I i see that for myself

210
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,480
technologies I work with being able to
share details

211
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,690
local threatened told global threat
intelligence getting that information

212
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,820
back in force everybody

213
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,880
thats it's really what I C for its a
response and where we're going

214
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,630
today thank you everybody
