1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,540
going on satellites place to watch
movies I'm sooo hot movies but now I'm

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,548
like haha that's down

3
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:08,480
I'll I used to think that like
satellites are also

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,679
and I found a bunch of highway systems
on the Internet like

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,940
missus crap like modems I mean it's a
it's a all the

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,980
yet so I get you like I translate into
much packets Mac

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,070
thats unfortunate I'm hilariously your
firewalls and I are awesome

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,670
border perimeter security doesn't do a
lot of good if you take your backups and

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,050
put them directly on the internet with
the balkan angelos

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,739
this is like anass station in like a
Synology DiskStation

11
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:36,910
efficiently when I was little boxes that
got you can I cable come out of it let's

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,828
get it started discussing it with a
dinky little embedded Linux system

13
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,420
but does backups for you except you know
somebody put on the Internet directly

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,430
supposed to live on your lawn guys car
washes

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,989
who here knew that you could tell that
to a car wash but I didn't

16
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:53,199
um also hilariously

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,349
you can these things occur I know this
is a gagger what they have like an alarm

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,690
system built into them

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,030
where if there's a car in there and you
think there's like a click go now

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,330
I'm being ordered to drink I like that's
good

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,789
shares or

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,549
are look while as good

23
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:19,750
I but these things I'll you have an
alarm over you can

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,890
you can flip the Rams up a trap the car
inside

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,259
and then a little a little are like I
was on a little thing place so like you

26
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:29,579
can send your friend through me like I
watched this MOU

27
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,360
what's the rage trying to the car all
the for spring stuff

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,039
yeah they've run when you see he like
these things I guess we come in a giant

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,619
box

30
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:41,840
or like some some company comes and
installs it for you if you're like a

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,909
the owner of the car wash but like they
put a little panel on the wall like in

32
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:48,790
the back room and you can control the
water pressure you can turn on a soul

33
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,119
when you can do all this sort of stuff

34
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,780
the pair was what's vulnerable right the
panel gets an IP address is running

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,490
Windows CE

36
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,839
and you can FTP to it and you can get a
commit like a C prompt

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,469
never have a seafront a car wash um

38
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:07,079
this was interesting it's just a
gigantic steam generator like the size

39
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,649
of those levers like this you'd like

40
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,930
twice like like two refrigerators wide
it makes

41
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,550
steam and I thought permanently why is
our interest I want the

42
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,390
I want to think that this is more
interesting but it just makes people

43
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,660
like

44
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,150
one we care about paper well then you
see things in hospitals and laboratories

45
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,920
and things

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,329
you really really want to make everyone
on the burn were really angry you turn

47
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:28,870
off them

48
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,709
the humidor fire all boy get about
people to burn were dry crispy skin

49
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,800
how um

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,629
also other marketing material goes over
how

51
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,379
you can connect directly to the board am
thinking to myself wow these guys that

52
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,459
have no idea what they're telling me
like

53
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,050
I'm old-boy the market but you're also
says that there in a lot of very person

54
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,840
just places including the White House

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,560
like so you connect directly to the
board

56
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,870
in the white house right now I'm down
that's going up to my little book

57
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,519
guy um emergency telco equipment up

58
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,940
visa first responders have to do you
would like this is a VoIP system

59
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,310
but you can install like a local 911 a

60
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,220
facility or if you wanna like
overflowing on one facility like

61
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,940
you gonna plan something and you're like
well or any like

62
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,500
two hundred more people answering 911
for tomorrow because we accordions

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,470
real fun they're gonna love I'll so yet
actually sings in a bolt-on

64
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,120
extra flight capacity basically well
they look like this

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,090
and there's no credits and they monitor
don't monitor calls per se but you have

66
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,459
all the columns all that stuff but

67
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,980
prism says that they're catching right
although matter of like

68
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,220
who called what number when and for how
long

69
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,220
that at these things do I and

70
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,799
the Act there on the internet with no
credit so anybody that

71
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,290
has a web browser can process think and
looking reblogged

72
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,989
on are you as a secondary this this came
off %uh

73
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,489
I when i think is a switch very old
switch I'll

74
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,470
anybody wanna yelling point cuz I did
when I saw this I

75
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,670
actually had to stand up to gallon point
I need a running start

76
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,849
support for netscape sis netscape 6 10th
of August

77
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,820
2001 February 1998 fix initialization
fighting problem with netscape

78
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,190
script found in dub dub dub by Geo
cities dot com dot oh my god

79
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,770
there's code from geo city is running on
switching equipment on the internet live

80
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,310
right now

81
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,620
hi

82
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,080
speakers I didn't think that the people
would decide that putting a web server

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,070
inside speakers would be a good idea

84
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:45,199
yes you can make them play shit um these
things have like there for like a surfer

85
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,509
stages or lobbies or something and you
can put like it's kinda like hold music

86
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,850
but yeah if you want like intermediary
like all this band just got off stage in

87
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,729
a new band just got on stage

88
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:59,190
arm you can make a play things and yes
im just

89
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,250
authenticated just post mp3 and you're
good to go

90
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,680
some random speakers and was blaring
troll or Rick Astley

91
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,770
up any place that's big enough to have a
cooler labeled specifically for

92
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,889
champagne

93
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,949
you think maybe there's some dollars
there these guys have a champagne alarm

94
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,430
interesting as gonna call this another
Niagara system

95
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,740
um this is the layout of their system

96
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,120
this is a large hotel in New York I
forget the name was actually blanked out

97
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,840
so I don't get anybody in trouble

98
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,119
but the in the bottom left there you can
see the champagne temperature

99
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,300
originally I thought that to those were
sensors that we're both temperature

100
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,610
sensors in the whole thing was

101
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,150
holy crap this this fridges is big
enough to have to

102
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,500
temperature sensors in different zones
how much campaign and they possibly have

103
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,039
um but still you know if you have a
champagne cooler it just for champagne

104
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,900
a you're really gonna make somebody some
procurement person's day bad when you

105
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,000
raise that temperature to 150 height of
champagne explode

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,979
I'll may ask our funny like same thing
on the Internet at your hotel

107
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,539
this is the funny part is get this is
Rick its hollywood because then you

108
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:05,719
could go to the hotel

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,800
and sit in the hotel and a mess with the
hotel while you're in and watch them

110
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,580
later on

111
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,430
you know it depends on how how how much
of a sociopath ya right

112
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,440
um science we love science who doesn't
love science get

113
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,810
well Scouts earn actually I had like 400
something ridiculous findings that sir

114
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,130
like at some point I decided that that

115
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,539
I can't do all this by hand and I had
written by just kept to myself

116
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:33,009
and I had a friend up a help me write a
budget stuff as well

117
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,220
and I have discovered a lot of a lot of
things very short period of time

118
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,060
bike by looking for specific I'll
business organizations

119
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,430
and I this search warrant for certain I
found lots and pages pages stuff

120
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,560
so we're at the screen trying to auto
show you later but like certain had

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,199
a ridiculous amount of stuff online like
this particular screenshot was a

122
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,400
functional test monitoring page in this
is like

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,659
for people that write code that submit
jobs two giant work

124
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,110
clusters do things this is the
measurement of how those jobs performing

125
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,509
other clusters do

126
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,860
not entirely interesting anybody that's
like contextually disassociated from

127
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,509
surn

128
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,190
but my first guess is like a security
dude is probably shouldn't be all

129
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,160
morning

130
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,090
um neither should held up by user
geography

131
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,099
like their health app system was
connected to the Internet query a

132
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,940
beloved over the Internet really a

133
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,120
coiled up system anonymous byline holy
crap

134
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,870
um this is a map I love a system they
have called Alice

135
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,800
that reports the compute nodes they have

136
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,050
by cluster by geography and how busy
they are how many jobs the right

137
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,069
so like this scales alright something
else but

138
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:44,840
this is I was a better mapping this
later but like generally speaking I

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,349
should be able to go to a website and
look at the start of your entire

140
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:49,669
computer cluster

141
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,909
this is their core network um

142
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,259
this is a wiki that they had running
this is all a corner working on it

143
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,729
generally speaking you probably know
what your core network documentation

144
00:07:58,729 --> 00:07:59,859
exposed to

145
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,360
the general internet I'll this is their
virtual

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,500
compute cluster where you can ask for
yep wanna be a mixer

147
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,680
um this is a screenshot from the Google
earth

148
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,060
application that they built that was
just like

149
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,560
this acceptance of our pretty at the
graphs

150
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,759
their our computer closers who they're
connected to and what what where the

151
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,620
route to go

152
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,050
how busy the how busy the nodes are and
how

153
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,400
II how popular they are or how I am

154
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,169
how much power they can consume based on
their side so you can see like transfer

155
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,809
rate we're transferring it a point six
gig a second across all systems running

156
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,779
244,000 jobs in like this is a pretty
big compute cluster that's completely

157
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,240
open to me to mess with

158
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,260
arm I reported that they have their own
I S C sir Department together own

159
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,010
computer is in response

160
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,149
a team and reported to them and like

161
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,060
9/10/12 to reporters now offline so we
got awesome circle people

162
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,089
arm I went on to find 'em

163
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,950
gondolas this is a French Guiana a
system that's a

164
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,480
a ski resort and yes you can stop it in
the middle love

165
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,920
the ride and then you can open the doors
and then you can yell at them over the

166
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,010
speaker

167
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,319
a full I haven't tried that but

168
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,110
i'm inferring it based entirely on
having to go on manually translate all

169
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,070
this text

170
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,190
grassings ordeal and it's got like like

171
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,350
summer mode in winter mode and right now
it's in winter mode

172
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,620
would be kinda funny to switch it to
some see what happens what's which it

173
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,880
may just watch the news and see if
anything comes up

174
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,779
own gigantic ridiculous solar arrays
that track the Sun

175
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,779
the system with the used to calculate
the track in the Sun

176
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,540
looks like now it's called Alice I looks
like that

177
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,860
well whoever writes a javascript I did
them a favor because it was so bad

178
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,940
that's the JavaScript was causing the
page to not be able to render properly

179
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,620
took me like a day just to get it to do
this

180
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,450
um it is so bad you can't act this just
because you can't even read it

181
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,480
like it's it's you great I found the
setup

182
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,450
section at it the I give up

183
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,100
it was cool for Riley about I think this
is this guy think this is a screenshot

184
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,190
the power consumption from those systems
but I could be wrong

185
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,800
this is a a I think it's either Greece
or Italy

186
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,849
it's a it's another a solar electric
generation plant thats

187
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,420
generated 350 kilowatt hours of power
just

188
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,769
not a small amount of power your heart
monitor

189
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,350
why is our heart monitor connected to
the Internet somebody tell me please

190
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,950
every here were kept before ever any
other people

191
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,260
your hair is on fire yet like

192
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,260
I should be able to look at heart
monitors over the internet with no

193
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,120
credit

194
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,490
like you click on the thing that popped
RTP session and does this

195
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,529
oh and and there is a there is an
authentication box

196
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,550
but I'm I just drag of the screen

197
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,810
like the the authentication box comes up
over this

198
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,699
interface I mean I don't think I'm
certain this is read-only covering think

199
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,450
that you can write

200
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,519
to somebody's heart wannabes but that
would be a whole different like

201
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,930
oh man I'll housing

202
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,040
housing control a where you can IOC

203
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,760
turn a light on and off a house on a
mission sorry this thing online same

204
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,269
thing

205
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,880
ok Reds you can open skies garage door
making really scared

206
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,160
um dot government seizes the fun ones
anybody familiar with a 4.92 hurt

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,529
spectrum at all

208
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,260
um recently a the Department I think
it's

209
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,970
DHS decided we don't want to deal with
so we on wall unwashed masses

210
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,800
masses and all other silly wifi games
we're gonna create our own frequency

211
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,439
but we're gonna use all the same exact
hardware and technology we're just gonna

212
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,269
like

213
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,310
jump down a few hundred megahertz serve

214
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,880
5.1 or 5.0 cigarettes are now offer .9

215
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,100
nobody can talk to us because we're
running 4.9

216
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,050
I'll they look like this basically there
are buildings and roads and things like

217
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,670
that

218
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,279
I here's you can buy them directly from
the site I think they make

219
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,810
check your ideas here actually dug up is
technically only dug up the force was to

220
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,989
have this kind of hardware

221
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,269
but pub the site you can buy from the
public

222
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,589
on his overview that's I worried you
would basically says

223
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,600
home I securities using for 490 hurts
wireless transmissions right okay cool

224
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,450
well the listening on S&P and a

225
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:24,060
public at dash S&P walked Ashley 1-up
public can you get this

226
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,880
and a little string that I blurted out
was the persons name who runs them

227
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,470
and based on a name you can google that
name and find out what office she works

228
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,290
in what building she's in her phone
number in her email address

229
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,939
so like they're super seeker awesome
hardware to keep all the super secret

230
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,820
stuff super-secret

231
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,880
is public on the internet and doing
information disclosure

232
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,760
both arm

233
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,089
I never ever thought that I would find
lobsters on the Internet this this was a

234
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:50,160
thing to me

235
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,500
well

236
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,860
this is a fishery but using a skater
reversible SCADA

237
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,920
stuff to control the coolers at the
years and I've actually used to keep

238
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,250
their fish

239
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,279
me know prepared before the selfish and
they have a lobster chill

240
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,769
room so I mean your status right

241
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,480
yep but it's chill mode right we can
forget the champagne cooler

242
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,600
so like this is getting absurd

243
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,079
sewing force anybody thought we gonna
get a pursuing for the internet

244
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,359
I didn't think that you could put a
swimming pool on an epic km

245
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,130
and what the fuck is that

246
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,620
what are you kidding me what's

247
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,710
why would you give me access to a as a
part of me why

248
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,950
you can set it to manual

249
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:46,950
and then you can just dump it into the
pool okay

250
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,270
so I an ass a pup if you if you know a
friend that's running this

251
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,540
system Tom just take it off you know on
plug it makeup on

252
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,579
so like an ass about

253
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,840
really so

254
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,570
consider the following you're in your
80s style horror flick scenario with a

255
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,260
bunch of hot teenagers in a pool

256
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,740
you're not even talking before ok om

257
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,070
when Jason Voorhees shows up right
addition voorhees likes is

258
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,840
victim's life but unfortunately because
you dumped the acid into the pool

259
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,400
they are now all soup and now he's
pissed you

260
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,490
good so disclosures were he's is
something that you

261
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,780
you probably want to avoid so please
don't dump acid into the pool

262
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,910
how much like jacques to

263
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,240
drastically change direction the the
system that connects a gigantic cameras

264
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,390
that the news uses

265
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,740
to the van I think it's to the van is
public

266
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,260
on the Internet it looks like this and
you can mess with it no

267
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,220
I have no idea what it does because no
matter what you click and do you get no

268
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,790
Feedback

269
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,910
so maybe somewhere somewhere there's a
new senator tearing their hair out over

270
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,939
and try to figure out what the hell's
going on but like

271
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,010
stuff online do yet own prism you

272
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,069
everything those gigantic LED billboards
that are

273
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,980
home on the side freeways well this with
the interface looks like

274
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,200
they listen on port 80 with no credit
any kind on

275
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,400
this is how you can find one on Street
View

276
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,640
this is what they look like highway at
the camera

277
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,760
in pencil the camera looks like

278
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,150
okay put I cackle like it's really
clever but no

279
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,579
this runs on that require that runs up
already

280
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,500
this runs on port 8088 so like this with
every child and again there's no credit

281
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,110
just point whereas at it goes

282
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,210
um so that's the added playing

283
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,430
on that slide I were very nearly I think
they may have updated their marketing

284
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,979
campaign

285
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,770
but interesting you can control
billboards on it

286
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,569
um so it's a finder stuff you know your

287
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,620
you find year internet adventure of a
love goodies and you have like fifty

288
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,860
thousand results would you do

289
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,190
how do you parse fifty thousand results
when you do when you have all this stuff

290
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,090
how do you find it

291
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,350
we screenshot it it's a lot easier to
look at 3.2 stuff

292
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,380
that is to look at are

293
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,800
individual pages and render every single
page and on about 50,000 pages by and

294
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,449
the two-part

295
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,850
um so weird thing its range of something
so the screen just might look familiar

296
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,240
um so I won't help

297
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,000
I here's the public my friend Paul
basically wrote majority of it obvious

298
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,110
which provided guidance

299
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,550
I but you can dollars now and you can
point in a showdown and you could you

300
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,199
clear reason it will take pictures of
the stuff

301
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,860
fight and you can hyper-threading her
have it or you can set up like twent 20

302
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,800
50 100 threads

303
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,240
and you go and you end up with a giant
directory for love

304
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,860
for images for some the other stuff I i
basically

305
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,910
scripted that with VNC I if you have
default creds for example

306
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,069
and you have a budget places that are
running DNC you can

307
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,860
use this to hear and literally just
write a for loop in bash to step through

308
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,880
a list of IP addresses connect to the
VNC

309
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,410
session at take a screenshot a
disconnect completely read-only

310
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,540
on so that I got a lot on your screen
just there was just like

311
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,709
grabbing screenshots from from I'm
pretty mager systems

312
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,780
if you want to be a little more devious
you can take that

313
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,000
output from near Python scripts or the
output from the API and pipe and

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,190
directly to Metasploit

315
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,250
in this particular example this is a
screenshot

316
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,930
love doing a net by a scandal every
night by of

317
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,150
computer that I was able to find in
China and a

318
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,300
hilariously net buyers tells you a lot
more about the computer than its owner

319
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,139
would probably

320
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,840
like you have like how many interfaces
it has and what their mac Address is our

321
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,580
and in some cases with the name of the
user that log in the boxes so

322
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,730
don't let the buyer such the Internet
because people can just

323
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,260
look and it'll tell them when they ask
I'll

324
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,270
to the best defense is a good offense
right a anybody work in an environment

325
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,010
where under penalty of death if you're
in an app on your own equipment your own

326
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,820
infrastructure they'll take you out to
the parking lot

327
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,330
and beat you to death with a tire iron I
work at a bar to those places

328
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,689
right so if you can scan yourself with
the

329
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,620
but the attackers can scan it can scan
you then obviously attackers have a

330
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,840
better idea of your attack service that
you do

331
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,209
and I put you in a very bad position
short has already done the scams

332
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,660
