1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:17,990
turbo talk during lunch today presented
by fire I my name is Alexis sculpt a

2
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,799
consulting systems engineer for the west
and we're gonna go over to the state of

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,470
the landscape and what fire I kind of
doesn't provides a service to all of us

4
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:37,170
so

5
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,379
liar I approach is an adaptive defense
model and it starts with something that

6
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:45,979
you're all very familiar with which is
general technology right so we all have

7
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:53,210
technology trying to detect trying to
alert you are technology of fire I can

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,100
detect both known and unknown threats so
it's not a signature-based technology it

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,409
covers all vectors of entries so we talk
about vectors that would be ways that

10
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:08,600
Mauer gets in the organization's web
email data center's web servers mobile

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:17,649
devices USB stick in the parking lot our
technology is founded over 10 years ago

12
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:22,789
its patented it's a hardened hypervisor
that we built from the ground up and

13
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:27,899
it's designed around security and
nothing else so I'll go and more into

14
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:31,940
that technology in a moment but it's
really kind of like a three tier idea

15
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:38,500
that fire has an approaching today's
cyber security issues and landscape that

16
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,130
technology is its itself there
collecting information it feeds into an

17
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,729
intelligence data bank and that
intelligence data bank is basically

18
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:51,200
we're looking at roughly fifty billion
objects every day and I don't just mean

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,429
files it could be events in a sim it
could be behavior that we see what we're

20
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:03,130
doing what we call incident response
post breach work we're in the front line

21
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,380
of most of the incidents that you've
read about in the news so without

22
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,140
disclosing anything but any of our
customers you can certainly you probably

23
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,208
know fiery response to most of the major
breaches out there and that also feeds

24
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,530
into this intelligence databank we've
got over a million network censors out

25
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,930
there were deployed on millions of
different endpoints as well

26
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:33,790
hundreds of malware analysts and until
experts and we've discovered twenty of

27
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,429
the last 30 0 days that are actively
exploited no other security vendor out

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,620
there actually can claim any statistic
like that the third silo of what we kind

29
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,590
of do it fire I is the expertise so if
you feel like you might have some

30
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,980
thing in the network and you're not sure
fire I is the kind of company that can

31
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,069
come in do an assessment to see if your
compromise if you're in a specific

32
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:05,069
vertical let's say its banking and you
read online that a certain bank has

33
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,950
become compromised you want to know if
you have what they have you can contact

34
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,540
us that's one of the things that we do
as far as our experts will also do

35
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,010
incident response as well so if you
already know that you are compromising

36
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,220
you can't get it out of the network on
your own fire Isaac go to for that as

37
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,010
well

38
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,929
the ex expertise that we have the the
responders they also feed into this

39
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,400
intelligence database in this
intelligence database on an hourly basis

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,549
fees and all the products all the
endpoints all the network censors the

41
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,629
email sensors all of that so it's a
continuous circle of intellectual

42
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:44,548
sharing and crowdsourcing what's really
important when we're talking about the

43
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:50,090
technology that fire has understanding
the attack from beginning to end the

44
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,760
full kill chain today's attacks start
with an exploit typically it's not

45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,480
normally just a file sometimes it is if
it's an attachment via email but it's

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,170
it's an exploit it something that can't
be patched that the the vendor of a

47
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,328
software products has a bug that a
hacker has discovered and they're

48
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,980
utilizing that bug to get into the
network and it cannot be patched it's

49
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:20,010
not because you didn't apply the latest
TV we have tremendous exploit detection

50
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,960
so that's really kind of how we found
most of those euro days is detecting

51
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,409
that exploit if you do not detect the
exploit the rest of the skill chain

52
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,870
that's on the board right now so from
exploit call back now we're binaries

53
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,380
coming down or mail code coming down

54
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,880
maintaining persistence in the network
and then in a worst-case scenario the

55
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,330
data going out the door the did it
tration if you don't see the exploit the

56
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,760
rest of it can be completely office
created an encrypted in an unseen so

57
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,250
it's it's crucial that you see the thief
when they walk in the door if you don't

58
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,450
see that coming in the door then you're
typically don't see the data going out

59
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,009
the door so

60
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,539
so how does this technology works so
it's we have something we've built an

61
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:10,639
MDX multi vector virtual execution
environment and what it is it's our own

62
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,800
virtual environment again its
purpose-built for security doesn't do

63
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,189
anything else except look for malware
look for malicious behavior malicious

64
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:26,039
intent it so hard and hypervisor so you
know absolutely hackers are going to try

65
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,748
to see if they're sitting in a sandbox
absolutely I bring up a V em right now

66
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:36,490
with VMware and I throw a PDF it came in
my span and open it up in there there's

67
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,229
a good chance has nothing to do with it
because it's gonna check the services

68
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,199
gonna look for certain services running
processes running it might check for

69
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,460
system time moving forward

70
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,229
certain log files being incremented
we've built in anti evasion techniques

71
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,020
over three hundred and this hypervisor
this hypervisors over 10 years old so

72
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,209
this is not something that we just
created actually first to market with

73
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:01,860
the idea of virtualizing not only
objects when you open them up in an

74
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,689
environment like this but all packet
workflows I'll give you really good

75
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:10,740
example you go to cnn.com there's ad
space that ad space is what contains the

76
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,229
exploit not cnn.com we're not looking at
one URL we're looking at a hundred

77
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,258
different URLs that are being rendered
and replicating that across multiple

78
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,759
operating systems with multiple versions
of Java Adobe whatever / whenever it's

79
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,909
exploding again that's how we find both
feet the known and the unknown threats

80
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:36,800
and we cover all the vectors so if your
Android device gets compromised and they

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,789
steal all your contacts and they also
steal some of the email that you had

82
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:45,459
with those contacts they can specially
tailored Spearfish email now let's say

83
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,330
your son or daughter's in a sports
program in the center the sports

84
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,699
schedule looks like it's from the
co-chairman open it up as you trust it

85
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:56,509
that's a real Spearfish that's actually
something that has happened so we

86
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,439
correlate all the vectors as well it's
not just hey you've got something on

87
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,519
this machine that's bad it's it came
from here it spread laterally there and

88
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,839
and correlating that whole thing so you
can see the full killed chain of what's

89
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,510
happening in your organization

90
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,140
it's also built for high performance and
efficacy so we can bring up hundreds of

91
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:22,469
GM's in a single moment in time and
replicate your it's your packets across

92
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,550
those at the same moment time of 4
minutes or less determine whether

93
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,750
something is malicious and the really
cool thing about this technology isn't

94
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,210
just determining that it's bad I mean
sure hits bed what we want to know is

95
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,599
what the callback communications gonna
be when this thing is done in its

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,480
compromise the system is it gonna go
lateral is it gonna try to set up a

97
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,680
proxy internally and when it's taken
data out the door

98
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,060
let's say it's a keylogger something
very simple where's it gonna send that

99
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,200
data so in at that that's a moment we
actually push the clock forward in time

100
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,780
whether it needs to be ours weeks months
it doesn't matter in this virtual

101
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,700
environment for minutes your real time
will determine that it's malicious

102
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,680
determine what it wants to do its
behavior forensics and also determine

103
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,030
what the callback is once you have the
callback you can share that information

104
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,820
through syslog-ng with other devices
that you have the network where you can

105
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,840
put the fire on line to block it so if I
but FIFA comes in my house takes my TV

106
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,710
takes all the cool stuff that I've got
my drone whatever if they can't get out

107
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:32,130
of my house I never had anything stolen
so we're looking at about 2 million

108
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:38,010
objects per hour across network email
mobile file systems data centers and

109
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,650
we're popping those into this and the ex
detonation chamber and that's where

110
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,610
we're discovering the zero-day exploits
that we discover that's also where we're

111
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,420
generating that command and control
information before it actually happens

112
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,069
in real time that's how are able to
actually prevent the reach from being

113
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,110
successful again we're going to
correlate that across everything that

114
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,570
you've got so if it started with an
Android device and then made it to your

115
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,470
email on whatever device you have in the
office but then went out the door on

116
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,510
somebody else's device really cool thing
that we published last month was we

117
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,920
found a hacker actually posting the data
that they wanted to actual trade on

118
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,610
Microsoft TechNet

119
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,310
that's something that all your web
filters allowing right now

120
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,989
communication and post Microsoft TechNet
it was just gibberish and the hacker

121
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,390
picked up that gibberish deleted the
post and put it back together and how

122
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,720
their data so it's not going out the
door necessarily over UDP not going out

123
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,640
the door

124
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,360
the way that you might think it can go
out the door in various different

125
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,070
methods and learning about those methods
in the detonation chamber the MDX is is

126
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,279
pretty much crucial house fire has
gotten most of the brand recognition

127
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,709
that you know as far as far as your
deduction that's the technology piece

128
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,969
but also had up you know the three
pieces technology intelligence and

129
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,980
expertise let's talk about it threat
intelligence what exactly is that is

130
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,930
that I O Si use what's a piece of it
indicators are compromised indicators of

131
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,870
compromise could be a demand could be an
IP but that's that's all signature-based

132
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,320
stuff right once you learn that once you
share that with everybody and everybody

133
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,000
knows that the hackers not going to use
that stuff anymore we're gonna do

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,730
something new what we consider threat
intelligence is actually knowing who's

135
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,920
knocking on the door what kind of FIFA's
coming in the house are they sponsored

136
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,240
by a nation state is it regional is it
something that only one state or

137
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,250
location or county is seeing is it
something that is specifically targeting

138
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,130
a specific vector like financial
healthcare retail this year's the year

139
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,449
the healthcare hack right you've heard
that the news you seen at the news they

140
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:51,319
have to go public with her hacked last
year was the year of the retail hack so

141
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,220
these things change the more fires money
being made and so whenever there's money

142
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,670
being made right actors will will pursue
whatever the lowest hanging fruit news

143
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,490
we've basically got a huge intelligence
database on the tools techniques and

144
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,180
procedures that today's hackers use that
gives us a very unique ability to come

145
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,979
into your network in asset so if you
have something and also be able to

146
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:23,640
create products and technology to detect
it prevented

147
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,740
so traditional defenses have always been
what what file is bed what Andy five

148
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,330
signatures beds my desktop GV can block
it what URL is bad that I want my

149
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,660
employees going to this fishing site
it's always about what

150
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,709
when it really it's about who you want
to know who's coming in the door so you

151
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,680
know what they're trying to steal so
there who lead you to the what there's a

152
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,810
person behind this keyboard this isn't
just some random thing that happens

153
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,170
because you opened up a spam email these
are highly customized highly tailored

154
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,280
attacks and they're specifically
targeted when they when they decide to

155
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,449
send a piece of code out that they went
through the painful process of figuring

156
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,270
out what the exploit is they're not
going to send to everybody they're going

157
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,689
to tailor it targeted so that its
successful at stealthy and it goes

158
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:19,180
undetected by other security vendors
user well-funded nation state actors so

159
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,349
the government of China has a building
we came out with a report called the apt

160
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,280
one report your welcome to find on our
site they have a building and they have

161
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,240
no government employees they come in on
a day-to-day basis and hack one of the

162
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,730
interesting statistics that you can get
from something called the AM trends

163
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,610
report which you can find a copy of a
takeaway can get an electronic foresight

164
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,660
Chinese New Years a great time to do
change request controls in your network

165
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,740
because that's the least amount of
activity that we see from our where

166
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:57,600
they're all on vacation all of them but
not the russians there's still some out

167
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,820
there but China takes a nap during
Chinese New Year their relentless when I

168
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,730
mean relentless even if you have fire I
come in and get them out you better but

169
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,700
they're coming back you know if I'm a
thief and I'm in your house and I'm in

170
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,520
your house for six months or more I know
everything that you do I know on Friday

171
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,939
at three o'clock is when you accept all
your LinkedIn ads I know what sites you

172
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,610
shop at I know who you email the most I
know what time you come in I know what

173
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,470
time you take lunch I know everything
about you your low hanging fruit now

174
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,570
that I have all this data I'm not going
to go when she kicked me out go try

175
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,460
something else I'm gonna try to get back
in the same way that I do

176
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:44,870
the first place so the intelligence and
expertise come back to that again we're

177
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,350
looking at about fifty billion things
per day of the ring up fifty billion

178
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,650
virtual environments per day were
emulating for web flows opening up

179
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,900
attachments in email clicking links in
email for you and on average in the

180
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,470
statistic continues to grow so and I
apologize it's really hard to keep these

181
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,570
slides up to date because they changed
the frequently these statistics we find

182
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:13,580
over 400,000 unique pieces of malware
everyday that are only seen once so any

183
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,610
sort of endpoint that you're using that
signature-based any sort of traditional

184
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,070
security that you've been told me know
through PCI compliance and HIPAA

185
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,910
compliance to buy is pretty much
rendered useless because you're not

186
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,910
going to see it more than once they can
go ahead criticized mature and they can

187
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:34,569
update it but that piece of code that
bad site that's not going to be seen

188
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,820
again but domain that the user
command-and-control that's not going to

189
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,380
exist anymore

190
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,490
on the expertise side last year we
delivered over a hundred thousand hours

191
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,600
of incident response that's a lot that's
a lot of information that we've gathered

192
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,920
by going into organizations that are
compromised either publicly or privately

193
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,479
don't know half of the ones are probably
85 percent of the compromises you're not

194
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,860
even aware of going in there and
figuring out what the tools and

195
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,300
techniques and procedures of these
families are we also look at about one

196
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,959
billion events per day so we have a
security system we have other things

197
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,400
that are looking at events those could
be events from our products is to be

198
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,310
events from our incident response or
assessments could be events from your

199
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:29,780
Sims again we discovered twenty of the
last 30 actively exploited 0 days is a

200
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,410
lot of CV's read everyday somebody else
finds a common vulnerability this isn't

201
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,980
that I mean these do become CV's when we
discover them but this is basically

202
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,210
something that nobody else can can say
and what an interesting statistic on

203
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,070
this 20 out of 30 eighteen of those
twenty were found by our products that

204
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,470
MDX technology I just discussed this is
about two and a half years worth of 0

205
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,500
days were telling here all found by the
MDX eighteen of those twenty so that's

206
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,690
phenomenal that's not a bunch of people
in a room looking at code that's a

207
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:09,290
product generating an alert that is on
something that it's never been seen

208
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,089
before in determining through the
behavior of that code or that exploit

209
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,960
that its malicious in determining what
that community control is the other two

210
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,290
that we found was through something
called fire as a service where we goin

211
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,150
in with your network on a regular basis
just to make sure everything is safe

212
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,189
let's talk about email versus web this
is a statistic I got from the

213
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,550
intelligence team it's pretty recent
however we did find another zero day

214
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:41,650
since I got this data this is about
thirty days old so minus the most recent

215
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:47,939
02 that we discovered which is called
clandestine wharf 10 in the last 20 days

216
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,510
seven of them came thru drive-by
download that CNN example I gave you its

217
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,290
ad space you just landing on a page in
your getting infected three of them used

218
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,060
email is an injury vector leave it or
not your employees your company are

219
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:08,589
going to open the attachment we just
need to accept that as fact it can be

220
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,780
the Spearfish I described about the
coach emailing you about your kids

221
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:17,810
soccer event it could be a purchase
order to the PIO or better yet it could

222
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:22,190
be something from FedEx I've never had
FedEx proactively contact me via email

223
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,910
but they're gonna open it because it's a
gift for them and it might even have a

224
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,220
password in it to keep it safe so all
the things you might even have

225
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,680
misspellings I mean people are going to
open it you're gonna have a tradition in

226
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,600
your organization you can train them to
your blue in the face but you're gonna

227
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,409
have new hires exiting employees and
you're always going to have this vector

228
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,900
of human error out of those 10 also
seven of them can be directly correlated

229
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,820
to nation state sponsored attacks some
talk about the Russian government Syrian

230
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,129
electronic army really I'm talking about
China but I don't want to be done

231
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:06,430
too much we follow about five hundred
different thread actor families that

232
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:13,610
could be from 1 hacktivists an anonymous
to the statement nations to China about

233
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,780
50 of them cause the most problems for
everybody

234
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,810
fourteen of the ones that will most
recently research does about 30 days ago

235
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,740
they're still using spearfishing as a
main vector of injuries or five of them

236
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,410
you spearfishing eight again drive-by
downloads that's just average everyday

237
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,920
surfing and one of them actually use
both techniques now that's interesting

238
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,160
that's where I sent you a link in an
email and you click on it and you get

239
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,980
infected so that's also something we're
not supposed to be doing but we still do

240
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,240
that another statistic I got from
intelligence humor I thought you would

241
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,440
find interesting is that lateral
movement does not mean malware so if my

242
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,330
machine gets infected because I had a
drive-by opened up the email from FedEx

243
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,590
however it got infected it's not going
to call command-and-control necessarily

244
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,909
from my machine it's gonna try to go to
every other machine in the organization

245
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:17,500
and how it does that is not by pushing
an executable across the line

246
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,160
member I said there's a human behind the
keyboard so they can actually infected

247
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,390
machine and take ownership of it without
actually having an executable they just

248
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:34,530
elevate their permissions and move
lateral so about 48% of the machines

249
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,620
that we worked on last year that were
compromised you know out of either

250
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,489
incident response for compromise
assessments actually don't have any file

251
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,640
that you could delete say this is the
bed filed as the File menu to make a

252
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,350
signature for make sure it's not the
network kind of a scary thing right

253
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,120
because everybody's moving towards end
points and and trying to figure out

254
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,790
different ways to approach this problem
but the bad guys are going to constantly

255
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:05,820
morphing change their game is really
about having the experience

256
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,790
intelligence and that and technology to
back that up because you don't have

257
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,340
enough

258
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,129
hours to do everything manually let's
talk about the impact of the traditional

259
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,010
model and explain what I consider to be
the traditional model this is the five

260
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,970
things that you're told the phone in
order to have a secure network firewall

261
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,929
whether to next general not just hopping
on a virus can't have any health

262
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:31,470
information or personally identifiable
information or credit card information

263
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,659
without a TV spam filtering and then the
other two are iffy you know maybe people

264
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:41,169
are allowed to go anywhere they want on
the web so web security or proxy up to

265
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,760
you and I D S IPS intrusion detection
intrusion prevention those are the five

266
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,908
things that if we were talking three
years ago I know all of you have budget

267
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:53,350
for that and that's what you feel like
you buy and that's your protected that's

268
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:59,480
what you're supposed to be doing that's
not working so the statistics of what

269
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,080
the traditional model does and if you
notice the one that says a hundred

270
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,250
percent of the bottom everybody was up
to date this isn't your fault that this

271
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,679
is happening in the network you can have
the up-to-date firewall course reviews

272
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,490
up today you've you've upgraded
everything you've done everything that

273
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,340
the vendors have told you to do and
you're still getting power in the

274
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,590
network so on average last year two
hundred and five days of the average

275
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:28,070
that a hacker says resident the network
now that's actually vastly improved 2013

276
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:34,120
it was two hundred and twenty-nine days
and in 2012 it was 243 days so we've

277
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,389
made some we shift a month and a half
off almost that's still a lot of time to

278
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,070
be in a network and they basically own
everything if I defeat for my house for

279
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,559
that long they've taken not only the
electronics that the taken the kitchen

280
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,970
sink and seeing if they can sell it on
Craigslist while they're still in my

281
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,090
house so it's it's a long time to be in
a network and it's a lot of data that

282
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,750
can be gathered about all of your
behavior just like we're gathering data

283
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:05,419
about their behavior they're doing the
same about us once you do discover that

284
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:08,480
some things in your network in and by
the way about seventy percent of the

285
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,590
time it's it's not of your own volition
you have somebody else telling you you

286
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,510
have something in the network whether to
three-letter agency like the CIA the FBI

287
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,140
it could be visa saying

288
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,850
hey we think your compromise because a
lot of credit card transactions from

289
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,980
your location people who have used
credit cards at your location seemed to

290
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,820
be breached so it's going to be a
typically a third party that's gonna

291
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,960
knock on your door in city of our

292
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,170
gonna take about a month to get it out
no matter who you hire that's how long

293
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,550
it takes to get on every single in
points if it's gone lateral see if it's

294
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:49,139
there because we're not looking for file
remember 48% doesn't use a file doesn't

295
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,580
use a service so we're looking for other
things on the on the system maybe access

296
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:02,110
access with elevated credentials that
now the average cost of a breach is

297
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,770
different for everybody so this is gonna
be the big guys who lost millions and

298
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,410
millions of dollars down to the little
guys who only a couple hundred thousand

299
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:15,399
dollars but the average cost last year
was 3.5 million dollars on average

300
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:26,789
so firearms approach to this it's a
little cut off over there are technology

301
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:32,009
we use our technology to do two things
prevent what we know absolutely we've

302
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:35,369
seen this before we've seen the
command-and-control before one block it

303
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:40,389
but really it's to detect things that
have no signature across multiple

304
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:45,918
sectors across your organization
leveraging the intelligence that we've

305
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,559
gathered through incident response the
intelligence that we've gathered through

306
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,119
having and points and network censors
out their email sensors out there and of

307
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,468
course any intelligence that's published
I'm so that's the detective prevent

308
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:04,669
heart that's going to be your technology
piece but being able to respond and

309
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:09,889
analyzed that and actually make an
intelligent decision wiping the system

310
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:13,279
that alerts from a fire I doesn't
necessarily get the hacker out when we

311
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,570
have lateral spread in effect so you
want to be able to not only detected and

312
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,749
prevented but when it does come through
when something does come through

313
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:27,899
you want to be able to contain it
understand the impact of what it did

314
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:32,889
investigated know everything be able to
reconstruct the whole kill chain and

315
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,218
then get it out of the network as quick
as possible so when someone asked me

316
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:41,919
like in a quick two minutes or less than
that what what is it that fire I does we

317
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,179
take the average hacker living in a
network at two hundred and five days in

318
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:50,649
reduce its minutes that's what fire I
does so the whole idea of the spin well

319
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:55,178
here's to basically use the technology
and use the services that you can

320
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,669
augment your own security team get the
stuff out as soon as you detect that

321
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,669
it's in the network before it has a
chance to take a copy of everything that

322
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,990
you do a document all of your behavior
in your procedures

323
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,630
that's pretty much it
