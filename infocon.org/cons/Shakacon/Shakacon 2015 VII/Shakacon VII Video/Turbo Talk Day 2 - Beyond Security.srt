1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,930
so thanks for inviting me and I don't
have any power points cause I think it's

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:12,129
pretty bad for the digestion so i hope i
hope you're ok with that

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,859
jedoch I'm from your security men talked
about her for the disclosure program

4
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,310
which is to put it in a sentence

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,680
way to make money from 40 days without
selling it to to the bat thi aur or

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,670
without going over but first just a
couple of words about job security for

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,530
those who don't know us we actually
focus on testing tools so we develop

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,460
automated security testing tools we've
got

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,489
assessment tool network and web to get
your scanner which I guess the main

10
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,680
point there would be no false positives
so ask me about our false-positive

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,510
guarantee and send it to be fine a false
positive I'm gonna send you a bottle of

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:05,158
scotch just not across state lines ok
but we will have our business mobility

13
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,950
management tool we've got a father so if
you wanna be cool like Charlie

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,909
cars we've got the automated tool to do
that to make you look really good but

15
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:22,960
what I want to focus on as I said his
daughter Bobbi disclosure program and

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,460
I'll come to explain where we got to it
and why we're doing it so back in 1998

17
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,699
that's where we start the company we
started with the security portal cause

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,700
security there for those who remember
its security dot com and I've disclose

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,590
your guys so I think everything should
be disclosed and publish I still think

20
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,079
that but we got to work with a lot of
researchers and we've got a lot of

21
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,419
feedback that he wanna get paid right
and we all remember the

22
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:01,619
the no no dollar no bugs movement so and
I get that that's fair enough but you

23
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,310
want to get paid also want to make sure
your your day doesn't get used against

24
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:16,230
your grandma or in Libya someplace if
you're reading the emails now and you

25
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,250
also sometimes I mean better disclosure
programs are great but Chris Evans is

26
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,989
still here if not at all said you may or
may not get money you man when I get

27
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,370
credit right to use these things are
kind of a black hole you a bit of the

28
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,620
vendor and you know what happens but you
might not wanna get sued so to give them

29
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,250
on a protected from lawsuits make sure
it goes to the right place gives give

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,180
still give you the credit plus allow you
to choose where use your days will go to

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,400
be set up just for OBD disclosure
program called securities securities

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,530
closure or SSD and we basically happens
is you give us information about the

33
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,269
security of contact us an exclusive you
can do to contact us and I defense for

34
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:12,940
we care as long as you don't really see
any technical information yet and you'll

35
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,459
say we have a bottle bTW I have a
meeting in this product this application

36
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,220
we've got a pretty large set of
customers most of them are commercial

37
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:30,420
enterprises so not he lays stranger
agencies all of them have been vetted so

38
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,320
you're not sell anything to China and
Russia doesn't go into a shell

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,819
corporation to be used who knows where
and we asked him are you interested in

40
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,319
that kind of thing

41
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,388
some of them will say yes and then we'll
ask you for a price will get a ballpark

42
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:52,340
figure from them and will say hey does
this make sense to you make sense to you

43
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,290
may access to them where we escrow the
deal so you don't get exposed and get

44
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:03,209
exposed we coordinated disclosure with
the vendor I got you get to choose you

45
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,019
have a lot of things i mean the way we
treat it is it's it's basically your

46
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:16,399
information so you can say these are
places we don't want to go to and that's

47
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,828
ok you can say I want the credit or
don't want to credit or what it really

48
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,960
anonymous you know these things out to
you and and and we do make a lot of

49
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,789
profit but it's not a revenue-generating
thing in our company I mean the money

50
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:35,199
you make off it is very small so what we
do with a profit is basically we

51
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,280
sponsored conferences like this so we
find the community conferences so that's

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,219
the kind of our way to give back to the
community health the researchers we

53
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,590
think

54
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,700
and feel like gap exists today where
there's people who want to buy your

55
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:58,280
duties but for good reasons not for nazi
professor breezes this people find your

56
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,770
days when I get money for it and i dont
wanna help make that happen so if you're

57
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,280
interested in if you find a reason
you're interested finally I'm the only

58
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:18,940
white pat here she noticed or look up
security security schools or if you

59
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,800
wanna test out our scanner and and see
if you can get that bottle of scotch

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,400
then you know contact me as well other
than that I hope you enjoy the lunch i'm
