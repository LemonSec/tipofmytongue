1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,690
alright well I thank you from getting up
at 8:15 a.m. talk I wasn't quite sure

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,950
what to expect in this is also

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,169
so we talked a bit about products that's
the current product that i'm looking

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,270
after Google but before we get into
project zero gonna take a little step

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,180
back in time I'm going to look at what
things look like and some observations

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,710
were making before reform project zero
I'm gonna talk about his observations

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,260
and understand that making some
observations as what led us to form

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,110
project zero and i think is quite
interesting observations to go and talk

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,670
about because I'm sure most of you in
this room table will at least understand

10
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,730
what the observations are trying to say
and possibly agree with them but not

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,540
everyone is aware of some of the things
we were observing I think this is

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,730
important because some of these
observations are not immediately obvious

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,019
and if you don't take them on board

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,940
you might find yourself making
suboptimal decisions for security for

15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:13,050
the security company and and that's
unfortunate

16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,160
so the first observation made in the
run-up to find products 0 is really

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,970
believe that offensive security research
being done in the open is drying up just

18
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,940
to say that year-on-year less and less
of the of the top offensive research has

19
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,610
been done in published in the open the
factors behind that fairly obvious

20
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,330
there's been a big infusion of cash from
the private space research is done in

21
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,789
the private and generally doesn't see
the light of day and that's one of the

22
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,130
forces that leading to research done
here from drying up and we think this is

23
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,890
a problem we think that if there's less
offensive security research being done

24
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,030
in the open then we might start to think
hey things are looking really good we're

25
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,150
not seeing much good offensive security
research going on maybe we'll make maybe

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,950
wouldn't really well as defenders I
don't think that's actually true i think

27
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,620
is a danger that we might start to
complete that if offensive security

28
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,220
research done in the open continues to
dry up this is one of the things we

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:14,960
decided not to tackle the formation of
project zero the second observation is

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,830
that targeted taxes no days are on the
increase is actually quite a hard

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,300
decision to make

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,680
generally but but recently it seems like
that if the defendants have had a bit of

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,560
a rally and detected quite a few
targeted attacks using everyday so it's

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,050
now easier to to give data saying that
these things are on the increase was

35
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,410
seeing like one of the sponsors here
fire IRS seem to be doing more recent

36
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,980
years detecting some some targeted
attacks so they say they're on the

37
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,970
increase

38
00:02:49,970 --> 00:03:00,410
so what do we do with this observation
what we do as I forgot an organization

39
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:07,329
with proposition 30 we'll come back to
that observation three is a continuation

40
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:16,860
of sort of the theme Maspero days are
actually getting RERA there was one

41
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,600
earlier this year

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,460
surprise me because I haven't seen a
mass malware o'day attack for a long

43
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,200
time so surprised to see how this year
but generally they're getting pretty

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,679
rare and again this is another sort of
loss of data thing when there is a mass

45
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,240
mala out using a tactic goes on it's
pretty noisy things that get the text it

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,209
right and that's good for defenders when
we detect something we get data can use

47
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,780
outdated to move forward to fix things
and so on

48
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,900
remembered what I was trying to get into
observation number too so the danger

49
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,200
here is that you do your design you run
your security program based on what you

50
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,970
can see and what you can see is the mass
morrow days are getting mara what you

51
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,040
can see is the apt is using targeted oh
days they get court then the best ones

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,440
obviously because they got caught so
what we do see in this basis the tip of

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,310
the iceberg there's a lot going on we
don't see what you need to do as a

54
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,280
defender is have confidence in the
assertion that there's always stuff

55
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,960
going on there not seeing and act as if
that's present and doing by doing so you

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,030
can act you you might make some good
progress if you act just based on what

57
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,059
you see you might make correct decisions
one of the and give a concrete example

58
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:42,560
there's one thing that we think we think
is true is that when the defender finds

59
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,760
find some vulnerability chances are
because of the asymmetry between amount

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,620
of cash for private offensive research
vs Man cash resources for the public

61
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,390
offensive research laughing smaller
chances are the winner defender finds

62
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,659
about get shorty known to the attackers
and at least once you realize that

63
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,569
observation that leads to some

64
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,789
new behaviors for example might suddenly
realized that when you become aware bug

65
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:09,429
may be quickly because chances are
there's another actors that are where

66
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:15,589
the same bug so there's the observations
and sort of combination of his

67
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:21,709
observations led us to think well is
there something we can do to help combat

68
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:26,199
some of the problems inherent some of
these observations so enter product zero

69
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:32,490
mission statement is make out a hard
there's kind of an implication in that

70
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,059
mission statement that which is that we
don't think of it as hard and I think

71
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:38,189
the evidence is there

72
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:46,050
days not hard just in the news recently
we've seen we've seen the hacking team

73
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,789
attack has been big news recently
they're not the stealthy as mister top

74
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:53,248
tier actor and yet they have access to
zero day therefore maybe that means

75
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:58,909
they're not hard getting a lot of
detection of Nations Davis nation state

76
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:04,509
B days there's a lot of different
players there are few countries since

77
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,709
everyone seems to have these have these
things maybe we can conclude that

78
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:14,909
they're not hard so I mission statement
we want to try and make them this is

79
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,110
something we can we can do alone some
people mistakenly think that we're gonna

80
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,099
like charged a battle and solve this
problem ourselves of course we're not

81
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,058
going to it will you know relatively
small team but we do think there is a

82
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:29,449
significant piece we can play in the
wider community of people trying to make

83
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:35,999
a diehard I'm going to get into that so
this is a project here pretty serious

84
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:41,869
current identity by describe it it's a
feud identity I think our mission

85
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,430
statement is probably going to remain
the same over time but how we go about

86
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,839
accomplishing that mission

87
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,849
well that's subject to change the way we
go about to come coming up mission is

88
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,669
we've decided to become the tax research
team

89
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:59,099
vulnerability research we developed we
develop exploits we do all of this in

90
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,139
public it's important we think that it
is a community and layer on top of each

91
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,949
others work they have the best chance of
actually getting some success in this

92
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:12,449
space we're not just an attack research
team or to put it another way we find

93
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:12,900
that

94
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,229
we think that you can defend the best
when you understand the tax in great

95
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,270
detail so we're trying to get to the
stage where we understand that attack in

96
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,659
great detail and when we do that we
think then we'll be in a good position

97
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,000
to sort of take a step back and did
designs and defenses that will stop the

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,340
best attacks that we think we're capable
of doing that's what we're doing

99
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,159
currently so I built this team so we
have a link back some of these

100
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,340
observations but one thing we're excited
to do is provide what we think is pretty

101
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,119
dream job for the for the top tier
offensive security researchers go back

102
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,130
to observation number one sense of
security research done the opens drying

103
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:57,130
up well we can directly counter that by
providing some jobs where people who are

104
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:04,449
the bestest get to do vented security
research in the open if you look at the

105
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:08,110
situation before project zero you can
find that people who are the best

106
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,229
offensive security research they do what
they do primary because they love what

107
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,330
they do so they're gonna find somewhere
to do that question is what

108
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,039
opportunities do they have well as loss
of opportunity in the private space and

109
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,449
now pretty clear adds an additional
compelling option we believe in the

110
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:30,400
public space we set out as a source of
data if we if we do nothing but just

111
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,760
sort of China bugs and exploits and we
want to do more than that is like a

112
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,400
briefing earlier but if that's all we
did that would be quite a valuable

113
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,208
source of data we think and we were
ready saying a lot of people in the

114
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:46,150
defensive community looking at some of
our tax and thinking that's really

115
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,459
interesting I'm thought of that but
maybe I can think of defense against

116
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:52,189
that and we've since we've seen various
things now people working on papers that

117
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,610
you know sites I'll work i will like the
thought of being a source of data that

118
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,640
enables the defenders to think about
things that are otherwise the data

119
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,930
source may have been driving driving up
we're not just the technical team a

120
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,719
mission statement doesn't say we're just
the technical team says make it a hard

121
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,480
so obviously we can consider
non-technical measures to try and make

122
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,690
it a hard one thing we're doing it on
the side of our technical work is a

123
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,940
progressive influence on the industry if
you would think it's a bit cynical we

124
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,329
could say that we've been trying some of
the same things for twenty years in our

125
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:30,670
tree and the old days are still coming
in so so maybe there's room to try

126
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,459
something new things and different
things and we're definitely going to be

127
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,748
doing that we're going to get into one
of the things we've been trying a bit

128
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:41,779
later but just to say that we're not
purely a technical team we're so

129
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:46,339
whatever it takes time so if we think of
some economic or political leader we can

130
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:55,379
pull that will make it harder than that
so what sort of things we're doing a

131
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:01,100
moment to make a day or so and this is
back to some of the technical work but

132
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,999
we didn't have an opportunity to tweak
the economy of vulnerabilities and then

133
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,199
bug sales we think we think there's a
few too many what we call obvious bugs

134
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:17,290
out there that means that there are bugs
bugs out there and software that can be

135
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,230
found in a very small amount of time by
by someone who has experience in this

136
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,869
area and that's no good so by mopping up
the obvious bugsy want to at least make

137
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:30,230
sure that someone who doesn't this space
has to be quite talented and that we

138
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,709
think will tweak the economy a little
bit once we've done a couple of rounds

139
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:38,508
trying to mop up obvious bugs and we
talked about the economy the the

140
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:43,929
situation to talk about but collisions
so this is where we do some research and

141
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:49,119
we find a bug and get it fixed and it
turns out that some other apt actor had

142
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:53,110
that bug that's what about collision and
that's expensive in the eighties have to

143
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,069
go buy another one of these things and
make bigger and more expensive now with

144
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:00,759
his son we do track something we don't
have details on because some of this

145
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,509
source of information to come in to us
about what we do and do not live with

146
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,879
nations day or be a little bit sensitive
but it happened has happened in multiple

147
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:14,720
factors we have collided with the bugs
and that's quite appealing to us making

148
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,269
a better job to the best offensive
researchers but that's also an economy

149
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:23,199
things we take someone from the private
space into the public space we've we've

150
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:26,029
lowered the supply on the private side
and increase the supply on the on the

151
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,510
public side

152
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:34,170
so aside from popping up obvious bugs we
are investing in mitigation

153
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,459
published like in this space yet but we
have some things coming up quite excited

154
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,270
about tooling is not is another area
that we're working on and scale the fact

155
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,819
that we're currently doing this it
Google is awesome if we have some

156
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,720
computational processes emphysema want
to do you want to do it cost ten

157
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,230
thousand sheen's to get results could
result in a day and we can get 10,000

158
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,160
machines the press the buttons that is
quite nice that we've got that scale

159
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,030
available to us hope you can now sell
some of the the lower tier attackers

160
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,189
certainly particularly mopping up
something obvious bucks wanna be a force

161
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,750
multiplier is a theme going back to book
by sharing this data we think that we

162
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,680
can enable other people that are trying
to defend otherwise might not have these

163
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,579
data because it's drying up and get
industry change will come in to discuss

164
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:30,840
one of the big industry changes were
trying to effect shortly so today sort

165
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,470
of deeper down from the mission
statement down to their technicals

166
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,660
strategies

167
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,370
strategy in the two princes will be
seeing the strategy it's subject to

168
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,320
change

169
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,910
re-evaluated every year because of the
stupid strategy first prince's court

170
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:53,850
eliminating low-hanging fruit and this
is back to mopping up the obvious bugs

171
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,710
can t think we think it's just too easy
to take some popular well use software

172
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,690
run a father across it and get some
bucks that's not a huge investment for

173
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:08,570
something to do and really uncool
position as an industry so we are trying

174
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,790
to eliminate is low-hanging fruit I'm
gonna try and do it by utilizing some of

175
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,689
the machine was also discussed earlier
like us something when we need 10,000

176
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,100
machines instead of maybe some sort of
maybe people competing against you know

177
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,170
I've got machines are there is doing it
in a basement in some cases so you gonna

178
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:33,810
bring an end to dumb fussing just by
using our scale and being thorough and

179
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,000
just

180
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,180
sweeping across all of the popular
software that people are using a

181
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,380
software platform this caller's name
here that's ongoing there's a lot of

182
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,980
software to sweep over to limit
low-hanging creeper we're trying to

183
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,880
crank it out as best we can see that
there would be accessible on it by

184
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,290
looking at some of the numbers were
hitting the other types of the other

185
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,550
technical strategy painters perhaps more
interesting

186
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,310
the last half of the bug chain so one of
the areas where the industry is done

187
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,839
well recently is going to compromise
someone's machine a lot of the advanced

188
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,400
attacks we're seeing involve multiple
bucks to achieve compromise of the

189
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,170
target typically 22 is multiples better
than one but this is a testament to the

190
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,870
rise of sandboxing primary so a lot of
the software that we all rely on day in

191
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,710
day out and there's a fine line of the
internet is like web browsers and so on

192
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,150
most of them now as some books so as an
attacker to compromise some machine you

193
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,050
get your foot in the front door by
compromising the browser and then you're

194
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,189
in the sandbox environment and depending
on the operating system you need another

195
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,630
bug to bust out of the sandbox and get
full control of the target machine to

196
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,820
the last of the big chain is this some
books breakout generally attackers it

197
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:05,280
made an interesting thing here is in our
experience these two bugs the bugs in

198
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,260
the browser in summer break up it's
harder to break out of the samples and

199
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,800
we see this in in in many many cases
like some of them even in the pricing

200
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,650
data how much it costs by Islamic State
vs by like a flash vulnerability to

201
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,300
extend the pricing tells you how hard
each of these things are but also just

202
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,689
intuitively like a browser is a huge
taxes whereas a good some books has a

203
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,560
relatively small taxes meaning that
there are a limited number of avenues by

204
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,140
which might start trying to break out of
it so therefore we think a lot of the

205
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,800
bug chain the bugs have higher
contention what this means there are

206
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,000
fewer of them means that when we
research in this area and we find bugs

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,520
that a higher chance of bugs

208
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:55,560
we covered that is an important economic
economic aspect area and the sorts of

209
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,619
sorts of target your search here either
the colonel and and and and parts of the

210
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,480
sandbox and by focusing on the loss
after the big game for exam results here

211
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,410
we think we can have some benefit
because you don't really need to

212
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,140
eliminate all the bugs winter break the
bug change so that it's hard to get full

213
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,490
compromiser someone do that by focusing
on the weather there are fewer bugs and

214
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,130
opportunities to break out so you look
through some of our publications and a

215
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,110
bug finance today you see quite a few of
them operating system kernel issues

216
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,860
because we're trying that's one way you
can break out of a sandbox trying to

217
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:36,090
sweep that clean so how do we choose
what software we're going to work on

218
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:44,580
what specific named pieces awful gonna
work on while we sort of mix in and come

219
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,360
up with a fairly obvious answer actually
by disgruntled employees are observed

220
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,760
the tax of a very interesting if we
actually if the defendants were actually

221
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,819
catch someone attacking someone in the
wild with that sir

222
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,880
data point that says I this target is an
interesting attackers this target is the

223
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,180
way that someone might get their foot in
the door for organization there for that

224
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:09,329
kind of but in make it inclined to bump
up the party of that target external

225
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:14,458
feedback said there's people that feed
information to us that's pretty helpful

226
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:19,480
in in targeting going to work on and
also internal deduction is quite

227
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,290
surprising how they had this happen how
this works so well actually but we just

228
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,659
sit down for lunch and have a thought
exercise so we're going to want to break

229
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,110
out of the crime some books on Windows
how we gonna do that sort of

230
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,110
brainstorming we sell we look at this
area for a bug here we do that and then

231
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:43,439
we spent a project to go and find bugs
in that area and time and time again we

232
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,280
find that the real attackers are
thinking very similar similarly to us

233
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,540
because attackers often follows similar

234
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,540
I guess the path of least resistance the
path of most obvious path to finding a

235
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,620
bug so time and time again we find that
things were working on other things that

236
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,810
really taxes are using for example in
the recent hacking team disclosure they

237
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:09,919
they had a couple of days and both of
those days were very very very very

238
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,320
similar areas to areas where we can help
protect ongoing eliminate those days to

239
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,149
say that that we probably would have
bugged collided with at least one of

240
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:25,430
those given a given a bit more time so
given what we're seeing and mixing all

241
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,880
his input together there's a lot of pain
is going on out there against and

242
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,360
client-side am so if your goal is to
steal something for an organization it's

243
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,459
getting less Commons has sort of hammer
at the front door trim break into

244
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,010
service directly much more common to
just break into someone's actual machine

245
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,650
on that desk and then from there sort of
a look around the corporation and spread

246
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,890
from there so putting it all together we
were looking at these named a piece of

247
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,160
software here and these are the these
are the piece of these are the things

248
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,810
the suffering of running in your pocket
and iOS from the laptop is probably

249
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,030
running either Windows OS X or Linux
although this is a time where one person

250
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,540
like get excited he says I'm going
online or something but generally BSD

251
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,050
yes we have someone that's not running
on

252
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,790
thank you this that external feedback
second bullet point top factor that in

253
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,570
turn a candid discussions about what
targets to go and have a look at thank

254
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,820
you

255
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,129
houses of course some reason we missed
our safari there but I have also enjoyed

256
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,280
all of the Opera browser of interest not
certain if significant interest to

257
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,840
attackers of interest to us and also a
lot of attacks could occur via documents

258
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,310
like Office documents PDFs for Adobe
Reader so we'll hit that too and I think

259
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:52,649
this will come as a surprise to anyone
when in a couple weeks time the next big

260
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,050
instant kicks off you know chances are
it'll be one of these pieces of software

261
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,360
listed here that was the foot in the
door for that incident

262
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,000
say results say they don't describe
people are asking questions so I

263
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,240
answered in the presentation but one of
the most common questions is how many

264
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,640
bugs have you dealt with since the
formation of projects area so the number

265
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,250
there is $127 large number a lot of that
comes from the eliminating low-hanging

266
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,559
fruit technical answer that we we
covered earlier because its low hanging

267
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:29,160
fruit by definition it's kind of a fair
amount of this crap 227 bug so far that

268
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:36,380
because runs we've published 25 blog
posts many technical one of those were

269
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,340
quite proud of getting quite a following
on the blog as being a source of

270
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,620
high-quality offensive research done in
the open as well as is one of 14 goals

271
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:55,360
we've probably the most like to have her
off there is a guest post on some deer

272
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,678
and research woodrow how much that a bit
of attention because that was a software

273
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,540
vulnerability but a hardware assisted
vulnerabilities I was quite interesting

274
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:09,049
I'll give out the blog address later he
wants to follow it despite the breakdown

275
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:17,270
of where we found the bug that we found
my vendor despite us not necessarily

276
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,320
indicative of how we validated our
effort it's indicative of where we found

277
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,879
the results so it's kind of a mix of
where we put the effort and how many

278
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,770
boxes there are any given product so the
largest chunk that pies due to some

279
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,400
pretty heavy investment we put into
Adobe Flash again that comes from

280
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,200
external feedback which took a flash
over mentioned fire I but I think they

281
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,049
over the past month or two they've
caught some actual real fasho days being

282
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,830
used external feedback and observe
attacks that that's all that's factored

283
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:56,020
into why that blue piece of pie charts a
large we've been doing a lot of work on

284
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,510
Apple operating systems particularly on
the the sandbox escape area of things we

285
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,530
found that perhaps that the kernel there
wasn't one so robust as we'd hoped for a

286
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,928
confirmed component this on the front
line of defense against a mistake so

287
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,659
we've done some work there

288
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:15,149
a few bugs Microsoft of a big chunk of
the pie of course a very important

289
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:19,529
platform used by a lot of people found
so far

290
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:26,239
brings us on to disclose deadlines again
because it's something everyone asked

291
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:30,739
about it was briefly a hot topic earlier
this year and this is one of the

292
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:35,619
non-technical pieces of work that we're
doing in 40 mentioned earlier we do have

293
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:41,168
some non-technical dependency project
zero so he's a disclosure deadline what

294
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:44,919
is a disclosure deadline that's where
when we send of our ability to a vendor

295
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,909
we say well after a certain amount of
time we believe that the right of people

296
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:50,879
to know about the risk

297
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:56,219
exceeds your right to take a long time
fixing something we celebrated that that

298
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,879
line currently ninety days

299
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:02,639
calibrated that something we think it's
evil something and we look at the data

300
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:05,149
how she had blood in a minute

301
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:08,459
ninety days because as the industry
sought to be better and better guess

302
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:15,159
what we're gonna do tonight number who
gonna ratcheted down and skipping a

303
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,979
bullet point here but faster response
times I think everyone in his prop-

304
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:24,559
faster response times it just reminds us
of why it comes back with the

305
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,389
observations you made earlier we're kind
of knowledge saying that in the current

306
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:31,889
state of the industry when the defender
find a bug just because of the weighting

307
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:36,629
of this many attackers this many
defenders chances are the attackers are

308
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:41,369
you know about every bug defenders
coming across so that we like whoa yes

309
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:46,080
well faster response time to limit the
exposure in days for the bug that we

310
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,259
find things are starting to become an
industry norm we were delighted this is

311
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,279
a long time ago now when people started
coming to us to Google with discovery's

312
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,190
against some of Google's products and
saying hey that's nice a deadline on

313
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,830
this you know we were delighted that
means that this idea is catching on and

314
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,949
we're seeing that more and more later on
after sliding carriages researches to do

315
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,509
this and encouragement after we cover
some days I thinks she's the boss is

316
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:17,290
effective

317
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:24,800
so yes that's getting some results of
disclosure deadline so this is how

318
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:33,139
things used to be in March 2015 ramstad
sandefur started talking about it then

319
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,400
despite I hear is shows that for all of
our ability to send to all the vendors

320
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,090
what percentage for cheap nice a
deadline and walks and dismissed so what

321
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:48,860
time do this before we get arrested on
it wasn't far off like 90 days as well

322
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,490
calibrated we think because we got 95%
success rate not perfect as a bit of the

323
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,130
bitter read that as some people having
trouble getting my set deadlines so we

324
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,940
treat our policies we we are getting
ahead of myself that but we we decided

325
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,120
that we'll talk to missus of this
deadline and they're all really close to

326
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,399
90 days so we were just a few days off
in our initial guess in ninety days

327
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,320
being a good starting point so we have a
grace period or if you almost make

328
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,610
ninety days but not quite

329
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,490
because you've got a patch coming up
week to week later we had something we

330
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:29,040
called grace period which is up to 14
days that resulted in this are two

331
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,310
things that resulted in the spy john
wants a grace period edition and the

332
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:37,060
other people realizing that we were
serious about this and taking it more

333
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,790
seriously than the combined effect of
these two things is that genuine

334
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,070
deadline exceeded

335
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,929
failed to meet ninety days to pack
something is now percentage changes in

336
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:56,630
its pretty small this grace period has
is represented by orange here has kind

337
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:02,140
of pushed almost all over the edge like
almost all people getting disclosure

338
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,510
deadline bugs are now hitting that
deadline she look specifically into what

339
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,220
went wrong with the with that little
piece of red that represents actually

340
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,490
four bucks just for bugs and each one
has a has a unique story of the team

341
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,620
that is not that huge deal deadline was
missed by for example one was not a very

342
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,719
serious bargaining an attempt was made
to patch the bug within deadline just

343
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,070
the Packers correct to say that

344
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,810
it almost doesn't count the other cases
were but it seems like people are

345
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,940
missing deadlines anymore when you
actually look beyond the stats and

346
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,530
beyond the Piton look at the individual
deadline misses its like disclosure

347
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,300
deadlines or something that is an
industry that we can do them so we're

348
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:52,668
quite happy with how that's worked now

349
00:26:52,669 --> 00:27:07,299
have to verify the vulnerability was
fixed so so what we do is we find a

350
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:10,489
vulnerability and we don't send a
vulnerability someone and start the

351
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:15,350
deadline for kicking less pressure there
is availability using you know our

352
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:34,699
resources and availability

353
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,760
question-and-answer picked up on the mic
people might have heard it but what

354
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,340
about the time I think you're saying it
takes for the vendor receiving a report

355
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:50,179
to verify that the vulnerability is as
described as real as is correct very

356
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,730
good question so we talked about this
before we started doing this and we

357
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,160
decided one way that we want to make it
easy for someone receiving availability

358
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,700
to do the right thing and the way you do
that is to the best of our ability to

359
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,410
submit very high quality report so much
three paragraph describes an abstract

360
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:13,360
condition climate vulnerability wheres
for example reports against microsoft

361
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,280
office I think demonstrate good quality
reports to the report is like over

362
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,840
microsoft office this file is the proof
of concept for you open this file in

363
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,919
this version of Office again this
version of Windows you will see a crash

364
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,580
I'll try to be highly diligent in
verifying that we will I be demonstrated

365
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,699
condition more than that we then go and
saying here's what the crash looks like

366
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,070
in the debugger and here's the assembly
conditions around the crash

367
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,220
demonstrating that there's no adverse
impact 22 this question that we found

368
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:47,870
the real package so that it's easy for
some for security engineer receiving the

369
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:53,060
report also understand in-depth security
to look at it and say yes this is a good

370
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:58,620
rapport and do if we have ascended bad
report 2000 anyone hear anything is bad

371
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,419
here call us on it we want quality
report we could say that there's minimal

372
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:11,059
time in arguing about whether something
sensible mobility

373
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:27,519
down here is progressing companies too
many researchers here I think this

374
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,940
compelling evidence here to say that the
disclosure deadlines work in terms of

375
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,649
actually being there achievable and also
we think we have the the date range of

376
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:41,100
contacts to say that disclosure
deadlines helped by limiting exposure of

377
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:48,840
bugs that statistically attackers social
researcher he's considered using

378
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,428
disclosure deadline right ones who don't
like it don't do it next time but it's

379
00:29:52,429 --> 00:30:01,179
something you might consider trying
later this year we're gonna try and

380
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:08,179
expand 40 there's only so much we can do
as little team in one company we think

381
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:12,740
this is an umbrella under which people
can rally right research done in the

382
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,419
open research for the research for
further benefit of the public Internet

383
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:21,399
we think this is we think there's some
form of rallying banner here and other

384
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:24,539
projects around brother who are going to
be inviting people to join us more and

385
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:29,389
more and I don't necessarily have the
mechanics of work we're going to do all

386
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:32,998
safely landed yet but just gonna do
something here and we really wanna get a

387
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:38,850
community going this more than just one
little team in one company so if you're

388
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:44,110
in if that sort of very vague sales
pitch appeals to you at all now getting

389
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,809
touched come and talk to me afterwards
even give me ideas if you're willing to

390
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:53,619
on this might look like if we expanded
this to be an industry-wide think very

391
00:30:53,619 --> 00:31:02,399
happy to get feedback here she's lost a
bullet points and at the same time made

392
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:10,360
to the slides like just before he was
talking to a duplicate it myself but I

393
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,029
also think there's room for like every
company who relies on the security of

394
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:21,389
the open Internet Security of common
endpoint software we think there's

395
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:26,049
why doesn't every company have a team is
doing this this just trying to look out

396
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:29,839
for the security of all of us I mean
that's another way that we could have

397
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,450
more people under this project is your
umbrella I mean we're not doing that

398
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,869
well as defenders right i mean is this
the tax going around or flying around

399
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:41,718
all the time and irritated that so then
we all should we all be investing more

400
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:46,999
resources especially if we don't depend
on on the internet for business I think

401
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:50,539
that's as a business case to be made
there that that every company that is

402
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:56,299
big enough to have a big security teams
have some sensitive security team just

403
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,649
hiring the best just letting them
letting them do what they think needs to

404
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,408
be done I think there's a case to be
made that if there are any progressive

405
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:05,249
companies here just getting in getting
into this then I'm very open to

406
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:15,190
cooperation come talk to me of follow-up
was doing a time to do something

407
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:20,269
interesting which we try and i truly
blog about it mostly this is a blog that

408
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:26,379
is full of what we can get high-quality
attack research so that done done in

409
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:29,939
public for the public so if you want to
go and what we're doing to subscribe to

410
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,599
the blog if you want to Skype what we do
on a very much more fine-grained level

411
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,059
of detail you can actually going to
describe to a bug tracker so whenever we

412
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:47,139
publish any vulnerability typically do
that when i text you can in real time

413
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:51,988
see when we do that it's gonna be nice
if you do that you've got funding 27

414
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:54,779
bucks on the files you can get a lot of
updates but if you're interested in

415
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,009
what's going on doesn't something else
you can subscribe to

416
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:02,889
we're hiring interested in coming in
doing top tier attack research in the

417
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:08,168
open up and talk to me and with that
would be really happy to take any

418
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:21,090
questions that anyone out there

419
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,179
I guess the question was that we
recently did a publication on our blog

420
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:30,130
about her vulnerability in the ESET
antivirus engine is that fixed yes we

421
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:35,960
did the blog post after the fix was live
antivirus engines and other quite

422
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,160
aggressively toward updating their
signatures in a very short amount of

423
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,070
time after after he said fixed and push
the vulnerability everyone had to fix

424
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:52,090
that point we we published a book based
on that research

425
00:33:52,090 --> 00:34:18,130
question

426
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:26,010
questions are asked that and then but
then by Jimmy for the second to get onto

427
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,010
the first questions was about method of
publication like when when a deadline is

428
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:36,030
exceeded how do we go about the
publication good question because we

429
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:41,470
recently read the policy for that along
with our along with changing the

430
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:44,449
deadline rules in the grace period since
then I think we've really used it

431
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:48,569
because people are not missing deadlines
any more generally but what we do is

432
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,890
gonna see a deadline miss get published
in real time are bug tracker is where

433
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:57,240
the actual information is stored and
where they view restrictions removed

434
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,100
when it's time deadlines exceeded we're
going to do anything i think is a

435
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:10,009
deadline Misra bug bug bug that maybe
people should be paying attention to you

436
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:16,600
gonna do probably advisory format for
that the best places to post advisories

437
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,790
these days I'll blog it more like
stories and pros around detailed

438
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,290
research and actually a little
announcements

439
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,130
there's a mailing list that over the
course of history of been good for

440
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:58,810
announcing vulnerabilities but kind of
pulling into disuse so maybe put me here

441
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:07,320
observation so publishing a deadline is
discreetly has a certain risk to it so

442
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,840
that's why we were trying to work out
how to publish something more broadly so

443
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,320
i think is a very good we should just
published a blog forget deadline miss or

444
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,210
something like that because it does have
a better time to get picked up and

445
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,600
reported upon

446
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:47,509
that's useful feedback was your third
question you have any idea

447
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:52,710
who beat Alabama bunker ability to
simple we believe that the relationship

448
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:58,520
is between discoveries being the person
who found it and the person who can fix

449
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,610
it

450
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,240
get we tried looking at who we share
this information with gets pretty gnarly

451
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,200
pretty quickly like why does this was
his company large enough to deserve that

452
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,350
information this company is not you know
if we skip it to this particular

453
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,150
government to the USA government will
give it to the russian government should

454
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,680
be given to the Chinese government I
would willingly

455
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,690
a national favorite we just have to wait
for the safety of the open Internet for

456
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:41,200
everyone right so I guess now he quickly
so for now we've kept it simple question

457
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,828
question is what about bug bounty
programs scenario of interests me

458
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,470
personally

459
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:53,390
0 I worked on the chromium banks
programs or chrome browser Google web

460
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:59,629
vulnerability program there is some
overlap here I'm also also work with the

461
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:04,440
internet bug bounty which is like an
industry white background important

462
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,940
software that otherwise does not have a
bug bounty IDC's mobile up there for

463
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,540
example some of the targets that we're
interested in are covered by bug

464
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:21,520
bounties forgot to the target list like
Firefox and Chrome both have their own

465
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,980
bug bounty programs and yeah we were
approached by two programs so they do is

466
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:35,099
they motivate more people to come
forward and do their research in the

467
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:41,200
open that's one of the key tenets of our
teams are very programs programs you

468
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,290
might even launched one ourselves might
want to project a program with the

469
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,040
canisters like very early thinking about
announcing something here just

470
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,200
announcing an intention to think about
something that matters and it but if you

471
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,439
have any thoughts on what would it look
weird look awesome and work well in this

472
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:08,790
space

473
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:15,470
sure

474
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:23,200
compression compression to me is a place
like shrinking but any expansion in

475
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:31,270
prices if you look at the data that's
been published and if you trust in the

476
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:36,340
prices have been steadily up for the
past few years we've not been around

477
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:41,740
long enough white hair and he told make
any specific links about 40 pushing

478
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:48,509
prices up a bit coy about what we
publish in this case because some of the

479
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:56,310
things we hear would rather not been a
source kind of thing but prices are

480
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:03,060
going up

481
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:19,840
yes

482
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:38,540
question to look at you like you can
feel like I'm particularly useful for

483
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:45,110
finding my playground right so what we
do when we sit down

484
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,600
factored in Google products get factored
into our question exactly the same as

485
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,759
any other vendor does so the reason that
i three slices a small I can make some

486
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,570
guesses I'm not sure if this is true but
I mean we look to cover crime I think

487
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,430
the reason we can't find my heart one of
the hardest crimes at a really popular

488
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,310
bug bounty program for the past many
years so a lot of the bugs picked clean

489
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:17,980
by the wider community right we started
looking and rate we found a bunch of

490
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,270
boxes there is another reason that
slices a soul is because the overall

491
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:28,580
figures 427 so that that's easy
represent a no 10 20 bucks we found a

492
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,890
bunch of interesting and reeboks part of
our research I think there is public now

493
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,690
another reason that slices small is that
the person or the couple of people who

494
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:41,030
did some research decided to go after
difficult high-value bugs as opposed to

495
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,980
a maybe more

496
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:51,030
the severity bugs bugs were found and
fixed these are all of you like it here

497
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,340
and this is why are there lots of little
factors that have factored into why that

498
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:45,730
slices small I guess it's not a lack of
looking

499
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:59,880
get involved is currently a feedback
period going on for us'

500
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:06,859
regulation implementation part of that
is a solicitation of open feedback and

501
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:10,470
they are receiving this email believe
robust feedback but if you have some

502
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:15,629
robust feedback to add certainly
wouldn't her without feedback is

503
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,830
obviously making it very clear that the
tent and letter of that law after not

504
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,450
put any restrictions on research done in
the open that's the main thrust of the

505
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,859
feedback going on there and that is the
intent of the personality there is a

506
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:31,580
public domain exemption on the European
version but it's not come across

507
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,850
entirely clearly in the USA version best
best I can tell so any clarification

508
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:43,960
there is like giving feedback is very
powerful I think just the act of doing

509
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,830
good research in the open trying upright
but anyone can do good research in the

510
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:53,590
open and make sure that is something
that a lot of people are doing it makes

511
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:59,350
it a lot of people doing and it's backed
by large corporations like like 30 is

512
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:05,330
that it gets harder to marginalize I
think the more people that do this but

513
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:10,480
also how much a better answer to a
question is good question that's what

514
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:21,580
I've got

515
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,910
ok

516
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,250
questions I think we'll call it
