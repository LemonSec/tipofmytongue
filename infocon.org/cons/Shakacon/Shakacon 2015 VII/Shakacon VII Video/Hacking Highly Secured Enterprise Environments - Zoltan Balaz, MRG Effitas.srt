1
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:27,029
how many of you can buy hardware
firewalls and I promise after the

2
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:36,600
presentation all of you would be able to
do that this is my name and I'm from

3
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,160
Hungary originally and because hunger is
a very small country we are very proud

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,879
of our achievements for example did you
know that the Rubik's Cube has been

5
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:56,920
invented by a Hungarian guy or ok
excellent also first idea of foreign

6
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,090
exchange system was former Hungarian guy
one of the main developers of the basic

7
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,729
language was from Hungary and for
example people with known for his or

8
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:17,100
Linux kernel security patches he's also
from hungary so these are just a few

9
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,520
suppose I work for this company and we
usually do

10
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,259
evidence think this is how we call it
but the many do everybody person I know

11
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:40,330
it doesn't sound very hard job someone
has to do that as a problem out once I

12
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:48,050
was addicted to city of challenges but
after spending days and weeks and months

13
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,330
on the city of challenges I have to
admit that I have a problem so now I'm

14
00:01:52,330 --> 00:02:00,970
in the recovery phase playing city of
games and you also have to know that I'm

15
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:10,128
really into hacking so this is my work
is my hope this is my life so that's

16
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:20,179
what i dooo ok now I want all of you to
close your eyes for five seconds and

17
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,100
just imagine a picture about hacking
high security systems

18
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:38,600
ok if the picture uhm ok during my
presentation I will do something similar

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,840
and other hand some and i dont have the
cables but the second scenario is pretty

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:58,170
the same so let's say that I must buy
low budgets and I want to access to a

21
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,720
secure remote desktop server
organization

22
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,800
let's say that this RDP server contains
confidential documents or something

23
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,440
similar and I need all those files in
order to achieve my goal I need

24
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,150
persistent come to this party piece of
are in order to upload download five

25
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,550
interactive remote code execution stuff
like that

26
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:38,010
easy bored or idea of its really easy
attack I fact one of the clients that

27
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:46,160
stop usually get access to this RDP
server I still his RDP password I love

28
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:53,780
into the RDP server I dropped my member
Dr I have my CNC channel and I got it

29
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:03,590
but in my case things are a bit harder
so let's say that the RDP server is not

30
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:11,300
directly accessible from the internet
also be users are using two factor

31
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,090
authentication to access the RDP server
and I don't have access to the city's

32
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,279
let's say that

33
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,679
RDP drive mapping they're both so it's
not that easy to copy files from and to

34
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,810
the RDP server one of the most important
hardening is that there is a very

35
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,169
restrictive hardware firewall between
the clients

36
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:49,008
and server and this fireball only allows
the communication from the clients to

37
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:57,490
the RDP server to the RDP for only this
is very important and last but not least

38
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,020
there is some application whitelisting
used on the RDP server I have to choose

39
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:12,299
the Microsoft a car for my liking
scenario might want to ask whether this

40
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:20,120
whole scenario is realistic or not and I
had to have made that while I was doing

41
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,819
penetration tasks I had similar client
and the client all those whether or it

42
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:33,189
is possible to hack his environment this
was not the primary goal of the

43
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:38,759
engagement but we told them that yes it
is possible but unfortunately during

44
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:45,759
during the project we didn't have enough
time to pack it so you might want to ask

45
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:59,159
was I seized of the ride was not able to
yes I did is I went home and I started

46
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:12,039
to code all of my hacking tools so let's
say that I'm the spy the bottom and I

47
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:18,960
were they in fact it was stationed at
the client there are thousands of ways

48
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:28,859
to do this like sending the best cat to
the user or something like that and the

49
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:36,949
restrictive Harmer firewall I want to
access the secure remote desktop was

50
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:43,680
working there is no such thing as a
possible only things that are more

51
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,210
challenging you agree we despise man and

52
00:06:48,210 --> 00:07:03,539
so let's say I already infected users
frustration and let's say that I have

53
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:11,250
access to test RDP server this means
that I know how the RDP server looks

54
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,039
like or services are restored but these
are installed but distrust RDP server

55
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,180
doesn't have or the confidential files I
want to access so this is clearly about

56
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:33,780
post exploitation now why are you
listening to this dog if you are already

57
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:43,979
a member or penetration tester and if
you are on the blue team side defending

58
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:54,380
your network and alright so for
penetration testers I feel really to

59
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:02,620
which you can use during pure engagement
and for duty members I will show you

60
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:11,690
some things you have to do for joining
Logan Eliza's or incident response now I

61
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,400
don't you i don't know how you approach
complex problems like this but what I

62
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,940
usually do is that I try to divide
problems into smaller pieces and solve

63
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:32,390
them and during this hack I realize that
there are basically four stops I have to

64
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:39,289
do first somehow have to drop my mouth
over RDP server

65
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:48,399
somehow I have to execute my mouth and
bypass the application but lists I also

66
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,199
have to elevate my privilege East which
I will need because of the force which

67
00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:01,810
is bypassing the hardware firewall and
during my presentation basically the

68
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:08,359
first and the four-step is important
because these are about my tools I

69
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,889
brought the second and first step is
something you can find or on the

70
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:29,709
internet now let's talk about my first
which I call the user simulator

71
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:39,979
the conflagration fire of my user
simulator and what it can do is that

72
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:47,810
basically it can simply or the keyboard
evens for the conflagration five so you

73
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:57,660
can see this is the windows run command
is leaves for one second did so on and

74
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,170
so on

75
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,260
now I need your help

76
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,450
caller for this demo

77
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:26,920
ok

78
00:10:26,920 --> 00:11:06,750
and I'm going to change also deformed

79
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:17,310
comic sounds change the color and so on
and so on and this whole tool is fully

80
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,569
comp agreeable as soon as you have seen
in the config file so you can do

81
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:29,360
whatever you want with this it's always
it is always active in the active window

82
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,519
but because you can start programs or
change between problems it can do

83
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:48,499
basically everything user can do with
the keyboard

84
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:57,679
now during this hike what I have
configured for this user simulator is

85
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:04,478
that waits for the user to connect to
the RDP server via the two-factor

86
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:11,659
authentication and whenever the user was
able to log in my mouth were created a

87
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:19,468
new screen shot and it puts in the
background of for the user and also my

88
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:24,379
mother can block the keyboard and mouse
for the user

89
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:32,539
I have to do this for about 20 seconds
or less and the user experience will be

90
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:39,739
ok now maybe the network connection has
been dropped or Microsoft rose or

91
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:47,179
whatever but meanwhile during this
twenty seconds my member can use or the

92
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:55,079
keyboard and some keyboard commands to
start Microsoft Word on an RDP server

93
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:02,079
and I can drop and ASCII encoding
payload there i buy tools can also

94
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:09,118
create a new macro code and this macro
code can be killed the US can call the

95
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:15,059
payload and dropped my fellow there and
start to buy nor is you will see it at

96
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:23,858
the end of the presentation and during
the fuel but as I said my goal is to

97
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:30,959
reconfigurable there are many different
use cases you can use it for example one

98
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:38,118
of my use cases that I can use it to
configure antivirus systems from the GUI

99
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:45,669
for example I can add new directories
excluded or even turn off the antivirals

100
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:57,089
escape is that I can install a new trust
certificates to certification store and

101
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:01,699
there is always a warning if I N story
by User

102
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:07,469
religious but my two can deduct this
warning window and accepted even before

103
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,739
the user realize that there was for him

104
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:22,319
ok so this is how I saw to drop my
member on the RDP server second stage

105
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:32,229
was to bypass popular so it's actually
quite list and the administrator can

106
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:40,410
configure it so that users won't be able
to round portable abs or but from a bar

107
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,999
downloads through the Internet it won't
be able to start because it's not in the

108
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:55,889
vilest and whenever I when I started my
research I was not really familiar so I

109
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:01,169
have tried the official Microsoft
documentation and Microsoft boss kind

110
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:08,350
enough to Tommy or the bypasses I know
and this is all from their documentation

111
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:14,869
so for example I can use create a macro
was bypassed the application by at least

112
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:21,759
there is also a very special flag and if
you put this flag into your executable

113
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:29,169
it will immediately by pass blocker
which is kind of fun and it is very

114
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:34,910
important to know that by default or D
administrators can bypass all the

115
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:42,289
violence because they are the opinions
but in my case I have used something

116
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:43,999
different

117
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:56,369
it turned out that it is quite easy to
load DLL Microsoft and by loading a DLL

118
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:01,029
I can get the same execution as by
executing

119
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:08,299
exe file you can see the code at the
bottom so it's pretty straightforward

120
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:14,640
but you might have done now

121
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:22,560
Visual Basic microsoft office Mac
romuald it's amazing for example you can

122
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:33,890
run directly shock code written in macro
code is that I mean you have a computer

123
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:43,620
you can't install anything on it but the
time using shortcodes you can run

124
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,660
everything on it so next time when you
look at Microsoft look at it like it's

125
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,439
Python or Perl because you can do
anything you want

126
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:02,360
now the first step as I mentioned
because of the force

127
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:14,020
I have to face my privileges to add me
on the RDP server there are many

128
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:20,910
possibilities hi can achieve this I can
find new local privilege escalation 0

129
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:30,950
day or I can exploit the vulnerability I
can search for for party services or

130
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,620
something else

131
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:43,750
pretty straightforward in my case I have
choose to exploit vulnerable and as you

132
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:51,670
can click on the slide this service is
vulnerable to privilege escalation if

133
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,660
you can't see this this is not your
problem I had to spend like 20 minutes

134
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:03,800
and we'll go to find this out but the
main thing is that Terminal Server users

135
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:12,629
can overwrite the executable file for
the Windows service and also every

136
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:20,680
interactively logged on user is allowed
to stop or start the service so I'm off

137
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,240
to stop the service chance to binary
darkness service and I have system

138
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,130
privileges on

139
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:37,130
actually this is very common in custom
enterprise applications because usually

140
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,710
those developers have no idea how
services were up so they just grant the

141
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:51,320
highest privileges to the services
before all of you are bought that there

142
00:18:51,320 --> 00:19:02,210
is little game for you and whoever has
the right we'll get this Rubik's Cube

143
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:11,530
originally from Hungary the question is
what is the name of the company which

144
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:29,560
published the first paper about pockets
firewalls 1988

145
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:43,679
yes I will give you the cuban the end of
the presentation the answer is so there

146
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,710
is this very restrictive Harbor firewall
between the client and the RDP server

147
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:56,320
and the problem is that I was able to
drop my member on the server I cannot

148
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:03,530
get my shell because if I do a bind
shall I can't access it because the

149
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:09,060
firewall view pocket if I have my
reverse shell it won't be able to come

150
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:15,330
back because of fire for people I cannot
use and covert channels like DNS

151
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:25,460
tunneling ICMP ipv6 UDP I can't use
proxies everything is blocked but I

152
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:35,380
still need CNC channel for my shots have
been able to do that my first idea of

153
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:44,780
the after my members dropped in my fancy
communication IBM mark every packet to

154
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:53,780
be special so let's say I will put the
magic had to all of my communication and

155
00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:02,250
my mother will be actually containing
Karen on that will filter driver and

156
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:09,560
then afford this kernel module sees that
the traffic has this magic had or it

157
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,200
real

158
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:20,210
basically extract all the communication
from the TCP flow and it will allow it

159
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:27,090
to my bunch sitting on the RDP server
and the problem with this approach was

160
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:33,189
that every hecker application had to be
rewritten or even rerouted through

161
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:41,240
customs broker proxy so I said this is a
no go I don't like this idea and my next

162
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,370
idea of us that

163
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:50,929
but if I used the TCP source port to
signal to the network here talkin or

164
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:58,410
bribe her on the RDP server that this is
a special network traffic it has to be

165
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:04,350
treated in a special way there are some
limitations with this approach like when

166
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:12,419
I'm not is used it won't be able to grab
but I don't care about this one if you

167
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:19,300
want to implement this on a Linux
machine it's very straightforward and

168
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:27,300
easy is just one line of iptables called
so let's say that if the TCP source port

169
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:33,909
is bomb free free summer and the
destination port is SSH port redirect

170
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:43,440
all the traffic to my bank shower which
is listening on 313 for asylum it is but

171
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:52,790
what on Windows so this is how it looks
like I said the TCP source port on the

172
00:22:52,790 --> 00:23:02,639
client I will conduct to the RDP port on
the Windows Server but because my kernel

173
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,000
module is running on the infected RDP
server it will see that this is a

174
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,679
special traffic and it's real rerouted
to the bank shall on the RDP server so

175
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:24,750
let's say that I'm not sure if you are
into Lord of the Rings reservations but

176
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:32,800
let's say that this is the num stateful
firewall and he and his friends are

177
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:42,139
still checking all the packets but there
are to allow the dishes into the city or

178
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,809
not but because they are looking only at
the door on the content they won't be

179
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:54,940
able to see that there is a back door
and the traffic and after the

180
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,460
the firewall or the communication the
back door traffic can be separated from

181
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:09,070
the Army Peter so as I said on Windows
there are no iptables so it's a little

182
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:18,820
bit different and harder to do and it
turned out that Windows 64 platforms I

183
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:27,990
need the trusted signed drive or in
order to install my can imagine but I

184
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:37,880
have found this great project and what
they are doing that they are basic they

185
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:47,230
have developed kernel driver which is
the find trusted by all the computer

186
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:56,770
Microsoft computers and I can write my
own code and my code will interact with

187
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,950
the signed kernel driver which is
amazing I would say that this is how you

188
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:11,080
bypass or the magic in design process I
realized I was lucky that I have found

189
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,870
this great project but there are also
other ways to bypass this can damage or

190
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:24,050
signing limitations for example the bus
but guarded by US I'm not sure if it's

191
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:34,090
still working or it has been passed or
what I really liked that mother rootkit

192
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:44,189
it actually in stored kernel driver from
virtual box which was signed by Oracle

193
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:50,950
what kernel driver I think it was a
buffer overflow or something so it

194
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:58,010
loaded the kernel driver windows check
desertification and digital signature it

195
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:05,370
was widely applauded it and after the
rootkit was able to use the buffer

196
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,750
overflow to run colonel

197
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:16,140
codes on the machine I think it's
awesome in expression could be ok I have

198
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:22,750
to said the TCP source for source port
for communication I can I do that turned

199
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:32,910
out that the night cat from the field is
for your it's here to rescue me and this

200
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:40,650
is all I have to do to reel out on my
communication with PCP source port set

201
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,810
about this

202
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:56,379
Harper Firefall by scandal

203
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:10,250
this is the server side where I start my
bun cha cha port 3337 and I also start

204
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:19,300
my kernel driver and it says that port
1337 which will be the magic TCP source

205
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:29,730
port and this is the TCP for sport and
it's connecting to RDP port 3389 then it

206
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:39,640
has to be redirected to my bank shot
which is listening on Freeh's on the

207
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:48,960
client side i SAT my TCP source port and
I contact to the RDP port of the in fact

208
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,760
its server are my current drivers
running and as you can see the

209
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:02,590
communication is up and running and
looking at the kernel of all I can see

210
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:10,220
that from the special TCP source port it
was going to the RDP port and this is

211
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:18,040
the same as a hardware firewall PRC
between the client and server so it's

212
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:28,430
totally legit but if I'm not looking at
the kernel of all but on the userspace

213
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:34,500
this is what I say that the or
communication is between the special TCP

214
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:44,190
source port and my bank shot there is a
trick here because it's just an average

215
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:51,000
TCP communication it works so it was
back and forth it's a persistent

216
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:03,700
connection from now

217
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:18,190
different for example let's say that you
have observer and you already have admin

218
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:24,980
privileges on it but you can have your
persistence CNC communication because a

219
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:32,760
firewall box it you can use it and so
it's pretty funny actually because of

220
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,450
you read the news that Kaspersky has
been hired by a nation state at the car

221
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:46,769
we did so they were using something
pretty similar in their favor also using

222
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:54,710
this network foot or car and driver they
used the trick not my TCP source for

223
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:01,220
trick but actually it's the same but I
have implemented I'm not sure who has

224
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:12,330
implemented it first i order but also
instead of forwarding my communication

225
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:18,668
to this server I can use this machine so
hope to attack on other machines in the

226
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:26,889
DNC or even if the firewall is not
restrictive it's a very good way to hide

227
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:34,250
the traffic in the fireballs because if
the five road mister Darcy is that there

228
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:40,610
is a lot of communication between this
host and legitimate service on the

229
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:47,639
machine it was say okay that's cool but
if they see a special ports like my bank

230
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:54,158
Charles Davis I own this is fishy and
they can go after that so it's very good

231
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:01,309
way to really hide and branding

232
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:12,289
so let's recap or how the whole attack
works I in fact the client with my mom

233
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:17,759
and my mother waits for the user to log
into the RDP server via two factor

234
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,249
authentication it creates the screenshot
from the user desktop it shows it really

235
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:28,909
user also disables the keyboard and
mouse or the user upon be able to

236
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:35,919
interact with the machine for that
twenty seconds my member Bill Trott and

237
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:44,720
asking cue the payload into the RDP
server it will start Microsoft trade the

238
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:54,369
Democratic code and Demetric could feel
the correct order and by using this

239
00:31:54,369 --> 00:32:04,100
thing I can bypass the Microsoft aplicar
local listing I can escalate privileges

240
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:11,799
to Mystery Tour love by using this
vulnerable for service I can install

241
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:20,499
driver I can drop my meter predator I
have my shots this is how it looks like

242
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:29,610
I can connect to leave work station and
by using the special TCP source port I

243
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:37,879
can connect to the allowed RDP port
connection which will be redirected on

244
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:51,480
the RDP server to my buncha and I think
in action

245
00:32:51,480 --> 00:33:02,260
this is the attackers you I am
connecting to the client I'm setting up

246
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:11,240
some port forward magic which will be
used later and if I start calculator you

247
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,740
can see that discouraged or start on
this machine so this is the infected

248
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:27,070
bomb which is in the background and I
have dropped on my number two was so I

249
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:39,810
started on the infected machine and the
RDP server I want to and I feel used

250
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:51,970
these temporary folder to drop on my
mother to us because the user is already

251
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:58,480
logged in to this RDP server via by two
factor authentication my mother can

252
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,360
start the matter is running on the
client but because the RDP is the active

253
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,889
though everything

254
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:13,990
types and similes the keyboard events it
will be active on the RDP server so it

255
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:20,908
can start involved

256
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:34,970
after that it tastes like 75 pages of
skin called the payload there it will

257
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:43,959
create a new Mac recalled the macro code
will extract on my minor payloads from

258
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,480
the scan code is payload and it will
load it

259
00:34:47,480 --> 00:35:00,240
the LA Kings Creek and here are on my
work as you can see I have started my

260
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:09,430
interpreter bind show on the RDP server
and I have also started kernel mode

261
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:40,770
driver ID's and from now on

262
00:35:40,770 --> 00:36:01,690
client

263
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:09,460
the RDP server on the RDP port and it
will be redirected to my bank shower

264
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,150
running on the RDP server and here you
can see that the communication has been

265
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:21,360
set up and in the user mode I can see
that it's coming from a special TCP

266
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:28,020
source port 1337 and it connects to my
bike show but the harbour firewall sees

267
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:39,290
that it's an RDP traffic because at each
layer is just at the party people are so

268
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:47,720
I was able to connect to my to the RDP
server and I have my shop on the RT PCR

269
00:36:47,720 --> 00:37:05,740
have interactive remote code execution I
can upload and download files

270
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:14,660
hold on just showed you it was like five
minutes and it was pretty easy to see

271
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:20,160
for the user that something fishy is
going on because something started and

272
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:29,330
now let's see what the user really sees
if he gets attacked this is the user's

273
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:38,480
desktop icon next to the RDP server and
now we see is that the keyboard and

274
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,020
mouse is not working and things oh my
god

275
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:51,369
windows sucks and I'm gonna call support
on the head

276
00:37:51,369 --> 00:38:06,840
ok everything that's just fine and I'm
able to connect the RDP server and do

277
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:17,540
whatever I want so you're ready members
penetration testers you have to do to

278
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:27,779
use during your post exploitations the
first two is you can drop in to remove

279
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:36,570
that post I was told that separating
some functions from the user's it's very

280
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:41,450
secure if you use Remote Desktop to
separate this Mickelson through Remote

281
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:48,669
Desktop can in fact from the client to
the server and I just proved all these

282
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:57,650
guys also if you have admin privileges
on windows with my kernel driver you can

283
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:09,500
bypass or Harbor Fire bourse which is
pretty useful in restricted scenarios if

284
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,990
you are on the defensive side you have
to know that every additional layer of

285
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:18,700
security at your network can be bypassed
no matter what

286
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:25,240
it will take more time for that occurs
my be that it's not enough to hack your

287
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:32,328
company because the neighbor is more
easier but you have to know that there

288
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:37,800
is no such thing as my hundred-person
security everything can be bypassed and

289
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:47,320
as I said remote desktop it is a real
interface former foreign faction also if

290
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:55,760
you install next-generation application
protocol of our firewall is that all of

291
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,720
these damn stateful firewall it can
catch this attack because it will be

292
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,230
able to see that this is not an ordinary
people to call this is not an RDP

293
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:12,410
communication I'm gonna drop it you have
to know that this can be bypassed as

294
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:18,140
well I'm gonna show it to you right now
and last but not least you have to know

295
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:30,220
that you shouldn't trust your firewall
logs blindly because it can for you

296
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,319
that alright alright we are secure we
have in store this next-generation

297
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:41,720
firewalls we have configured it looks at
the RDP protocol so it will block your

298
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:51,799
attack and I said ok I'm gonna buy
passes and it turned out that got us

299
00:40:51,800 --> 00:41:02,050
through our programming interfaces and
by using keluar I can wrap my CNC

300
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,619
backdoor communication so it will look
like

301
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:17,819
RDP terrific

302
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:34,230
starting my bike shop

303
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:48,820
and clear but whenever I look at the
virus what happened it will look like

304
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:56,869
just playing RDP terrific not like that
at all so if there isn't as Angie

305
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:02,830
firewall between clients and servers it
will see all this is just a deep RDP

306
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:20,930
traffic I will allow it so you not cut
and you are and I

307
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:28,140
user same rate or harbor firewall bypass
module smartass ploy possible use so you

308
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:35,290
can just grab from her page and use it
in Metasploit whenever you sessions and

309
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,100
it will be just easy to use

310
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:46,650
so basically that's all I wanted to say
to the first two killings are the links

311
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:53,210
to my get her pages you can see my work
email you can connect with me on

312
00:42:53,210 --> 00:43:00,880
LinkedIn or you can follow me on Twitter
I have also uploaded all my previous and

313
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:12,609
current slice to lunch are you can also
see my hand and last but not least if

314
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:20,040
you happen to be depressed I really
recommend you visiting activity because

315
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,640
it's one of the best I T security and
hacking related conference I have ever

316
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:37,980
been that's all folks hope you enjoyed
it

317
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:51,150
any questions

318
00:43:51,150 --> 00:44:02,660
can define my own channels and yes I was
when I started my project I already knew

319
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:09,290
that this can be avail to do that and I
know a project who did exactly the same

320
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:17,620
thing but I wanted to create my to as
general as possible so for example my

321
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:27,609
son I just RDP it works basically on
every desktop interface so using

322
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:38,240
channels would be faster on second or
something but it won't be as generique

323
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:50,830
but yes it's possible and there is a two
on the Internet to do that thank you
