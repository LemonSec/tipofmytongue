1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,829
alright then Craig Smith this stock is
going beyond

2
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,539
August 14

3
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:22,050
techniques are not going to go into a
little details of some of the CAN bus

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,859
network type things there's plenty of
places to go look at stuff up you can

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,149
like we mentioned before there's a
cantankerous handbook to free book I'm

6
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,170
gonna get it will give you all those
kinds of details but we will go through

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,780
the process of how you about such a car
I need to expectations on a car what are

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:47,159
your goals and I'm gonna talk about to
neutrals and there are a few overkill

9
00:00:47,159 --> 00:01:12,330
but they're so see if I can get this guy
but never

10
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,990
area

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:20,298
it seems to be working now so we decided
on attack are all cars are different so

12
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,649
depends on your years as a featured you
have present a modification stoit

13
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:30,039
package you got the tram anh the good
stuff so if you're working on your car

14
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:34,460
or if you're working on an engagement a
lot of engagement for automotive

15
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:41,520
companies you know you're gonna be given
certain car and so you basically have to

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,310
figure out ok with this car have areas
am I going to attack that's you know

17
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,890
your attack surface you wanna feel your
goals are with threats and risks are

18
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,090
there and then turn the payload you know
what you're going to do once you get on

19
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,959
a car parking cars isn't really the
heart it's pretty simple as a couple

20
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:13,160
unique pieces that make up the car I
hired to defend the heart attack

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:29,859
let's do it through this live now says
she's on top of everything

22
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,060
so you think about the attack surface
it's more than just know my application

23
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,190
stuff they've never done any application
threat modeling if you like that you

24
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,340
simply looking for inputs these inputs
are things like your form fields there

25
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,510
are a lot of our parts of some kind of
data input your application you busy

26
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,590
just treated car as an application so
your employees become a more varied get

27
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,890
input from other vehicles from sensors
you get them from you keep you get them

28
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,220
from it has wireless or Bluetooth
capabilities have physical inputs as

29
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:13,060
well you have to see around you may have
USB connectors you know you have the

30
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,620
connector in your car on OBT dongle
those just playin if your steering

31
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,570
column you see in each check both use it
for that and depending on who your

32
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,310
client is physical aspect me out a lot

33
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,640
presence of your client is something
maybe they sell taxi cars or three squad

34
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,630
cars where the wires from the back seat
become very very important so I can get

35
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,680
these network wires from the back seat
you can do a whole lot of damage to

36
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,880
vehicle so don't think just because its
physical it doesn't matter does matter

37
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:54,690
just starting out and you want to start
with the physical to wireless and you

38
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,709
can identify different on your vehicle

39
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,900
nowadays the comparison become more
common with a means is that used to be

40
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,190
these were like one office each vehicle
have their own kind of thing was kind of

41
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,930
custom built for that vehicle when I
first started in this 2008 the

42
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,950
attendance center that was there also
known as I V eyes but my view I was mad

43
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,789
unit and the process fraught with a
Hitachi a 64 processor and was running

44
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,820
into CEO which you know where
identifiable but processor I didn't

45
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,349
really know a little bit of googling
turns out that was the same processor

46
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,450
using a Dreamcast which is really cool
but didn't know how to write assembly

47
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,700
for Dreamcast but that doesn't take long
to kind of get past month

48
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,650
nowadays on the internet that the new
systems are times are in tow

49
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,239
arm things are pretty comfortable with
their running Linux running you know so

50
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,360
when the CEW Qnexa Green River makes 12
but you're when you're on when these IVI

51
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,080
systems the billing define and execute
isn't super challenging it's actually

52
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,570
the same kind of stuff you would do on a
normal desktop you know your code now

53
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,420
sixty 60 you can test your code and what
you're going to be on your desktop

54
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,080
before use it on when he's not systems
so the only real barrier to entry to

55
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,770
getting all of these attacks just for us
really talked about yesterday about

56
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,450
getting billion test bench do you get a
retirement center you can get one I

57
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,349
recommend one from tyson tyson's nice
because it's open source hardware I

58
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,240
thank them for software as well I P were
using to develop their entertainment

59
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,620
centers this is a no but you can kind of
pick my directly for whatever pieces on

60
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,390
campus as you want it features you want
you just buy it they give you the full

61
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,210
depth studio the same one that the art
of people using it about Devon a lot of

62
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,239
times it's a good one kind of your
bearing on test about breaking anything

63
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:10,490
I recommend tyson's and then once you're
on which is typical I guess I want you

64
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,280
on the OSU C 00 here is it's as an
access point you know that played some

65
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,770
wifi which is running like used APD life
and asymptomatic into version number

66
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,859
compared to see these these things
really get updated you be kind of

67
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,430
disappointed to not just gonna hard
challenges not simply just mapping

68
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,390
versions then sign ok this is vulnerable
as a known vulnerability for it by now

69
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,240
you've heard what I want to do and this
is going to depend on what you really

70
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,410
want to do or what you been hired to do
your pelo could be that you get on the

71
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,420
IDI you're done maybe you're just there
to listen

72
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,780
on the microphone admits limousine
service and dedication happens in the in

73
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,950
the back a limo is very important to you
to make your games over there in the

74
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,920
context of a Bluetooth connectivity
Bluetooth phone contacts synced

75
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,160
something going for me came with your
cell phone you can liberate the car

76
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,420
companies just on the surface all and
that's going to be working more on the

77
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,130
vehicle's network typically from my
engagements that's using your prefered

78
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,630
concept is going to go from as far away
as possible to working on the car

79
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,580
actually controlling the car the city
controlling like steering it can be

80
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,120
unlocked in the car and driving car way
those kinds of things you walk up to a

81
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,000
car

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,010
read the benefit that unlock and started
she's a pretty good demo now is that we

83
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,190
need to go for another possibility is
refreshing the firmware sometimes if

84
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,000
they have it there are a lot of them
don't but if they have these that

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,780
sometimes the trusted source on the
network so they may have some validation

86
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,479
you know when it's getting the update
you know over there that ok I got this

87
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,470
piece the update we're gonna push it out
shout to my other hardware components

88
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,270
that are inside my car sometimes there's
no checks between the IVI and the other

89
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,120
former components there is technically
you know these security access codes

90
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,030
they just put in before you can reflash
but the idea is trusted will do it for

91
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,359
you so if your performance trainer
someone who wants to reflash maybe don't

92
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,570
have the key here don't have the money
for the key copy and I V I open may give

93
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:39,010
you access you want a little complex and
that they're so can we talked yesterday

94
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,030
as the most common when I think
everybody tried before getting into this

95
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,339
bill to start with

96
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,590
that's what the sniffer is available for
CTF challenge the cancer forget john the

97
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:54,120
CAN bus now controls a lot of things the
other bus is constantly slide

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,920
Dennis line when is a very popular ones
a very simple

99
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,660
bus protocol is very cheap and you can
see some they suffer from the seat area

100
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,000
you may not be able to talk directly to
land mines not use exposed gonna come in

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,720
say underneath your be done but we can
control it about time space for the seat

102
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,930
warmer let's just say you were to send a
message you can you can send one that

103
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,979
you want to see it goes underneath the
seat itself and then that can versatile

104
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,550
in that actually told the heating in the
warm-up so just because you're not

105
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,819
directly connected you bring up some
kind of wiring diagram you're looking at

106
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,839
it doesn't mean you can't control it it
just means it's going to eventually go

107
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,820
to another protocol and you may view and
a tap into the wire more directly you

108
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,910
may be switching from that can something
else in the screening policy must that's

109
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,350
the kind of the red one of the top now
and I don't worry about too much it's

110
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,620
pretty much just use for high-fidelity
sound and entertainment and stuff

111
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,000
another we might run into a complex
right so expensive I wouldn't start

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,380
their scars and hacking stuff goes but
it's good to know they're gonna think

113
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,230
the sides can you come up to speed the
CAN bus that kinda stuff again when I

114
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,420
can go into all the details of this is
another one by one on how to carver say

115
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,260
it's going to be the exploitation of a
focus on so you can look at the pulitzer

116
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:20,089
your online Cu details of campus itself
to some complications when you're

117
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:26,990
talking can I that if you have that such
as one of Canada's sale would say does

118
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,519
rpm is going to come off like to say
what every millisecond just going to

119
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,880
don't sharpens its astronaut of course
but it's just going to come out over and

120
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,670
over and over and over and over again so
as an attacker and he zeroed attack that

121
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,469
when you decide you've identified what
the RPM speed this flooding the bus

122
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,569
going to send a bunch of that same
message with maybe a higher speed and

123
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:53,130
said you can talk faster than the real
messages talking you when they are

124
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,230
coming to go up whatever happened to
still having won the competition is

125
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:06,160
still having the real system tell it
like 25 and you're like 25 75 height 75

126
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,689
and so

127
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,490
noises of looking like the real controls
the noise in the problem is that because

128
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,580
you can't shut that other guy off your
still gonna have that noise and if the

129
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,200
speed is of the communications quick you
have to be quicker that guy can be a

130
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,060
tough very noisy on the bus

131
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:31,540
eat up a lot of bandwidth to attack it
that way every make and model is

132
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,180
different so if you find out that ok if
I hope my goal was to unlock a car door

133
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:43,120
maybe you have a Honda and for your 2013
Hyundai you know this particular packing

134
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,840
a lot card or well not want to slip into
GM's vehicles or you have a BMW it's not

135
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,730
going to work the whole different I D O
different bites with can you don't have

136
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,570
a source and destination you just have
this idea is pretty simple but there are

137
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,540
different for every car that's easily
done to come to give a competing managed

138
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:11,010
thing I wasn't very that's arguable but
thing is that there are different they

139
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,580
sell the information other people
allowed on a bus and you have to figure

140
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,730
out you know what is going to attack you
may have to be concerned about yes

141
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,240
systems currently vehicles don't have
ideas they're working on the thinking

142
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,760
about it but let's assume their own
eventually be there what would you have

143
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,260
to do to kind of bypass that I think it
through this one thing they can't afford

144
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,430
tool called cannon fingers you can get
passes vehicle detection but taking

145
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,479
advantage of the fact that because he's
making models different you can use that

146
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,000
to your advantage so what you have you
know every card and every year so

147
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,790
oftentimes have slightly from packets on
it you can then use that information to

148
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,680
determine like oh well on this type of
car from this type of car because it's

149
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,630
going to be different so something I was
normally a challenge for getting on and

150
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:06,030
forget how a vehicle works mention of
you tack you can use that against nice

151
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,329
thing about this is you just do this by
monitoring the wire you're not going to

152
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,750
generate any kind of traffic
traditionally how this is done as you

153
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,840
query the

154
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,920
main ECU and ask for the VIN number and
then you could do something like Ben

155
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,719
decoding your basic look at the first
couple blades and forgetting ok with us

156
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,390
the gym as you know whatever you can
eliminate all that there was an idea

157
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:35,330
that query don't like queers let me know
squaring the day the element that is if

158
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,250
you happen to be on an IV I i dont like
this because I V I kind of look around

159
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,540
the ABS system very least she's a splash
screen that was a lie condo or something

160
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,930
and that you can plot data that way but
sometimes just not on for AVI sometimes

161
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:55,839
I like a tome action just smaller model
model it's a little better system so you

162
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,330
can still use cannot finish fourth at
this it will use on the research side he

163
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:06,340
wouldn't run this on like after an
attack you don't get onto machine and

164
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,190
then run you read this you're developing
an attack this is part of you building

165
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,360
out your exploits and so I apologize for
being too hard to read but he left the

166
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,350
way it works is it would take that
sample said you can't see it too well

167
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,800
here but the first several bites tell
works as these IDs at the top and you'll

168
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,079
see that these counts and so they say
like 98 99 78 99 78 and there's a drop

169
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,810
of how many times it's all those I think
around 400 and something in the drop

170
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,810
again and that's based on their
repeating them out on the bus so how did

171
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,930
they are also takes into consideration
most immersive to certain intervals so

172
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,599
if you take all the ones are said to be
a certain amount shouted miss you group

173
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,500
those the ones signs will call this
common IDs there then we look for as we

174
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,920
look at the packet size that's what some
brackets there the packet sizes up to a

175
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,069
buy on some vehicles this is always
invites they do this by adding about

176
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,820
this particular example there's
something you can see there are two

177
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:11,060
bites and therefore by it and there was
no padding we call this one dynamic if

178
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,979
its static and eight then we also detect

179
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,800
adding it to the pedal zeros did the
cattle are raised all access all these

180
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,490
things go to make a fingerprint and then
there's some Jason that's the alcove

181
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:25,889
this

182
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:31,509
house here normally runs deep of
feelings this is the verbose output we

183
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:35,480
always get this this Jason Beaubien in
this case the same gonna make model trim

184
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,439
because we've been given a fingerprint
database and then it's kind of saying

185
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:44,358
you miss out on the common IDs will give
you mean aidid that it thinks is the

186
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,939
best one to use

187
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:51,049
gives you the mean interval in this case
at the very bottom number it's like 00

188
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:59,339
died 9 2009 so I used as an attack when
you make a show you want to run on the

189
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,249
system's if you're on the right system
in this case I would listen

190
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:08,449
02 milliseconds buy seats who are the
main ideas during that point zero two

191
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:13,319
milliseconds I you know I'm most likely
on it and I don't see it I bailout it

192
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:18,299
don't make any network traffic I stopped
I can do additional checks during the

193
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:22,259
because there are patterns out and about
the same time even though the meaning he

194
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,790
doing that point zero two milliseconds
ships in the other comment i'd used as

195
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,279
well as so I can check them off my list
that takes me literally point there two

196
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,600
milliseconds to do this tax is in very
very quick I can really tell without

197
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,649
creating any traffic what kind of system
ought to have two pillows made her way

198
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:44,889
to unlock a car door on Honda when this
radio is also sold on a call Jim Brown's

199
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,540
I can then have a stake a statement so
at that point there two milliseconds I

200
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,559
can identify what kind of car online and
then jumps the propellant so intriguing

201
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:02,160
ideas beliefs on the network level to
use the fingerprint database piece you

202
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,049
simply take the Jason Powell you add
information to it and then there's a

203
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,918
function that kind of attitude at a base
in this example code here it's just

204
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,429
giving this is the one that test
directory it takes a sample data base

205
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:18,110
camp and database of one fingerprint a
federal law that says Honda Civic 2007

206
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:24,109
not discussing 92 hybrid and there's
information it gives you a confidence

207
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,199
level so how confident that things that
is in that match this one is still just

208
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,250
on the research side

209
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,470
yourself to see if your daddy sorry has
the information reports are different

210
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,330
that you need to know it's the
equivalent of figure out like I had sex

211
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,510
but that works on this version of
Windows what else is at work on its the

212
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,590
same kind of things you would do other
tests feeling ok well it kinda cars can

213
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,889
I make this work on and you make your
expert that was extra bonus feature get

214
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,169
the fuck outta fingers it's a it's a
pattern matching system it's not very

215
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:03,080
verbose is just kind of added as last
minute but it's kinda fun pattern part

216
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,449
is this be the top it's like a little
lower case the capital be there to speak

217
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:17,020
of a movie and isn't just bit changes so
this could be off on off on off on or

218
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,230
like and maybe doing locks so that would
be unlocked lock unlock unlock unlock

219
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,169
and lock lock it's a pattern that you're
going to trigger and you're going to

220
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,580
tell kenna fingers a look for this
pattern and all this network traffic is

221
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,389
flowing through your network and the
town of it and as you do those commands

222
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,760
it will pull it out that's what the
example is there a look at the logs

223
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,379
there is serious in this case to make it
easy to see the big changes are between

224
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,169
0 and one can find it anywhere and
they'll say look here's your matches can

225
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:48,679
find more than one match that would
match this pattern given it and it says

226
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,000
okay with this I D position by position
six over the two days I saw toggle

227
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,260
between a bit state was most cases here
in 10 between 627 whatever this is just

228
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,990
there to save you time this has nothing
two finger printing is just since I was

229
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,289
already analyzing the data less add
something extra and so when you're

230
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:11,710
trying to figure out things like okay
well well lots of car what controls if

231
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,630
it's a bit I'll call you can control you
can justify a couple seconds just a

232
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,690
little bonus feature

233
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,970
so where I get it from get home if you
check get her back home / Samba Craig

234
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,560
that's my get repository there's a bunch
of can utilities and their conf is the

235
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,820
kind of fingers the Ruby package so if
you have installed you can do a gem

236
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,830
install cos I don't solve the
command-line tools and also the library

237
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:43,500
so if you want to incorporate this and
some other kind of broader system this

238
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,710
is particularly use on

239
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,750
can so you're gonna use it probably on
Linux don't know if you can use anywhere

240
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,310
else

241
00:19:51,310 --> 00:20:00,730
necessarily for your research stuff but
he's not then stopped at Everett is

242
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:09,170
called management this is actually
written for reporter for NBC we have

243
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,450
this love-hate relationship the media
need them the kind of get your message

244
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,460
out there and talk to play people but at
least the ones the cameras really went

245
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,220
really sensational stories in logic
don't talk to me unless I have something

246
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,810
demo that's super scary so I hate scary
demasiado I am just not a fun person I

247
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,090
want to go out and talk about fixing
problems outrageous can help people so

248
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:38,189
it it it's a little tough yeah so I
create this the the store here it's

249
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,600
about that for cars essentially what
this is it so you can set the remote

250
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,570
control model cars at once from anywhere
in the world

251
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:52,780
way it works is you know what you think
it would work you have a car that goes

252
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:58,129
up to a web server and polls for actions
he has to be there because the cars

253
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,070
network is always a great can be a
little time so it doesn't pulling a

254
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,080
tribute to what sort of anywhere and
then the attacker was controlling the

255
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,870
vehicle sits on the other side and the
energy commands so when the cars connect

256
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:18,879
to do the things not that easy to do
what we can do is watch live at the NBC

257
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,350
video did decent job I don't think this
morning too much when I can watch the

258
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,409
whole thing we're gonna watch just let
the democrat the tool works and a little

259
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,860
bit from Josh Corman from my mcalary had
talked about it and then I'll stop it

260
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,909
study released today shows just how
underprepared automakers are to deal

261
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,510
with the threat of cyberattacks that
right now a lot of people are talking

262
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,920
about it but tonight the item is
actually going to do something like

263
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,299
gloria also teamed up with a bona fide
auto hacker and wait until you see what

264
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:55,049
he was able to do with the vehicle from
thousands of miles away side this garage

265
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:04,059
on Seattle's South Side our break Smith
is tinkering about 10 bucks for sale by

266
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:08,320
plugging a wi-fi or cellular dongle
under the steering column of this Mazda

267
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,149
he's replicating a potential security
risk in thousands of cars all brands

268
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,100
that have factory installed wireless
communication using the same signals

269
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,219
that would normally be used by the
vehicle were just now controlling them

270
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,059
from the internet after deciphering the
computer commands that control this

271
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:28,910
car's headlights and wipers he gave them
to me

272
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,410
3,000 miles away here in New York City
the car is in seattle is the command for

273
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,340
the lights I'm sending it and see if the
lights on the car turned on and the

274
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,770
codes work headlights are on

275
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:45,889
that's amazing 3,000 miles away I just
turn the lights on in the car and the

276
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:51,210
switch on the inside the car is off just

wheel nor is He behind his computer up
in the air like a no hand I'm the one

controlling these lights the lights are
turned on nobody's in a car crash

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,820
outside the car lights just turned on
and I control the wipers to this is for

280
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,820
the wipers are good at the wipers are
going and 3,000 miles away and and I

281
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,689
just turn the wipers on software
controls controls your lights and a

Joshua Corman is co-founder of I am the

283
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,710
cavalry dot org a group dedicated to
raising awareness about the vulnerable

284
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:28,010
software in lots of technology including
cars one person scares me the most is

285
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,299
now there's parking assist teachers and
a lot of these cars as a very powerful

286
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:35,010
motor on the steering column it's more
powerful than you are

287
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,230
can often be used to rip the steering
wheel out of your hands while you're

288
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,809
driving

289
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,559
Mazda sent the i-team an email stating
the company is aware of the growing

290
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,678
concerns related to the possibility of
vehicle hacking and continually works to

291
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:55,480
improve the security of our vehicles are
you know I think this is what are the

292
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,279
rules is that you know this is this is a
general general thing that picking on

293
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,139
the car companies and that's one reason
is that special Dongguan major the

294
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:05,699
reportedly showing me attach a weird as
done with the bottom of the cars it's

295
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,580
like really a problem he modified the
car that was intentional you don't

296
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,658
necessarily have to as I just explained
you put this on the IVI systems or

297
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:19,269
whatnot but the point was the pic on my
list I bothered us about this but

298
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:20,659
whatever it is what it is

299
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:25,740
it could've been worse but you will have
to deal with that if you're going to

300
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,749
Emmas for people this is how the
software works on the details so

301
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:33,990
whenever you make your relay peace and
so that's the piece is gonna run on

302
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:40,600
telematics or on your payment or a
little dongle dongle later if you will

303
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,090
but it just goes out the website is a
polling question pass then or any kind

304
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,840
unique lady right now just used to kind
of separate cars from each other I don't

305
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,320
use the code or anything like that kind
of figure out on the server side working

306
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:01,869
hard as he could think of the method
supported so the response to the first

307
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,850
three is premature what the result will
did you have waivers on off lights on a

308
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,490
flash and then good flight rpm and fuel
just getting a democrat of unit proof of

309
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,860
concept deal and when we went southbound
reporter sat down with her line online

310
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:24,039
login and check this out he looked at it
so yeah I was just picking up a little

311
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,249
harder doesn't look really about a
correction I think it sucks to contrive

312
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:30,780
to make it look a little more hackers

313
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:40,010
ok I had a Kansas and Kansans stop her
from her to Linux can Utilities is the

314
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,060
same syntax for that can man is not
really that commando because it actually

315
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,370
will flood with whatever you get it as
we have two seconds and stopped looking

316
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:54,629
for a crash have a problem with saying
something else too contrived make it

317
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,710
exactly the way I said to make it kind
of those the definition of contrived but

318
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:07,280
I can orders but it is easy to use but
it proved that that's what they say it's

319
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,790
Ajax not returnable look like it is
taking on terminal it's just a website

320
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,100
is a test kinda do the terminal
emulation of just a simple PHP back in

321
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,530
as you know some stuff you'd expect the
intermol apparel support you know you

322
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,639
can hit the control you and all that
good stuff those credentials can have

323
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,920
multiple logins from multiple different
people I currently don't really see

324
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:35,600
people logged into the system I don't
really use the system so that it hasn't

325
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,520
leaked madrick capabilities and basic
scripting capabilities I'm you can

326
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:47,690
assign the numbers two variables to
group them and see if its tributary

327
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:55,600
groups said than done yet that part so
it could be a vehicle's it's going to be

328
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,889
kind of like an array gonna work then
save this episode had to assume you're

329
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,110
saving it won't save the to a backhand
service I'd state right now chat log out

330
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,590
if it is just that session or yet but i
think im gonna save on the server side

331
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,300
there that's going to add a some
geolocation stuff so it has the

332
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,980
capability is a feature to say like the
location of the vehicle that would be

333
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,440
kinda grateful to have the DTC
diagnostic trouble codes your engine

334
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,210
light and you know you can have problems
with OnStar which was kind of fun and

335
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,260
scary kind of way so

336
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,390
release this yet and I have been
debating about it I don't think I'm

337
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,450
going to America can't tell you enough
to build it yourself if you really have

338
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:50,420
a really good reason to get this could
be really convincing you can contact me

339
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:57,750
we can work on something that isn't a
real solution for this yet so I don't

340
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,930
really know what I'd be getting out of
this time by released in stores up

341
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:06,650
pressure him to do anything to fix
anything really just for demo and even

342
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,800
if I never did again I did it once and
that was it so I mean if you really want

343
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,889
I'm probably not the only source code to
this so I can be done I mean

344
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,710
unfortunately is not a whole lot that
can be done as individual users we

345
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,960
really have to rely on the auto
manufacturers do a lot of the stuff but

346
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,160
the trash Carmen women do his recovery
little speech there and I really support

347
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,030
I am the Calvary it's a great group it's
just a bunch of security who get

348
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,710
together if you've heard of them to kind
of work with some industries LA Times

349
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,950
internet things kind of people to come
learn the lessons learned from something

350
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,810
or a no sew for manufacturing in server
side stuff just as opposed to reinvent

351
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:55,169
the wheel on redoing the same problems
we saw before LSU lessons learning and

352
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,130
just jump to the end of the fantastic
they cannot last year this five-star

353
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,590
cyber safety program it was target for
the automotive but really kind of place

354
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,870
and Internet of Things just like safety
by design

355
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:13,469
evidence capture all that good stuff for
it was releasing any have Internet of

356
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,390
Things device you can't do these five
points you're not production ready when

357
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,070
it's simple you can update over there
you can't help the Modified I mean these

358
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,840
are common sense things we wouldn't
attaching to the Internet like a web

359
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,449
server things and so why are we texting
and the other device

360
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:36,010
the plane speaker their speaker talking
something else is just controls on cars

361
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,030
coming to your failures on the sky how
their safety standards are males

362
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,740
whatever so please speak was just an
aside for that

363
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,100
easier to understand

364
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:54,219
gonna get involved where you know some
stuff publicly and openly or with any

365
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,570
kind of group and calorie needs more
than just hackers and with his interests

366
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,260
in the stuff and doing PR whatever it is
you're free to reach out to you the

367
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,690
site's founder garages are supposed to
me about us bringing the book at and has

368
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:18,610
a Twitter handles for the 2003 that I
can book that's on one side the 2014

369
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,229
crackers and manual it's a little late
on information in my opinion and that's

370
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,220
because story behind it was that this
book was written to go along with a

371
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,970
class at the USCC nice a cyber challenge
class and so is their training manual

372
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,669
but it went with a whole day talk I have
had cars so they get this before so it

373
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:42,679
seems like it's missing details it's
because it was in the other part I

374
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:48,299
released it open source for free it in a
setting up my ISP the system and where

375
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,889
we had three thousand dollars in the
first four days and from all over the

376
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,440
world and shut me down and I realize
that people want to do this or they're

377
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,429
really interested I had no idea the
interest until book kind of came out so

378
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:09,230
I started over another one that can be
done as far as the writing partners and

379
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,100
begin the year but on this expressive
gonna handle this one the first one was

380
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,879
self-publish miss our special and it's a
lot bigger over three pages or something

381
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,720
but it goes up you through all these
little pieces this is like this which

382
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,000
happily out the new one we can go
outside town tax step-by-step how to do

383
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,620
show all that good stuff it will still
be free so also be a free book

384
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,699
negotiations I don't know when I'll be
out I was hoping to be able to Chaka

385
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:48,460
Khan ago not ready yet I might have some
samples out we'll see so

386
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:55,000
reason this is mine my questions time
period slide but i wanna have to grant

387
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,490
he's gonna give you information it's
more like to challenge the way on many

388
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,450
factors for the most part work right now
is when they're working on vehicles the

389
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,040
stuff they're working on the new stuff
isn't going to be out for another five

390
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,860
years

391
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,360
their cars are done in 20 the very very
design I'm not my make modifications to

392
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,600
the done so as a security researcher
that obviously is rather frustrating

393
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,010
think that over we're telling them
something the best things about twenty

394
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:31,260
20 best and I but the current state of
things and so some you have to be aware

395
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,860
of and because of that kind of stuff
because the old traditional way of being

396
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,020
nineteen acted that responded to a
five-year turnaround the time they're

397
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,760
not always not always friendly to you so
it's still at the stage it helps to know

398
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,860
how to get information to them so if you
start doing this research start finding

399
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,790
vulnerabilities and you can become a be
worried about concerned Scherzinger this

400
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,990
research because they want their car sea
antes find something they want it fixed

401
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:05,340
and that's always are we just want
things fixed so right now it's a go die

402
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,949
mcalary drivers to you find something
let us put you in touch with the

403
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,980
security teams at these other
organizations greetings typically get it

404
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,250
and they typically not have to take this
information in kind of walk it through

405
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:23,680
the right people and their lawyers after
you enter their help desk it will most

406
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,560
likely go right to the layers but you
get the security help we're working on

407
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,929
getting several factors that have
responsible disclosure policies to the

408
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:39,340
very least you have an email you can
send to that would be great don't expect

409
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,689
in ninety turnaround time

410
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,210
parties area it would be I don't I don't
think you couldn't shouldn't demand I

411
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,580
need around here but it's just the board
have one yet

412
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,149
down the road I think the absolute
should I thinking on the Internet should

413
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:57,340
but they're not quite there yet just so
you know I think that is a good goal for

414
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,120
them to get there but they're not there
yet

415
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,989
I would say within the last year is when
they start to take security seriously

416
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,790
and the car from what I've seen plenty
of research in this we've done damage

417
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:14,529
wirelessly before I'm partially at least
five involved last four years but I said

418
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,590
last year as I can be raised or perhaps
security teens unfortunately they're

419
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:23,700
doing the same thing that we always the
ramparts we always do when we're

420
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,939
starting out there taking this closed
source group they're attaching it to the

421
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,080
internet icon that we need security
let's move on to other departments and

422
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,340
then your security team and we doing a
situation i mean you're you're you're

423
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,640
just one department onetime mayor the
scary teen

424
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,389
you do have active people looking for
vulnerabilities in your vehicle you

425
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:50,790
panic attacks do you want to go buy
something you know what to do now and

426
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,509
financial industry where birds eclipsed
by the latest was being thing that

427
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,620
helped me do my job I'm a little
overwhelmed the problem is there isn't a

428
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,930
whole lot things to buy but there's a
lot of companies scrambling to fill that

429
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:07,480
need and I was at the rather half-baked
at best a lot of the solutions

430
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,750
becomes are seeing money has the same
any signs of people willing to throw

431
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,570
money at the problem and fortune I think
they're gonna probably brought the same

432
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:20,780
things are very scene they're gonna do
like firewalls IDS systems it's probably

433
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,810
not a good solution and I talked 2013

434
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:34,040
bypasses 2024 already broken so you know
I think we need a little more work kind

435
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:41,000
of do lessons learned this is my number
and where we actually higher security

436
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,730
people who can do real testing you can
do it you might have to reach architect

437
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,020
some of the stuff most segregation
that's in there is based on speed we

438
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:55,340
want this bus got busy we made another
bus based on functionality based on

439
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,640
security the part that connect them just
random but not really you know you can

440
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,000
put files in a missing don't ever do if
I don't ever do intrusion detection just

441
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,240
that's nowhere near the level you need
that's the piece just like you have any

442
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,209
regular network

443
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:16,030
today it's just there like you know it's
you know so far but it doesn't really do

444
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,180
much so

445
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,899
same thing will happen of course not
gonna do much safer ways of releasing so

446
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:27,250
far been on the OBD dunkel part so you
can blossom pieces there is not enough

447
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:32,380
stuff you can do it myself using sensors
have a lot of sensors my personal

448
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,170
opinion is the security pioneers have
you looked at more as we do our human

449
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,760
stuff so you have five senses and it's
easy to clean my senses you know but

450
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,750
it's hard to travel 50 miles and that's
really what you have to do to really

451
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:50,340
pull me out of my brain off of my senses
cars have a lot of sensors right now you

452
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:56,780
wanna bust the rest of your pretty easy
just taking over a descending ideas use

453
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,450
other sensors to make intelligent
decisions await your see all right now

454
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,419
hearing that stuff and kinda having a
just of how the industry works seeing

455
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:12,990
some of the newer kind of tools that can
be used and exploitation I'll take any

456
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:27,040
questions you guys have

457
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,580
tolerate limiters yes the question
performance training and eliminating

458
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,450
really matters i personnel to the
performance tuning side of open ground

459
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,660
around this is a community that anybody
can join I started initially thinking

460
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,750
the security people can hear that cars
and when I learned from the day one of

461
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:52,220
the first meeting we had I was scared I
showed up we had a bunch of accounting

462
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,560
show up but reforms to show up at our
people show up you want to do some

463
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,370
Burning Man stuff and i'm looking how
there's a bigger need for like the types

464
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:05,359
of information that wherever digging
into so I couldn't personally tell you

465
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,350
exactly how to do that but I did we do
it it's typically done at the firmware

466
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,980
level of understanding with the ECU but
again I don't do that please visit the

467
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:21,180
rumor but there is a prominent changes
and so they need password to do that I

468
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,129
do that part

469
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:41,910
help with the password to get to the Cu
but then I don't do the printer genius

470
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:48,779
questions like a CT scanner for security
there's there's actually talk about that

471
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,339
right now I didn't let the video player
way through but there's a senator that

472
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:57,710
comes on right after that we had a
proposal and it wasn't a bad proposal is

473
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,839
just doesn't having teeth I guess you
would say things in his life

474
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:09,150
third-party security audit about
statement true but like who's checking

475
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:15,910
out where the checking for some guys as
web apps in the car does good stamp that

476
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:21,058
we have to have that listen as a
security group and generally don't have

477
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,390
that we don't have the same class
patients for vehicles that we have a

478
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:29,170
chance to say oh this is seeking
injection thats this level risk princess

479
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:34,650
to say if I were to do so it's a
combination of gain entry to a car can

480
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,069
you can you can gain so far as this
level wrist now like if you were tell me

481
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:43,779
what the expert was I can't tell you how
bad I you it is OK from where this the

482
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,010
unlock the car doors are still something
ok it's here or maybe even amplifier in

483
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,520
the car and I get you down like your
house maybe it's a bit lower water break

484
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,319
through the windshield ok technically
you did it but you know I just and so

485
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:01,440
like i bug bank problems have a problem
to classify it like you used to say like

486
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,230
over these types of tax will be $20 for
the car were still at the stage like

487
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:11,740
will I know its security I just ended up
in to rate word label that people in

488
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,160
kind of class other stuff that I think
maybe once we kind of work that I would

489
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,970
reply me soon we might be moving forward
on doing safety rating that stuff for

490
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:25,259
this in their safety standards for sure
the ISO 2626 to as a think on a stool

491
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,920
standard ASIO but it's really based on a
park fail so I can purchase this part

492
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,440
fails at six miles per hour

493
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,599
how bad is it based on how many people
could die die will do recall how that

494
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,390
works

495
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:47,839
yeah yeah just a few people died and so
that the change will have to be like one

496
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,270
is that it's not just a part failing
it's the part still working its working

497
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,870
maliciously Picasa pivoting

498
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,810
stuff doesn't come into ISO 10646 to the
starting to look at addressing that now

499
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:05,240
so I'm safety is only deal with that and
if you have over their updates we don't

500
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,000
really have to do this long-term recall
recall has been stagnant it anyway so

501
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,530
this way if you are to find a
vulnerability and reported maybe we can

502
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,830
shoot for more than 90 day thing where
people have the divers I just tell you

503
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,319
there's a problem seems legit and you
fix it either some there's some

504
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,500
complications for fixing it then you
have to do a lease the same kind of

505
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,540
encryption you do on the phone update be
awesome to do other things you wouldn't

506
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,620
have to do you would have to do an
update for you wouldn't want to do an

507
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,720
update with him is driving you don't
know if they want to make a year or two

508
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,109
ago trying the car to go to work please
wait for an hourly update your

509
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,250
signatures that would say something to
do to make it right but they're easily

510
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,650
overcame we've done it before in other
areas and we have to do it again on cars

511
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,310
so I think once again have those in
place that'll be a little bit better and

512
00:41:52,310 --> 00:42:17,690
then I think we'll get better safety
standards and get them or TV

513
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,220
right well as well as the five surviving
humans can be played anything connected

514
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,589
to the European Plain Dealer medical
device or whatever I mean you can't do

515
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:32,520
those things you're not production ready
I'm not making speculations of Air

516
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,440
France disappearing before I disappear
think I'll leave that off the table they

517
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,230
ever the same joke made with cars and I
hope was beside the wire wheels on

518
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:50,870
vehicles and skip the ground and that's
fairly accurate i mean the bases network

519
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:58,060
on wheels that's what the are you can't
really as an individual right now where

520
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,150
would you put it so like for instance
figure back to the the picture of the

521
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:08,600
network stuff there is sometimes there's
choke points you know maybe you could

522
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,799
put it choke point depends what you're
trying to protect areas but these are

523
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,580
buses web US workforce so everybody else
is packets if you're on that same bus

524
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:28,020
segment so difficult and the reason why
hand is this way because it really has

525
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,960
to be very fast very efficient to give
you information so you know you want to

526
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,650
babysit him breaking anyone that
information right away and so it has a

527
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,320
lot of CEP in form of eliminating noise
that you would normally see and i cant

528
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,110
packet but not so much in my life as a
break when it wasn't the brake

529
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:49,220
controller saying something like that so
if you're going to Fire Island here like

530
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,120
maybe you put down or something plugs in
to prevent like ballet attacks or to

531
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,140
make sure that the preggers progressive
dongle that you put in doesn't get hat

532
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,140
or something like that and you could see
a certain risks segment something I was

533
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,710
honestly it's a knee jerk reaction that
doesn't really solve a greater problem

534
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:09,110
encryption and I wanna hear a lot like
bullets and bus doesn't help you you

535
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,800
know I'm going to have a much larger
amount of packets being sent to say

536
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,040
you're breaking and it there's nothing
secret about that packet I mean yes I

537
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,029
can forget what breaks you know what
this bite unlock my car door and yes I

538
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:27,170
use the propellers but personally as
someone who likes to tinker is rather

539
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,660
when I bought my car did you give me
that information

540
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,069
my mind is my car I love to know my car
works without having to do this stuff I

541
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:38,369
love to have the wiring diagrams
included in my owner's manual and

542
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:42,849
shouldn't your subscription thing I
don't like those things I like to see

543
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:47,609
those things fixed I never will be but
you know there's there's movement to get

544
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:52,890
some thats effects I was involved with
the Copyright Office recently are you

545
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:59,980
for class 2122 the DMCA exemptions if
they go through it was kinda give you at

546
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,440
least more leniency to be able to talk
about things and share stuff right now

547
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,510
is really questionable a document like
all the packets in a certain vehicle

548
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:13,619
does are sometimes sold for 125 grand
power to take that one file and publish

549
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:20,970
it but I but in reverse engineering will
they come out nobody's tried it yet

550
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:27,029
GMs said they would do something like
that so I believe him but I don't think

551
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,280
I should be able to do it I don't have
knowledge that people should have so I

552
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,470
think we're coming to head never needs
it

553
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:38,118
this genetic diagnostic kind of piece
that's missing pieces of the OBD

554
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,690
connector is a standard connector thing
to standard diagnostic for the read only

555
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,940
you know it's a read only thing I go
with my current speed or you know how

556
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,849
are things looking but if you wanna do
something complex I see have a pickup

557
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:53,710
truck and you to carry more weight when
she's out that acts on it you have to

558
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:57,789
change the firmware on the vehicle so
you can deal with the new partitions

559
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:02,839
rushers dahmer's gonna be off shipping
is going to be off that's not a read on

560
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:07,960
the operation and order the stuff you
have to have a single level access so

561
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,140
it's it's coming ahead I think those
exemptions will go through and maybe we

562
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,480
can go a little further on the tinkering
part and open communication piece we're

563
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,349
used to that the software community just
having a communication with me just say

564
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:25,490
things and you know I couldn't it isn't
attacked it's not horrible and vehicle

565
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:29,020
but it's not great either of these still
will attack you at the show not totally

566
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,359
cool with working just people on the
street

567
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:36,779
nevermind I think well you know we don't
know the CPU testing we know we're doing

568
00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:42,260
you shouldn't touch it actually doing a
little bit further and said that in

569
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,260
their case like

570
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:51,000
the claim that software is copyrightable
all to pieces and I'll be shipped in the

571
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,350
vehicle's round software there's an
implicit copy rate GMM jerk are you

572
00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:01,720
don't do they decide to go ahead and
make a statement and so they're

573
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,189
definitely afraid of course I think for
most people that's news to them at the

574
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:10,120
page you know thirty thousand plus and
we don't want that car so hopefully

575
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:20,660
we'll win that by

576
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,848
so the question is there a way to
disable the wifi modem that kinda stuff

577
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:29,140
there isn't an official ways they do
that i mean I'm seeking cut the wires

578
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,240
and that's what I recommend

579
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,149
be fantastic I mean they don't be
shocked if you disconnect and remove yer

580
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:42,180
people but it's fine if you remove the
OnStar

581
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:47,089
call you even for not paying that
service that allows detecting a problem

582
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,940
her car bringing in for free service
jack because they want the answer there

583
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:56,099
there so you're not paying for it they
they wanted in there so right now

584
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:05,220
they're definitely not on all search for
it would be nice to have I agree I think

585
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:15,709
we're projecting while driving is
illegal but I didn't have anything else

586
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:29,140
that is I don't think it's legal
question

587
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:45,720
that's changing and I was like 13
processor their update was honored DVDs

588
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,319
and so if you were to buy a mapping DVD
for two hundred and fifty bucks he could

589
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,990
have the ability to put your software on
it that's actually I got in I saw these

590
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:59,939
deals and stuff and that's remaining
modifications to my splash screen and

591
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,220
bunch of other things actually shooting
get music video entertainment that's my

592
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:10,259
goal but that's what they used to work
in the honestly didn't use the update

593
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,349
the OS and we had a pretty major to be
on and I think as I get somewhere over

594
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:18,609
the air and something big of a deal
you'll see more of it on BMW recently

595
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:25,940
did one where there was a vulnerability
found over the air update which included

596
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:31,250
not using encryption but did a good job
and it was brought to them by a

597
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,599
third-party researcher who said it and
they had sex I think within the nine

598
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:39,079
days my memory and and they pushed up
and down the pics the encryption peace

599
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:42,710
and that's that's why I wanna see that's
fantastic

600
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,789
to some people I think one of the
stories came out of course is the news

601
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:50,460
and I like BMW had but it right it's
just support me that's going to happen

602
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,240
we're going to find a way you can make
it in there but you do everything right

603
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,258
you have encryption all that stuff i
mean get hurt leader something you

604
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:06,450
updated on take off work every day to
thrive in their daily needs to a

605
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,799
dealership so my mind there's no other
way to do it attacks are forced to have

606
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:16,240
a remote update the rewards very
interesting on so I hope to see more

607
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:25,870
right now I'd say

608
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:37,859
they asked thanks

609
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:43,750
I returned I hope so

610
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:48,900
Tesla doesn't have the texts and the
same kind of development cycle begin

611
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,630
with so they started their friend which
is just kinda cool I guess when you can

612
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:58,840
be kind of like that when you're like a
startup thing but it will be tough to me

613
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:04,130
that's a huge mind-set that they have to
change their their machine since I just

614
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,250
keep running making business decisions
and that's the way things have worked

615
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,580
for ever wear them because it was
physical these were closed network

616
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:17,020
attached the internet you don't have to
worry about but the game changed in the

617
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:21,250
past them and they attach some ways it
in realizing the United the phone home

618
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,510
systems have an IP on any possible but
unlikely we heard you in the collision

619
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:30,360
like ours as an IP appealing at least
your wife obviously has it there's

620
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,390
obviously where this was getting into
these systems which puts them on the

621
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,819
same game as the servers as cell phones
and you really do need the same

622
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:44,280
turnaround times so least those aspects
of software aspects to be shorter than

623
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,960
just happened I don't know if I'll ever
do it for design perspective five years

624
00:51:49,960 --> 00:52:00,339
it'll be a huge change and other
questions

625
00:52:00,339 --> 00:52:05,119
I gotta get well thank you for time play
the CTO get a cancer different a curse
