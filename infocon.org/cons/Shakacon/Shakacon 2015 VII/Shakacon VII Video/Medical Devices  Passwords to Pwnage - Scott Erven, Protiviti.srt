1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,930
good morning

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:20,920
thanks for having me back it's always
great to be back and why what I do

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,820
associate director perpetuity we're
specifically medical device healthcare

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,130
security full time as a consultant also
I'm security researcher some research

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,500
that i'm gonna be presenting been
looking at it for quite a long time

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,280
coming up on for years over three and a
half years now actually focusing on a

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,699
medical device security research have
just over 15 years experience and idid

8
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:51,349
security have spent over five years in
industry data provider managing security

9
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:58,210
programs or is there anyone here that
actually works in health care hospital

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:10,680
stay out of the bottom two you want to
follow me to about medical device stuff

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,630
you wanna shoot me a question offline or
something like that to talk to a brief

12
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,869
briefly what I'm talking about today is
you know first you know why am i

13
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:28,400
involved in research while my compelled
and driven to this area where my focus

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,710
on this area what does it matter to me
and then not talk really briefly for

15
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,949
those you that weren't here last year
I'm gonna give a quick synopsis of some

16
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,009
of the earlier phases research which was
kind of high-level what type of device

17
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:47,460
vulnerabilities be seen and then also a
quick recap on the internet exposure

18
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,669
stuff that we covered that are covered
last year went over direct medical

19
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,560
devices sitting on the internet as well
as healthcare organizations that

20
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,670
miscalculations that exposed thousands
of medical devices to direct attack

21
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,790
vectors

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,690
the third gonna release new research and
his first time we're discussing this

23
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:15,040
talking about this and this is
essentially a release credentials for a

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,920
large device manufacture hundreds of
credentials are gonna release and show

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,070
you the Associated CBS was about 25 to
30 °c bees that reserved over the last

26
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,739
nine ten months for this part of the
research then finally we're gonna kind

27
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,770
of short up really briefly with some
application security stuff show you is

28
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,610
that a problem you can probably guess I
don't have any report wasn't and

29
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,880
diagnosis and treatment plans where
we're going what progress is being made

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,859
kind of with all the stakeholders
researcher to manufacturers to you know

31
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,180
regulatory agencies at the AAA those
folks coming to the table what we're

32
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,880
doing so first you know how do I get
into this right I think everyone in the

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,700
room kind of has that personal impact
with medical devices and is anyone here

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,488
that is a medical device diabetic
insulin pump anything like that that

35
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,430
that you know use these devices airlines
devices even if they don't or you don't

36
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,019
personally you know someone your family
member is probably affected at some

37
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,810
point or you directly at some point of a
hospital and end up being connected to

38
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,670
Nicole I said that were more frequently
is connected to the network

39
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:43,548
secondly for me you know my personal
impact why I got started when I was

40
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:51,220
working in healthcare there was a big
focus on there has been a big focus on

41
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,320
you know hip and patient privacy and
protecting patient data in not that I

42
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,820
wasn't important but as I started to see
these devices become connected and

43
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,530
medical device integration kinda taking
place that we can take all of these

44
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:13,130
critical devices and analyze real-time
data and threw it into big data devices

45
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,609
that typically work connected or not
connect

46
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,000
and security has kind of been an
afterthought on a lot of his legacy

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
devices it was something new devices as
you'll see have issues and so for me

48
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,370
being in health care really was looking
at the healthcare organization's mission

49
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,440
in and saying every single help your
organization is going to talk to some

50
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,130
aspect to patient safety and when I
looked at it and was like ok let me

51
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,380
focus on your patient privacy or pH I am
protecting that and again that's

52
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,310
important but I also thought it with
these devices getting connected directly

53
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,169
touching patients right and if there's
adverse events or intentional or

54
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,770
unintentional consequences due to
security controls that are in place that

55
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,969
could result in adverse event that
really ties into the core mission of

56
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,840
everyone that works in health care and
so that's kind of where I got my passion

57
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,900
for you know digging into this stuff say
can we find some of these

58
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,479
vulnerabilities can we work with
manufacturers with regulatory agencies

59
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,010
to get some of these things salt and
that's very rewarding when you do that

60
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,250
it's much more rewarding than you know I
saved someone's record from getting

61
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,419
stolen because you are dealing with
adverse events potentially you no loss

62
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,799
of life when you deal with something
medical device malfunctions another

63
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,450
thing that I want to kind of went out up
front because a lot of people will

64
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,630
immediately when you start presenting
this you know they'll kind of throw back

65
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,440
to out there although throw well is
there a documented case which will talk

66
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,760
about that later but I also want you to
think that malicious intention not a

67
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,570
prerequisite to an adverse event patient
safety issue 2 story that goes along

68
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,490
with this is a year or two ago there was
a risk to patients that were admitted to

69
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,810
a hospital in Austria Austria and they
presented for for gunshot wounds and

70
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:19,320
preg fragmentation wounds I don't know
how they got shot and grenades thrown at

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,320
him but anyways they were they were
hooked up to a patient-controlled

72
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,800
administration infusion pumps that's a
little one that you can you can click

73
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,990
they felt their pain

74
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,330
wasn't under control they wrote that to
their caregivers the nurses the

75
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,460
clinicians attention they felt otherwise
so what are these patients do they went

76
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,820
online they found documentation they
figured out hard coated credentials with

77
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,620
administrative access to these punks
they figured out how to change the

78
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,380
dosage levels and then suffered OD side
effects so that's something that shows

79
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,010
like it doesn't necessarily you know
everyone in this room probably

80
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,539
understands that yet we could have an
attack on these devices

81
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,290
it's not that difficult securities poor
but even if you don't think that know

82
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,680
that there's not a prerequisite to an
adverse patient safety you and the

83
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,550
patients could actually cause harm to
themselves as well so what are we doing

84
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,130
generally myself you know others that
are kind of working in this area medical

85
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,800
device research it's really again
focused patient safety issues I will

86
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,510
cover some privacy issues in the talk
today certain things how I think you

87
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,840
know medical data stuff like desk in
actual traded out but it's really

88
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,950
focusing on patient safety issues and we
hope that most of these as we address

89
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,140
patient safety issues and use that as
the core underlying objective for

90
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,430
security that many of those patient
privacy issues will be solved by the

91
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,900
same controls that we put but if we if
we drive it by fission safety we think

92
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,799
we're going to be more effective than
looking at it the reverse way that we

93
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,930
can't have historically over the last 10
10 10 years of coordination and

94
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,780
notifications are very involved in the
research we do you know working with

95
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,830
providers using that word out

96
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,740
also working with device manufacturers
of their affected working with FDA I see

97
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,420
a surge in you know reporting disclosing
vulnerabilities that we find and finally

98
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,070
it's you know inoculation and its
awareness to providers is awareness to

99
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,080
technical security folks other technical
detail level how it's working with

100
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,580
regulatory agency with the FDA and you
know providing our import our voice of

101
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,669
you know technical literacy on security
to those regulatory agencies that are

102
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,700
willing to listen and the FDA has been
absolutely great over the last 12 to 18

103
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:38,000
months very open door policy talk to
them on a regular basis and you know

104
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,340
they're they're they're they're really
trying and so we can't just step away

105
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,080
we need to be part of the solution we
can just call it out I don't think

106
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,490
that's really effective so that's really
you know for me one of those things

107
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,640
where I feel I need to be engaged and be
part of the solution not just part of

108
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,650
saying that there's problems so quick
recap on one slide

109
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,949
high-level most of the vulnerabilities
that you see the first one that you see

110
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,810
is weak default hardcoded credentials
that's gonna cover today when I release

111
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:16,089
credentials and all of that year you're
coming in a little bit later seconds

112
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,320
known software vulnerabilities so a lot
of these devices run legacy systems they

113
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:28,210
aren't the latest and greatest almost
every hospital that I'm in I mean I

114
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,090
should say every hospital in still has a
few devices in place many of them are

115
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,270
sp2 they're not patched this is common
belief or push back that you'll get when

116
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,050
you talk to providers there when they
try to get these things resolved to get

117
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,069
pushback from the manufacture that they
need to go through recertification

118
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,630
process with the FDA

119
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,290
very clear from the FDA since 2008 but
that doesn't have to happen unless

120
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,300
there's something that actually changes
the clinical care inside of the software

121
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,680
that delivers the clinical care what
service security clause has been in

122
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,650
place since 2008 but you do have to push
back you're going to get that answer and

123
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,680
you have to push back in order to make
progress I can tell you when you do push

124
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,000
back it'll eventually get to the right
person at the organization and they'll

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,710
start to address these things the third
one is unencrypted data transmission so

126
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:26,720
this is something at first you may say
okay that is one of those patient

127
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,110
privacy issues right interception today
to those types of things and yes that's

128
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,990
absolutely correct there's a lot of
systems that don't use encryption oh

129
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,390
sure one example and again the
application security section about this

130
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,420
but

131
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:47,110
the patient safety aspect is that
certain devices are sorry about medical

132
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,430
device integration products what those
do is hook up to the devices they act as

133
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,138
an interim then they popped out over the
medical record most of those systems

134
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,579
that are in place in healthcare
organizations right now don't use

135
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,870
encryption when they do that so you can
sit in the middle

136
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,519
see what that traffic looks like don't
use authentication upon pat down or the

137
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,010
use a hard-coded prudential the pump
down into into the actual medical record

138
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,389
and so you can alter those data stream
so if you get older data that ends up in

139
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,560
the medical record you know that's what
potentially look at patient safety

140
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,369
issues it would be no different than you
know there's been plenty of research

141
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,070
that's been done on you no adverse
effects due to medical identity theft

142
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:34,510
when someone presents as you for
treatment and missed diagnosis

143
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,410
mistreatment you know being prescribed
the wrong drug those tapes outcome so

144
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,360
that's going over this one can you know
potentially have an impact of change and

145
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,630
look at patient safety not just patient
privacy space to this is what we did

146
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:55,920
last year I worked actually with another
researcher sean murdering her and we

147
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,219
give a further detail talk DEFCON last
year we did some work on shown anyone to

148
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,670
look at internet basing my exposure and
initially we're just gonna look at

149
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,140
devices sitting on the internet so did a
search for anesthesia and boom I get a

150
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:17,810
hit and showdown well I know what you
know medical devices look like and what

151
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:24,589
banners and others look like and so I
could clearly tell me she's right

152
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:30,040
the only indication that I could have
potentially been a medical devices that

153
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:37,099
it was running XP but I'm not I i knew
that this wasn't a medical device when I

154
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,760
said we don't get this thing running SMB
and it's actually has anonymous

155
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,810
read-back in Active Directory
infrastructure and is giving us

156
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,839
hostnames Dallas intelligence on its
internal network including medical

157
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,540
devices

158
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,390
so that first one that we have found
that we showed last year a very large

159
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,760
healthcare organization had over 12,000
employees over 3,000 positions very

160
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,920
large cardiovascular neuroscience
institutions are show you just a big

161
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,140
recap of this organization how many
devices broke out kind of mentality is

162
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:16,600
here a little bit suppose you know
intelligence on 68,000 systems and give

163
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,540
direct attack vector to this system from
the internet it also exposed third party

164
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,620
organizations in healthcare system so
there is indicators inside of their many

165
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,060
health care providers will use
third-party lab services or radiology

166
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,550
read radiology reading organizations or
services and so there is indications of

167
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,300
systems with well-known labs or
radiology reading service providers

168
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,900
inside of these data sets as well so do
we find just one of those organizations

169
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,540
that we showed you last year no we found
hundreds and it is only the search

170
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,439
queries inside a showdown in order to do
that and you can see over on the right

171
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,310
there is kind of the number it's that we
got so we were looking at coordinating

172
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,930
with this open what you know it had
health in its name that clinic in the

173
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,020
name and so there you see there's
hundreds of them once you start going

174
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,550
into specialty clinic name so if you
start doing urology or podiatry or

175
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,160
pediatric you end up with potentially
thousands organizations that had this

176
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,290
miss configuration on external basic
systems are provided this intelligence

177
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:27,180
so here's a summary of the devices
inside that one organization that we

178
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:33,150
found that this system is misconfigured
provided attack vector into direct

179
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:38,420
attack vectors OMB was open and as I
said it was also an XP box it was

180
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:48,060
honorable 2008 067 which guess what
happens to be a zombie so you're so that

181
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,979
a large cardiology institutions are you
see that cardiology systems that were

182
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,380
associated their computer systems are
using pumps using pumps as well as

183
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,250
backend server infrastructure that
pushes out you know drug libraries those

184
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,880
types of things

185
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,110
tax systems this is an interesting one
I'm going to release some credit here in

186
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,680
a bit on some of the pack systems but
taxes what pacs is for those not in the

187
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,650
health care industry this is radiology
imaging storage essentially that's where

188
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,550
all those images for all your devices
rouge et or x-ray or MRI systems is

189
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:32,719
centrally stored when we looked at
initial device vulnerabilities tax was

190
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,570
one of those in almost every case when
you would go into the application you

191
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:44,200
would have a unique login password to
the application but the installation

192
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,130
manuals

193
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,100
very thorough and so when you try to hit
the back in storage system on the

194
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,850
network to IP

195
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,760
operate in there wasn't an NTFS
permissions on the devices so you just

196
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,800
walk right into the storage others that
we found dead have passwords but they

197
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:12,750
were weak or hard coded and so you can
go find those online like I did you get

198
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:18,600
into the system so this is a big way
through major way that attackers are

199
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,280
able to get into healthcare
organizations one and two you know

200
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,790
actual trade you know pH idea for
reserve those types of things

201
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,610
pacemaker systems to differ you know
there's so many here there were a

202
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:41,500
pacemaker controllers those types of
things so that attack vector like what

203
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,690
attacks that we have right with a
physical attack if you wanted to walk in

204
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,350
this information and showed you the host
name of the system it shows you in many

205
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:55,380
cases office floor number that was then
and it was like 20 are seven other type

206
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,750
of device so told us if it was a pack
system that was something to do with

207
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,500
cardiology has something to do with
their medical records system we also

208
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,260
need like if they had lockout exemptions

209
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,770
physical perspective because eighty
value would be set to zero to override

210
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,119
and that would come through that
Anonymous read through the Active

211
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,290
Directory that was wide open yet
phishing attacks

212
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:22,849
that you can use here you still have all
this information once you deliver that

213
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:28,939
payload much more stealthy right so you
know exactly the host names of the

214
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,100
systems that you want to attacks if you
want to go after their medical records

215
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,310
system you know every service around
their medical records every system there

216
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,460
was running backs you every system was
doing cardiology you knew that this was

217
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,940
anesthesia cart know are seven so what
you got that foothold you could go see

218
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,380
an entire network very had all that
intelligence limiting that was the thing

219
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,810
like I said it was external facing
vulnerable MSO 8067 so you wouldn't have

220
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:00,389
to send think you could just put the box
externally

221
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:09,380
writing mystery alright so I'm talking
about disclosure timeline

222
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,470
out there before I put these up early
studies so this was disclosed initially

223
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,460
at GE Healthcare back in mid August last
year also sent ICS search but a week

224
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,260
later they handle disclosure process
September 16th and into disclosure so

225
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,740
did initial batch of a brown hundreds of
credentials and then in September few

226
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,480
weeks later I got a little more time
went through a little bit more do more

227
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,130
documents and something about another 30
to 35 cents credentials and I see a

228
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:46,690
search in December that's when i receive
a response back from ICS sir that GE had

229
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:55,000
completed their investigation also wanna
know that although I did choose to

230
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,990
disclose this and coordinate this
disclosure this information has been

231
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,060
public four-year sitting on their
website doesn't require a login or

232
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,659
anything it's just sitting out there on
their website publicly already but

233
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,970
because it's your medical devices and
has that potential in that patient

234
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,160
safety aspect obviously

235
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,510
research I'm doing I chose to still go
through disclosure not release it

236
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,910
publicly right away so that responsible
play into it

237
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:27,980
GE is actually

238
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,600
presentation and you may think oh man

239
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,149
GE really has a problem this is a
systemic problem across the industry

240
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:45,059
could pick any manufacture and and give
the stock G is actually one of the I

241
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,990
would say frontrunner as far as
developing a competent security program

242
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,190
there's a few of them out there any GE
Phillips medtronic they're all doing a

243
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:59,120
good job you don't see that stuff the in
new products for many years the

244
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,280
development lifecycle it's along with
medical devices are so it takes time to

245
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,379
do it but GE was very responsive they do
have a good team Mike Moreno Mike

246
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:17,440
maria's so Mike actually comes from
Accra background and he's he's already

247
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,230
you know like their their cybersecurity
in their response to your efforts so

248
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,809
they've put a really good team together
they did you their investigation there

249
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,870
for a response back the DHS was that all
these credentials are default not

250
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,309
hardcoded so we'll leave it at that

251
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:39,790
and shows the slides after the show you
some of these credentials that are some

252
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,960
variances what that potentially with
that statement I'm not gonna argue that

253
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,770
statement they went in you know they did
their investigation that's what they're

254
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,230
what they're saying but also some
discrepancies with their documentation

255
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,490
to where you know customers wouldn't be
treating these things as default or it

256
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:05,000
would be very difficult to change these
types of credentials so your ego here's

257
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,870
the first one so on these slides gonna
be a lot of fun so you're all ready for

258
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,178
the slide madness here don't read them

259
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,610
passwords down on paper and going to
fall off

260
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:27,928
do you see this going to this is a CBE
is going to be the spin reserve that

261
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:31,940
will be released tomorrow probably when
I tell them to go ahead and publish

262
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,610
publicly now that we're talking about it
you know something really quick right

263
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,169
CBA 2006 what's got have you been
holding onto these things in disclosure

264
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:50,350
for the last nine years no that's not
the case how this works with disclosure

265
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,360
is we're using documentation as I said
that was publicly available when you go

266
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,580
through that process you look for the
first instance of those credentials in

267
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,970
the first instance of that documentation
that was published publicly and we

268
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,020
revert to see you back to that year so
that's where you're going to see

269
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,120
different discrepancies different years
so I chose to go back because I

270
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,149
understand health care I know there's
lots of XP lot of old legacy devices I

271
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,830
went back to 2009 go before 2007 from
2000 and up to current and you'll see

272
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,520
various yours come in here and not just
legacy devices CCD is from 2014 that the

273
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,650
updated documentation that was put out
was a month for five weeks before I

274
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,840
started doing this so it is newer
systems as well

275
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,570
format you'll see manufacturer model
version type of device type of account

276
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:49,070
login information for this one just kind
of point out you know these aren't all

277
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,270
most of these these aren't physically
you need to have access to these devices

278
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:58,200
over the network management services
administrator accounts on Windows box is

279
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,540
those types of things now we know we can
get to these devices are you get a min

280
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,940
access right now this is how you do as a
year ago as you know telnet accounts

281
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,160
admin accountants those types of things
is a nuclear imaging systems by the way

282
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:19,120
they are again also very interesting to
point out when you look at these

283
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,959
different products and you start seeing
the passwords how these passwords are

284
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,280
kinda like shared and bounced across
multiple product lines and multiple

285
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,668
years right kind of came out so this one
is 2013

286
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:50,379
here we go again as you count nuclear
imaging CT systems going this one is

287
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:54,459
interesting here this is one of the
indicators that you'll see fairly common

288
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,190
to hear on the bottom so easy when BNC
login so you can see another example

289
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:06,679
show later using PC anywhere for support
with awesome passwords but definitely

290
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,159
probably would have been quicker for you
to try to crack these actually doing

291
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,350
control efforts search for password in
the documentation on some of them but

292
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:23,209
these are gamma campus nuke imaging we
go again different version Millennium

293
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:30,200
series here

294
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:47,510
logins for CT scanners see that same
password venues across every version

295
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,190
right

296
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:56,740
you need to take a break come back miss
admin the search started in center city

297
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,320
system so now we're gonna start getting
into packs imaging devices that I that I

298
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,409
was talking to you about so this is the
application again say they're refusing

299
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:12,280
credentials across these various
versions of these devices are right here

300
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,810
some backend database stuff so it's
tough to tell you about getting into

301
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:21,720
these facts systems which showed you
were supposed not necessarily Jesus

302
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,060
taxes in general you how would you then
get into a single data is supplied this

303
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,159
or this one sequel not even a password
required at all

304
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:39,690
sequel database so you want at least
this one this is from 2014 this is a

305
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,210
good indication they actually have an
SSL key manager which is the project is

306
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,320
actually capable of using encryption
which is good

307
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,510
unfortunately if you need to get into
the into the key stores for those SSL

308
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,520
keys those types of things there's your
login info to go ahead get into a

309
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:04,870
compromise certificates in C Class A
logins this is interesting this is the

310
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:10,500
analytic server done this in 10 Dundas
is so big data stuff that utilize so

311
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,810
this is gonna obviously have treasure
trove of patient information and data

312
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,760
and sitting in these types of systems so
it's kind of big data analytics systems

313
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:33,520
PACS systems PACS systems this is known
as I was mentioning earlier on how many

314
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,129
of them don't have a lot going to get
into the back in storage

315
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,340
well she actually does have a login but
there's the user IDs and passwords both

316
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,850
the readonly log in and read right

317
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:56,219
more packs more packs more packs as i
log in some of the web server interfaces

318
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:06,429
those types of things using IIS with
password IIS super super complex gamma

319
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:07,410
cameras

320
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,910
additional disclosures other still
working through the actual identifier

321
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,500
numbers that's why you see up here
there's some question marks I does have

322
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,620
what I have the matter at this point
where some of these that there still are

323
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:28,370
still working through x-ray systems this
one was really interesting so this was

324
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:36,709
when you get to the device and have
access to the device they have scripts

325
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,659
that you can run and just launched their
scripts and just start creating all

326
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:46,039
kinds of accounts that you want so that
first one is actually creates service

327
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:51,809
admin level tech level accounts one into
what the password service tech those

328
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:55,080
other ones are if you want to create you
know user accounts across these systems

329
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,010
in back that's how you create the first
20 accounts 23:41 these these scripts

330
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:07,539
and they'll run them all with the pastor
of this right here this is the word

331
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:13,470
cloud so this is all that information is
wrapped up in one word clout with

332
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:19,549
usernames and passwords I don't know if
anyone caught it but I really struggled

333
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:24,460
because if you notice the big guy that
was obviously the most common password

334
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,900
and their allies across most systems
that we found the most common password

335
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:37,770
used actually your password has a pound
in front of it when I was in putting on

336
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,289
separation and the word cloud none of
them would return the special characters

337
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:49,970
so I quickly realized sadly that word
cloud applications have better

338
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:56,640
sanitation and inputs and sensitization
than many of our medical device

339
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,920
applications so it was a special
characters

340
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,960
like that so medical devices
applications definitely wouldn't want to

341
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,130
block and that but so this is kind of
not a hundred percent accurate isn't a

342
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,660
special characters but it gives an
indication of things that are reused how

343
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:23,210
common they are cross-platform most
nights so if there indeed people are

344
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,040
there still issues some of the things
that you know I want to point out is

345
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,120
looking again grabbing it from their
documentation and that's what I'm

346
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,020
representing many cases their
documentation and structs don't change

347
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:43,379
credentials and password resets on the
accounts show examples of it other times

348
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,370
documentation and strokes change the
password on your account they won't be

349
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,800
able to support you

350
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:57,220
third documentation is not updated with
how to change default credentials in

351
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,810
many cases it is I do agree that you
know definitely default they clearly

352
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,190
tell you how to change those but in many
cases they don't tell you anywhere in

353
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,630
their guide how to change them and they
send you completely information on never

354
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:16,570
change and were you know we won't be
able to provide support and lastly many

355
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,370
of these systems are integrated either
by the manufacturer or a third party

356
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,040
integrators they rely heavily on this
documentation when they show up an

357
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,560
organization so these ligands oh god you
can test on medical devices all the time

358
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:36,530
and I would say over 75% of the time
that I find in documentation that's not

359
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:42,030
just be specific again that's systemic
problem across the board they work on

360
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,960
these devices because they're in the
manual and that's what the owners are

361
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,280
using let's go to some examples so
you're the top one or three samples on

362
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,399
your way to the top one you can see this
is out of the documentation user must

363
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,200
change faster at next logon unchecked
don't push it cannot change password

364
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,120
check it make sure they can't change it

365
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,979
password never expires check
discrepancies here

366
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:13,070
emergency login this is this is a
difficult one because there are very

367
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,200
good clinical reasoning

368
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,280
why we do this and why many other
controls you know may not be in place

369
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,320
and in some aspects but we've got to get
better at this is many of these Lakers

370
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,610
loggins that you just walk in and say
emergency and then it just let you into

371
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:31,500
the system changing passwords this is
one you see down here in the bottom

372
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,430
important do not change the inside
password remote access for the disabled

373
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:40,500
right inside support of passwords
changed so as a provider of you see

374
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:47,810
these types of important messages that
you follow this is the default or is it

375
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,500
what what you're using in most cases is
what you're using me as telling you and

376
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,730
warning you like don't be changing these
things so never expire

377
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:03,510
another one inside account we showed you
in practice with an exclamation point do

378
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:13,300
not change this past week over fears the
pcAnywhere

379
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:20,100
in a system with PCR using this user
name and password and for those of you

380
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,189
that work in healthcare no healthcare
positions can tell you to the second how

381
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,570
much time they spend everyday logging in

382
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:32,040
so let's give them a nice handy password
manager feature lets just say yes and it

383
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,180
will remember I loggins will never have
to log in to this system in kind of some

384
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,120
no problem you know not very good
security controls are in place in there

385
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,489
is documentation up top 40 station
operator for sign your name and password

386
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:53,660
apparently they are back during the
application they can just give you a

387
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,830
username and password to your system
anytime you want to call it go ahead to

388
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,429
reset a password is entered
argumentation auto reset the user's

389
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:09,740
password the password I don't want I
want to point out so well I didn't take

390
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:16,550
all of these and do the concept and show
how exactly you could change

391
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:20,810
configuration parameters in those types
of things because i dont wanna scale it

392
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,990
down to that detail with these level of
devices just because the patient safety

393
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,250
aspect this is to give you an idea of
how

394
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,830
attacker would think or are you could
potentially make a system do

395
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,490
unintentional things and I haven't tried
this understanding this theoretically

396
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,330
these things that I do on other systems
right and so radiology system was the

397
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:45,260
biggest concern is dosing levels right
dosing levels and with your ionizing

398
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,280
radiation with linear accelerators most
types of things its placement of that

399
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:54,970
this is you can see it to perform the
following steps you must generate x-ray

400
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,480
radiation so we know if we do those it's
going to admit radiation we know that

401
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:07,320
this system is going to do that we have
logins probably write a low level and

402
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,659
it's just doing testing but if we have
access to we look at these systems a lot

403
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:18,290
of these systems Windows based systems a
hard dick all XML XML files have all the

404
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,710
information all the parameters for all
the stuff in it when you get into next

405
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,230
our systems that's all for the most part
residing in conf files that are getting

406
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,830
called from the application to do this
if we sit in between here we look what

407
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:35,399
this traffic looks like can we all just
on those parameters and some of those

408
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,319
files to when we do that generates
higher level radiation those types of

409
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,080
things and that's how you start figuring
out these systems you know this

410
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,659
documentation and understanding
architecture of you know how they

411
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:54,550
potentially could cause there's another
interesting morning in the documentation

412
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,190
of the first one was in one piece of
documentation and says it here strictly

413
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,900
the procedures in this manual when you
going to look at the documentation and

414
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,870
says the editors and producers G
documentation claim no responsibility

415
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:15,259
for the accuracy content so they're
telling you that here strictly to it but

416
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:21,850
also try not accurate so some trying we
gotta get you know everyone hates

417
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,930
talking about liability liability who's
liable but we've gotta get there like

418
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,720
this is completely contradictory of you
telling me I have to follow your manual

419
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,700
and then telling me we have no
responsibility for accuracy of what's in

420
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,348
there

421
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:47,349
r rights as a second problem is kind of
a bad screenshot but I'm not gonna tell

422
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:53,049
you what type of device is it is a
medical device obviously I'm to point

423
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:57,999
out some issues here so I was serious
and burp log into this

424
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:07,598
the top shot is a is a poster quest know
what that is is that the bottom piece is

425
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,960
actually when you log into the system
through the web application with

426
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,710
hardcoded credentials by the way that's
how you get into the system there on

427
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,099
wireless network so I went to the
wireless parameter settings and I was at

428
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:27,489
first I was like Oh awesome this device
actually is a wpa2 not web great and it

429
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:31,599
stars out the password so you can see
what the password is and I said well let

430
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,859
me see census not a cell CCDP let me see
if I put bourbon there if it's actually

431
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:44,319
checking that I change the value of the
wpa2 when I hit save on the on the forum

432
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:49,308
or just passes every single field goal
sure enough I hit save it passes every

433
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:53,229
single field in the clear tax and the
bottom is then able that we were able to

434
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:59,399
compromise the entire internal network
with a WPA TKIP we're also the top is

435
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,890
the POST request and so if you look at
the top of the poster has no session

436
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:09,308
management no tokenization she take that
post requests with these devices sent

437
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:14,440
all the devices to hook up to your rogue
access point Bridget and then you can

438
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,349
start intercepting in seeing the type of
data fields are going between devices

439
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:23,969
and you kind of start reversing you know
how that system works so application

440
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:28,769
security is definitely definitely a
problem this is common amongst many

441
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:32,538
devices

442
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:41,450
first you know we know all software has
flaws and as we increase connectivity

443
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:47,308
we're gonna increase interactions with
these devices so essentially you know

444
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:49,680
software driven connecting medical
devices

445
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,549
when we think about it as a girl exposed
device there is that lack of patient

446
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,130
safety alignment like I said
historically and health care we've been

447
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,530
very focused and we got budgets and
programs starting 10 years ago with with

448
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:08,430
hip and we've kind of built around
information assurance and compliance

449
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:14,089
doesn't equal a solid you know security
framework of program and if you use

450
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,420
patient safety instead of patient
privacy you gonna do a lot better at

451
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:24,690
building a security team of care than
patient privacy problem where it is

452
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,070
right

453
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:33,030
increasingly accessible to talk about
privacy mister 11 many people believe

454
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:37,020
that the FDA validate cyber safety
controls and devices

455
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:44,610
absolutely do not FDA did they said
they've been very good to work with over

456
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:49,510
the last couple years reaching out
working you know to try to move security

457
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:53,510
controls forward we did have a workshop
back in October November and kinda had

458
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,500
all stakeholders in a room on Dec at the
FDA building and then they released

459
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,000
guidance for manufacturers the kind of
outline different controls that they

460
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,030
should be putting in place that they
have to respond to her say how their

461
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,370
dressing the 510 K

462
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:13,430
the key word is not validated there's
not a thing called MDS two forms where

463
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,270
they can to put some answers security
questionnaire and again that's not

464
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:23,300
validated kind of a test the 24 you put
in the documentation submitted they

465
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,810
looked at it they pass it through less
intense not a prerequisite we covered

466
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:36,660
that earlier on various issues should be
including medical devices can 44

467
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:42,870
credentials doing vulnerability scanning
yes these are sensitive devices yes many

468
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,930
organizations have overcome that and are
actively doing vulnerability scans of

469
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,620
course you're not gonna throw denial of
service and those types of things at you

470
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:57,319
know systems that are in production but
there are checks that you can be doing

471
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,110
for patching those types of things
there's checks that you can do the

472
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,150
checks for default credentials you can
taste this list

473
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,580
today go back to health care
organization you can scan our

474
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,920
environment see if there's any of these
G credentials ecology hey we got some

475
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,560
default passwords we need to fix and
have them walk you through how to fix

476
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,850
them there isn't unfortunately updated
documentation still of how to change

477
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,589
some of these so you'll have to contact
them to to get that but again they are

478
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:30,680
going to north with depression safety is
really not a spectator sport if you're

479
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,919
in health care admissions in your values
you need to get involved we are trying

480
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,330
to work you know engage willing allies
gotten a lot better

481
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:44,049
few years ago if you put a security
researcher a medical device manufacture

482
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:53,000
and the FDA in a room and stabbing each
other not going to get much accomplished

483
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,890
right but today completely different
story so people understand that issue

484
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,830
they know they're difficult things to
talk about because it does affect

485
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:05,400
patient safety but everyone's matured
past that level and red least talking

486
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,300
now implementing some good things
continue as it is right what are the big

487
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:18,340
ones is right now the FDA the way they
handle adverse events or medical device

488
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:27,040
malfunctions is there's an issue that's
reported a jew dictated like clinically

489
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,920
always clinical cause of death he
actually died from pneumonia being on

490
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,360
the ventilator didn't die from device
malfunction but its generic market once

491
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,830
again and medical device malfunction
it's a medical device malfunction so was

492
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:45,279
it a separate server thing intentional
or unintentional power on these devices

493
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,910
right all the time because there XP
system yeah that malware was supposed to

494
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,540
steal credit card information but did it
potentially cause something else to

495
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:01,670
happen we don't know how it goes in the
generic button pocket we don't have in

496
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:07,220
most healthcare organizations robust
Incident Response Program get a virus on

497
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,540
a you know a medical device or is
reporting system or application

498
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,340
interacts with a medical device first
thing is all go clear clear off the

499
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,980
virus scanner working

500
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,570
don't fall over the biomat even say hey
we reported adverse event thirty days

501
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,180
since we seen this on there that's not
happening right now so you're working on

502
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,960
ensuring that but this is why I you know
when I get the question has an event

503
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,400
happen and you always get the answer and
I have to tell you we don't have it

504
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,400
recorded event that has happened well
forensic evidence is very lacking we

505
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,720
throw it into a generic market right now
so we have what we haven't had anything

506
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,560
documented of this type of incident
happening that resulted in no loss of

507
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,290
life or something that from like a three
security event I personally think we can

508
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:59,650
have lower assurance that hasn't
happened because you know those devices

509
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:06,270
don't have that evidence captured don't
have those forensic capabilities going

510
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,070
forward like what can we do right now
there's a better way and again it's no

511
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,760
patient safety is overriding objective
here

512
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,390
aborting filled practices this is a big
one in this industry we don't always

513
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,359
have perfect solutions and know what's
going to work a hundred percent but we

514
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:29,830
absolutely know what's failed in the
past we know her credentials on

515
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:34,590
encrypted communication not being able
to update or applications does not work

516
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:39,180
so we shouldn't continue putting systems
out like that if we fail again

517
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,629
differently that's better than
continuing to feel the same way for the

518
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,430
last ten years and that's what we have
to get better at as an industry is

519
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:50,850
avoiding those you know failed practices
and really you know adopting better ones

520
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:56,250
we do that we're gonna have a lot more
reliable medical devices coming to

521
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,660
market is not going to be delayed and
that the overall cost of that is going

522
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,399
to be much lower than it is now going
back on these legacy devices what you

523
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,820
find them and have to do source code
reviews and figure out where all the

524
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,490
hopes are in those types of things
you're gonna stand that in very much

525
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:18,060
more resilient right to attacks and
adversaries so how can you get involved

526
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,049
to wrap up here before I get into
questions if you're interested in

527
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:27,990
researching medical devices you're
probably not gonna

528
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:34,189
get your significant other to approve
buying a CT or MRI system and getting a

529
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:40,400
crane to come through basement wall down
there but there's other devices you know

530
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,340
so there's been good research done on
those types of things patient monitors

531
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:50,750
are you can acquire that was another
site you can go ahead and buy am always

532
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,650
an interesting one

533
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,690
many researchers to myself

534
00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:00,440
acquired by eBay very interesting to get
those devices and that many times

535
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,320
medical devices don't follow standard
decommissioning process you know

536
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,330
database patient information still on
them

537
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:11,119
asset tracking information but hospital
came from get involved in industry

538
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,130
working like I said a lot more
collaboration taking place in the space

539
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:23,340
so people are talking to each other in
nhi SEC is helped by sac is starting to

540
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,020
get forward momentum now they're
starting to do some good things from

541
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,740
hopeful you know they're working through
some piloting of their threat

542
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:35,049
intelligence sharing a buzzword but for
stuff like this where I can say hey

543
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:39,119
before I talk guys go ahead of time

544
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,550
go ahead sure this scanner moments
before release it

545
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:48,030
industry conferences and not just
InfoSec conferences I would say this

546
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:54,030
year I probably smoking or non you know
security research conferences and I've

547
00:45:54,030 --> 00:46:00,140
spoken more at healthcare conference in
general as well as and across the boards

548
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:05,240
are there for like hymns all the way to
health care

549
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,750
procurement folks and letting them know
what they were doing in procurement to

550
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,590
push back in contracting with the
manufacturers to can't have you no

551
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:15,390
agreement with those manufacturers are
up front on you know how they're going

552
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,589
to handle vulnerabilities what types of
controls they have in place those types

553
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,930
of things so to speak at conferences you
know if you wanna get involved here and

554
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,609
the calorie count of Craig mentioned
didn't see it but researchers kinda

555
00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:31,750
focused on human life public safety
issues obviously medical is one space

556
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,830
and you're pretty involved with with
that group over there and then

557
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,890
those guys are doing some of the stuff
on the automotive side couple other

558
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:43,509
areas that you know that public safety
so check that out if you haven't you

559
00:46:43,510 --> 00:47:00,720
haven't heard of them go ahead and open
it up to questions

560
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,600
so here's I was saying a couple years
ago if you would have the question the

561
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,770
question was raised around you know
trying to get all the stakeholders in

562
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:16,340
the room and kind of get to have a guess

563
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:21,830
build enough of a relationship and trust
to be able to talk openly and try to

564
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,700
solve these problems this is how many
layers with their lawyers don't come to

565
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:35,370
those those meetings but two years ago
like I said if you tried to do what the

566
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:39,630
FDA did in holding that workshop just
last november it would have been

567
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:45,050
attended there wouldn't have been open
discussion everybody was back then was

568
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:49,740
in shutdown mode and complete you know
hiding behind the facade mode and not

569
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:55,049
having any transparency yes there's
still plenty of that happening but the

570
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:00,280
manufacturers are coming to tailor their
openly discussing it worked

571
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,270
Phillips is a good example Phillips
directly last year and then at DEFCON we

572
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:07,840
talked about it and finally this fall

573
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,960
first medical device manufacturer
released vulnerability disclosure

574
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,150
coordinated disclosure policy so anybody
security researchers who ever according

575
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:21,730
to disclosure policy first manufacturer
that did that so that was a big win

576
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:26,500
Medtronic is another one that doesn't
have the full policy in but they've at

577
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:31,730
least at this point they are working on
it but you go to their site and you go

578
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:35,240
to security issues right out their main
site they have a dedicated number and

579
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,270
way to get ahold of him if it's a
security incidents routed differently so

580
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,550
that you're not running into you know
problems with not be able to get ahold

581
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,010
of him so we are making progress

582
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:49,020
yes you know the geeez again you know
they're doing much more than that many

583
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,750
of these weird the G is the Philips the
Siemens you know the Medtronic's and

584
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:57,750
they're the big dogs and they're doing
things and that's great we also have

585
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:03,800
thousands of medium and small medical
device manufacturers that haven't gotten

586
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,390
on that bandwagon yet but we still need
to get to adopt these types of things

587
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,990
before the situation gets better

588
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:38,549
else

589
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:44,830
so the first question was was ICS aware
of the documentation when they chose not

590
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:50,990
to issue an advisory when I submitted
all of the information that all the

591
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:57,569
categories you seen plus the public link
the documentation plus the exact page

592
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:01,680
number that all of these are on my
indication of what I felt you know the

593
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,950
issue was so yes they were they were
wholly aware of where that public

594
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:15,000
documentation is GE documentation
library to go to their website and you

595
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,930
know they make ICS make their decision I
can't speak for ICSI so yes that they're

596
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:25,279
fully aware of where this information
was that was publicly available and you

597
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,070
know they would have to speak to their
response on issuing an advisory not

598
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:38,210
issuing an advisory second question was
a question geez commitment to you know

599
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:42,240
kind of lessons learned updating
documentation doing things better going

600
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,879
forward I personally requested on more
than one occasion after the

601
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,120
investigation was closed I received a
response to DHS have a meeting to talk

602
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,259
about that

603
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,790
to see because I work with a lot of
providers when I go to a provider and

604
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:00,580
and we find these things you know are
they gonna provide updated documentation

605
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:05,279
for example that now that they say is
default are clearly do that are they

606
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,320
going to get better at that what did
they learn I was not offered

607
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,800
opportunities because I'm on that and
did not get a statement on that so i

608
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:41,480
cant speak to it and others back over
here

609
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,310
yes the question is I mention that the
AAA keyword doesn't validate security

610
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,270
control do they have the power to
another agency have the power to kind of

611
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:58,980
fill that role right now the FDA legally
they don't have anything that says free

612
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,640
market they can do this post market if
something happens and there's an issue

613
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,980
there's laws in place the city they have
to go back so one of the recent ones

614
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:14,190
with hospira Billy Rios does research on
high-spirited using pumps and found

615
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,330
flaws with the wireless and being able
to forge drug libraries being able to

616
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:23,359
rewrite firmware through we credentials
is actually no credentials it was wide

617
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,240
open telnet busybox to the systems or
wireless reread the firmware changed

618
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,390
changed dosing limits and the FDA did
stand up and this is post market where

619
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,970
they do have the ability to do this and
there is a lot to do this and they went

620
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:44,618
back and spirits now having to recertify
their system that's good indication of

621
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:50,240
what they can do I think premarket the
FDA understands that and this is my

622
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:58,640
opinion is that they understand they
don't want to put additional they only

623
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,460
have like 60 or 90 days

624
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,500
timeline to turn around like by thinking
submissions free market and they also

625
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,359
don't have the technical expertise to
really do that validation so I'm not

626
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,150
sure where it's gonna land but I think
what you're seeing you read up on some

627
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:17,390
stuff you're gonna start to see the UL
kind of starting to take a place in that

628
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,970
to come up with you know security
controls are working on a good medical

629
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:25,649
device framework or whatever other
Jewish communities that here at black

630
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:30,930
hat this year at a conference in the
evening before black hat this unique

631
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,379
kind of come out with their programs I
think you're going to see kind of

632
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,950
third-party certified labs doing some of
that is that gonna solve all their

633
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,750
problems no is it gonna make sure you're
not doing really basic stuff that we've

634
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,950
known not to do for 10 years like use
hardcoded passwords and make sure

635
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:49,149
they're using encryption yes it's going
to make it a lot more difficult and

636
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:52,480
they're gonna be you know safer systems
that are going forward I don't think the

637
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,029
FBI

638
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:58,659
hey is going to do that validation may
may may change may surprise you but I

639
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:02,459
think there is going to be a third party
this gonna do that that's going to kind

640
00:54:02,459 --> 00:54:07,640
of test it and then that's going to be
included in premarket submission to the

641
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,598
FDA for them to review and then I think
FDA's gonna be heavy on releasing

642
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,640
post-market surveillance those types of
things to start a new relationship with

643
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,859
them and with mitre TVs and they're
gonna mapping out stakeholder

644
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:24,219
environments and and figure it out
working with researchers to kind of

645
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,409
figure out you know what this landscape
looks like they're taking a proactive

646
00:54:27,409 --> 00:54:30,659
approach I don't think they'll be the
one to do the validation premarket

647
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:37,569
alright I don't any more time for
negotiations but I'll be back here if

648
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:40,089
you wanna swing by and ask me anything
think you guys
