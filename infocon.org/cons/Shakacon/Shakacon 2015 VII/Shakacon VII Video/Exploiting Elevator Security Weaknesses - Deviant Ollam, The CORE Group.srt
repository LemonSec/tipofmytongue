1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,050
thank you

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:19,330
so yeah this is this is the elevator
hacking talk and hopefully even if some

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,299
things are a little over your head and
different topic areas because we got

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,230
some really heavy hitters here at
shotacon everyone rides elevators more

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,720
or less except mouse she's super fitness
takes the stairs makes me look bad but

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,260
elevators this thing that everyone kind
of rock like every building in a big

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,610
city you'll find them to use them a lot
of people misuse them for trying to do

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,430
security things with them you try to do
defender II things and attackers be

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,719
doing attacker things really elevators
are not part of your security model

10
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,870
something to dispel a bunch of myths and
then hopefully give you some tips to to

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,800
do better so who talks about this stuff
will it's usually me and a buddy of mine

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,428
named Howard if you don't know me I run
a pen testing firm that does everything

13
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:05,260
from training to on-site red teaming
Howard was a guy we picked up from the

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,210
elevator industry so you know he is a
consultant and inspector he is the guy

15
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,270
who climbs around inside of elevator
shafts and he met me when he saw me

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,280
giving a talk that I briefly touched on
elevator stuff and hope one year he's

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,210
like oh my god known in the industry
talks about the stuff so I'd love to

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,199
work with you and I'm thrilled to work
with him and this is the result you

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,450
should understand along with many things
when you start doing kinetic stuff with

20
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,940
big machines it can be dangerous

21
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,590
elevators themselves are not that
dangerous most elevators are monstrously

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,420
safe there are tons and tons of people
who ride elevators every year very often

23
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,930
there's never an incident the few
incidents that there are even the

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,780
fatalities tend to be people working on
elevator doors so as long as you're not

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,380
a dumbing don't do things that will
unite not there are certain failure

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,530
modes that can occur as you can see
right here this is a leg in between the

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:02,460
door sill and the landing cell now this
leg was saved but you don't want to be

28
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,440
that person you also don't want to be
the person who's like well I'm I'm not

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,239
some dumb ass like that I'm smart I can
play with this stuff

30
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,360
damage is still a bad time because if
you damage things on elevators and

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,870
escalators you can wind up causing way
more dollar signs in damage than you

32
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,140
thought and facing let's say a felony
criminal mischief charge

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,160
so this year we have sound on the laptop
here this is the famous escalator

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,000
helicopter like haha you know you're
doing this like your local mall or

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,450
something this is a guy who tried to do
the elevator escalator helicopter and he

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,119
did not do it well yeah that was like
fifteen thousand and damaged felony

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,720
criminal mischief charge like you're
gonna have a bad time if you don't know

38
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,910
what you're doing with this stuff

39
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,520
leave it to the experts please and
that's what I usually do i mean Howard

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,230
my expert guy he's the one I send it to
the elevators first half the time when I

41
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,720
don't know what I'm doing if you're not
familiar with elevator systems I'm going

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,550
to give you a really quick primer there
are two variants of motive power for

43
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,880
elevators when you are in the cab the
actual cab that travels up and down that

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,049
you that enclosure doesn't have its own
machine driving things it's not like the

45
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,790
cap is on a you know heist that in
itself is powering you're either being

46
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,600
driven up from below or being pulled
from above sea of overhead traction but

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,840
you know cable wrote systems or you have
hydraulics you have pistons pushing up

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,829
from underneath now whether you're
talking about a piston driven system or

49
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,769
a rope system the powers actually being
driven a driven from a motor room you're

50
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:43,650
not seeing that you're interacting with
the motor room you're interacting with

51
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,510
the system via the fixtures will get to
them will talk about them in a bit but

52
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,790
that's you know the car itself has no
power other than the electricity

53
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,239
powering the lights the power to host
the thrust all of that is coming from a

54
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,299
room somewhere else that has a
controller in it this is a typical

55
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,620
elevator controller cabinet not a lot of
you know advanced circuitry going on in

56
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,860
there we'll talk about that in greater
detail in my my off

57
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:16,880
ok I don't question the other Bluetooth
are getting their their their the

58
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,260
industry is really in this weird space
if it isn't broke fix it so you'll see a

59
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,150
lot of bad ideas coming out of the
elevator industry trying to modernize

60
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,370
and it needs to modernize in a lot of
ways believe me but normally when you're

61
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,840
interacting with an elevator you are
interacting either with an overhead drum

62
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,099
system or a pump in the basement and you
are talking remotely you were talking to

63
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,800
this controller and the controller is
doing all the logic controller is

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,290
servicing demand based on what is called
automatic mode so it's collecting all

65
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,380
the hall calls it's dispatching based
upon passenger use of the car operating

66
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,360
panel normally you don't have to think
very much about what's happening you

67
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,100
tell the elevator I want to go somewhere
and it goes there

68
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,790
r now again that's automatic mode there
are a whole lot of special modes of

69
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,720
operation that we can talk about now for
example there's attendant service

70
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,420
attendant service which you don't see in
many cities anymore is when there's an

71
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,180
actual person in the elevator maybe in a
super posh building attendant mode

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,280
involves a few extra controls that are
enabled sometimes behind a hidden panel

73
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,280
sometimes the right on the panel with a
few key into attendant mode you can do

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,729
things like reverse direction if you're
on an elevator you on the fifth floor

75
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,780
have you ever been trying to go to the
lobby and I'll shoot this is going up

76
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,729
you know I gotta wait for to go up to
seven and then back down

77
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,830
intended mode you can flip direction you
can also bypass certain floors you can

78
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,640
ignore all demand now this isn't major
for security implications but it's just

79
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,729
you know understand there are hidden
features that will change the priority

80
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,710
and changed dispatched logic internal
affair

81
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,169
r if you're in a building that doesn't
hire a person to be in attendance but

82
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,780
you want to give people special
privileges there are executive modes are

83
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,340
VIP modes this is just someone who is
super important it has a key

84
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,169
it's really funny depending on how this
is configured some controllers and some

85
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:11,660
actual elevator cabs they will or they
will voice the be like this elevator is

86
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,080
needed for priority service please exit
at the next landing and it'll be good

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,150
you know it'll kick everyone out of the
elevator then serve the floor with the

88
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,060
VIP and then ignore all the hall
demanding and so there are a lot of

89
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,670
different things you can do to make
moving around the building more

90
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,310
efficient for example why is this not
more common if you just gonna building

91
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,660
Jewish dinner something called load
bypass how many people have put too much

92
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,850
stuff or people in an elevator at like
got angry beeped right but how many

93
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,710
times have you been in an elevator where
your travel I get down from 425 and its

94
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,989
full right like it's literally full of
you and everyone else in it but it keeps

95
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,960
platforming

96
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,909
you're trying to check out everyone's
trying to check out and you just gotta

97
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,990
watch the door cyclic sorry we're full
elevators know how heavy they are you

98
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,790
can configure in the controller if this
elevator is it seventy to eighty percent

99
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,840
of its weight load stop trying to
collect calls just go to the freakin

100
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,859
lobbying get people out of that cab why
this isn't turned on more often is

101
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,490
beyond me and he knew since modes you
can again this is just basic management

102
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,010
stuff in your building if people are
being a jerk and pressing all the

103
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,900
buttons you can jump out those calls it
also you can base it around how often

104
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,900
the scanner edge detect people getting
on or off so here is a bunch of us just

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,859
hammering the panel but you can only get
a few floor calls in before it's like

106
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,820
come on what do you guys your budget
hackers you're not really go in these

107
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,670
places and it just jumps out you can do
this in a building to make your

108
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,030
elevators more efficient your stock
elevator config prolly doesn't have this

109
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:50,789
enabled yeah peak operation against same
thing why if everyone in your building

110
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,400
is trying to come up from the ground
floor in the morning why are your

111
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,109
elevators idling and parking at like
high floors after they service demand

112
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,630
you can have them parked down at the
bottom and likewise at the end of the

113
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,100
day

114
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,630
you can have your elevators park at the
top floors is everyone's trying to get

115
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,190
the hell down

116
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,290
configuring all this is totally possible
for simple basic efficiency you can also

117
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,270
configure a lot of interesting modes for
safety

118
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,090
there's something called seismic mode
that is literally if the building starts

119
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,060
shaking there are sensors depending on
what sonya live in that will immediately

120
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,240
stopped the elevator at a nearby floor
announced hey get out there is a problem

121
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,570
and tell people to leave the elevator in
the case of emergency

122
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,309
maybe you've seen like a little you know
seismic sensor little a little lamp the

123
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,150
cold jewels on the car operating panel
that is a mode enabled in a lot of

124
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,679
places like California came from the
mainland you probably have seismic mode

125
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,069
in your elevators whether you realize it
or not

126
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,310
now we're getting into some security
stuff instead of you know seismic unrest

127
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,979
as Howard likes to make the joke about
civil unrest riot mode is something that

128
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,460
really expensive places sometimes
museums will have enabled riot motives

129
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,350
if there is a massive disturbance
outside a building you can kill ground

130
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,310
floor access and all the ground floor
access the rest of the building can

131
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,400
still service normal demand but the
elevator literally won't go to the lobby

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,610
and we'll collect calls from the lobby
but the rest of the building is just

133
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,280
fine

134
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,560
have you ever been in a medical facility
maybe you've seen code blue switches

135
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,510
medical priority service it's like that
executive service but on steroids

136
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,540
the idea is an elevator will immediately
the nearest elevator in the bank will

137
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,339
stop and reverse direction even if its
mid floor and kick everyone out say oh

138
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,460
my god someone you know we need to get
this medical gurney in a elevator go go

139
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,480
go and you're noticing a theme with some
of these pictures a lot of these special

140
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,930
modes are triggered by key switches were
gonna keep coming back to that because

141
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,589
it's going to become very interesting
how they work

142
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,770
another thing in buildings another thing
also tighten security medical buildings

143
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,160
you'll have CODEPINK which is baby theft
mode if the little baby like LoJack in

144
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,329
the hospital you know how modern
hospitals if you move a baby you're not

145
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,310
authorized to a lot of shit happens in
hospital doors lock da announcements

146
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:05,920
happen

147
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,010
elevators can lock down they can refuse
to to go somewhere or they can be

148
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,800
flipped into something called security
recall where either through an automated

149
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,260
condition or through someone triggering
it from a security office an elevator

150
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,770
can work like a man trap and elevator
can deliver some 120 destination of your

151
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,720
determination like let's say the
security floored with the guards right

152
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,210
there and then allowed to hold them in
the cabin not open its doors or it will

153
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,769
force cycle the doors so they can't you
know hide in the cap

154
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:40,579
all these are possible in most elevator
controllers but depending on the nature

155
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,589
of the building the elevators in you may
not ever see them they should exist

156
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,329
though and if you need to speak to
someone about this

157
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:51,149
understand their peeps not your parts
oil and grease tech who knows this but

158
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,399
there are people in the industry who
could do all this and more

159
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,579
the big one for us as independent as a
you know sorry spend testers is

160
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:03,069
independent service independent service
mode

161
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,240
far away the most useful thing you can
use if you're trying to do and do

162
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,180
something in a building with elevator
you shouldn't what is independent

163
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,439
service it's like having local admin on
the elevator it takes the elevator out

164
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,040
of group operation so we'll ignore all
the hall demand and it gives you

165
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,969
depending on how it's configured usually
complete override authority on the

166
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,110
entire panel sometimes it's a key switch
sometimes it's just a toggle switch but

167
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,400
imagine being able to go this floor like
I can't go to this floor its locked-out

168
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,970
independent service usually will drive
to that florida is fine and when you get

169
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,970
to that floor it's not going to open the
doors because again it until you tell it

170
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,950
to open the doors it'll just sit there

171
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,100
I've used independent service to hide in
buildings on Penn tests like all social

172
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,380
engineer my way in key switch and even a
bank of like eight elevators no one is

173
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,380
you know a frank so funny I've been
going outside to smoke every two hours

174
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,160
have you noticed elevator 6 hasn't been
responding to any haldeman today no one

175
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,709
notices that they just get on the first
elevator that shows up and like I'm

176
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,940
hiding in an elevator for four hours

177
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,770
plugged in to let you know if they have
a little GFCI in some of them just plug

178
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,930
my phone in one time I rolled in office
chair into an elevator as I got broken

179
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,260
its wobbly I'll see you later

180
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,520
servicing this and I just stayed in the
elevator till 6:45 then drove it down to

181
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,050
the lobby let everyone else in from the
team and we went up to the top level the

182
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,959
biggest override however is not every
elevator has independent service every

183
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,370
elevator by code has fire service

184
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,170
fire service is not something I'm
encouraging you to just play with

185
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,810
because you think you know how it works

186
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:47,520
you don't things can go pretty wrong but
fire service by code overrides almost

187
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,279
every other element of the elevators
operation and if you have floors that

188
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,270
are locked out if you have a badge
reader in your elevator that you need to

189
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,260
lodge a call to another floor all of
that gets thrown out the window if the

190
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,470
elevator is running on fire operation so
you could have you know Bigg Boss

191
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,350
so-and-so's like no one should come up
to the sea level on this building I you

192
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,430
know after your badge New York code any
punch the Bubba this guy doesn't care

193
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,729
r fire code states that in an emergency
condition

194
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,720
firefighters do not have to mess around
with credentials and badges and

195
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,810
everything else they don't have to mess
around with which floors orkut on

196
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:26,018
cut-out firefighters contrive an
elevator anywhere they need to go

197
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:31,259
now not every elevator is running on the
same fire service config this is where I

198
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,410
get into like don't mess with it if you
don't know what you're doing here you

199
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,429
have two different elevators in the same
building one of them seems to have a key

200
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:42,040
switch on the panel the other one
doesn't if you turn slightly you'll see

201
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,579
this was a modernized retrofit and they
had to throw on a case which in the cab

202
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,019
on a different side panel on the side of
the winds gotten here there are

203
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,189
different fire codes there are different
years that fire codes of an adopted and

204
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:58,009
every different jurisdiction in forces
and adopts and chooses to roll out

205
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:03,029
different codes different times they all
should operate roughly the same way but

206
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:07,540
weirdness can ensue if you don't know
what you're doing

207
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,868
one other type of mode and we won't talk
too much about it

208
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:14,309
who could possibly be more important
than a firefighter if we're talking

209
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:18,618
about you know firefighter operation
overrides most elevator security who's

210
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:24,110
more important than the fire crew
elevator people of course elevator guys

211
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,559
want to be able to do anything they want
to do and we'll talk about the hoist way

212
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,089
a little bit we'll talk about what's
called a choice to inspection motorway

213
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:36,649
access mode do not bring around in the
host way like it is not a safe place to

214
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:41,519
be there are plenty of people who do
urban exploring and they say oh man so

215
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,509
cool like you know like MIT campus this
is you know I think it 50 East you can

216
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,259
even see some had to write do not open
this door it will shut down elevator

217
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,829
because you should not be in the house
where you should not be in the shaft

218
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:56,258
there are a lot of safety sensors in
there and if you trip them the elevator

219
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,779
should just turn off doesn't always
happen there's also a lot of fancy run

220
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,449
controls in the hoist way on the car top
you should not be using them they exist

221
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,449
and I'm gonna talk about them for
security reasons but just realize this

222
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,449
isn't weird industry this is an industry
where if you're not in the industry you

223
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:18,089
might think something makes sense and it
doesn't here is a shutdown key switch

224
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:20,200
for the motor generator for the system

225
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:27,510
how do you think you shut down or turn
on the elevator you turn shut down to on

226
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,860
to shut down the elevator system so that
you get a lot of this stuff in the

227
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,530
industry

228
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,790
be aware of that don't just start
messing around with things you bought a

229
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,189
key on eBay

230
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,970
let's talk a little bit about trying to
use an elevator for security and stuff

231
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,750
that you do tend to see and then we're
going to show you how it all doesn't

232
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:51,770
work so disabling the hall call buttons
not being able to just you know get an

233
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,800
elevator show up when you want to either
using key switches or lockouts at the

234
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,640
hall stations here you have you noticed
an elevator you need to keep it for up

235
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,590
operation donna is weird hockey stuff
right like you he logical sure this was

236
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,210
some weird bolt-on mod that's probably
not even you know compliant because

237
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,960
house a firefighter going to be able to
call this elevator this was in a school

238
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,870
and I wonder if I might have a video in
a little bit you're going to see the

239
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,790
same school you see what a kid figured
out to be able to call this elevator

240
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,240
here is another elevator that even
though has a bit what looks like a

241
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,890
button it's not actually a button you
can press it the only way to latch this

242
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:33,740
call again is to use your room key and
then I just placed all call again weird

243
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,240
things that somebody probably modded on
themselves but you'll see people try to

244
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,240
do that to try to just disable your
interaction with the buttons you'll see

245
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,860
that on the carpeting panel you see
floor cut-outs here's a bunch of floor

246
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,470
call buttons and here's a bunch of keys
which is next to them they can turn on

247
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,670
or turn off floor access have you ever
seen that many of you might not realize

248
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,660
this is not like a serial circuit where
you are breaking the connection with

249
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,079
that case which because what would
happen again if a firefighter gets in

250
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,829
that elevator needs to go before they
don't have to worry about is this which

251
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,540
turned on or off these are logic gates
these are logic conditions so these key

252
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,950
switches turning on or off

253
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,190
are telling the controller you're
supposed to ignore this in the

254
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,459
controller still sees that input and you
can override these key switches either

255
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,340
independent mode or fire service mode or
other special modes

256
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:30,439
again you've seen these in hotels right
card readers use my key card so I can

257
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,770
get up to this floor down on that floor
plenty of buildings either they will

258
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,410
only check that it's a valid card for
that building or they will check that

259
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,610
it's valid within a certain date range

260
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,350
there's plenty of hotels where even if
your key card is expired for your room

261
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,830
it'll still work in the elevator i've
seen that happen it's bizarre but it

262
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,139
only works

263
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,700
this is probably the only way I've ever
seen

264
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,620
proper security of an elevator and you
can see there's like the whole call but

265
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,610
there's this big lock right next to it

266
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,560
well that's not locking out the whole
call button this is a giant cage in

267
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,300
front of the elevator doors and this is
a Corrections Facility now it's funny

268
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,000
that we like to slow the hell is going
on there I really want you to think

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,970
though of your elevators as though they
are just a giant open stairway running

270
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,400
through your building treat your
elevators as though there is no security

271
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,440
based on what person can go up or down
one floor two floors or any floors and

272
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,360
you'll see what let's go ahead and look
at some of those lockout systems again

273
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,209
and see how they fail well there was
that one you know can't call the

274
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,930
elevator 'cause there's no real buttons
right well here's the switch some kid

275
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,520
went oh my god what did you just do
let's let's play that again maybe with

276
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,080
some alright

277
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,530
so here we go

278
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:54,930
alright what it was that I get to class
on time with this person did is they

279
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,740
just broke the scanner edge the elevator
happened to be parked at that floor and

280
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,200
they tricked the doors into thinking all
the doors have to bounce open I'm not

281
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,250
saying this to work all the time I'm
also not saying stick weird ship through

282
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,110
in elevators hallway like toy stores
when you don't know what's on the other

283
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,540
side but I'm just saying weird things
will happen in elevator systems and just

284
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,330
cause you think it's secure it may not
be

285
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,470
by the way that you know accessing high
floors in like a nice posh building or

286
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,490
something simple this is like super low
budget hacking right the easiest way

287
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,279
ever to get to the top floor if
someone's having a party up there just

288
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,799
keep lacing up calls and social engineer
tailgate your way up in a building if

289
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,200
you're placing and registering up demand
and every time you get in an elevator

290
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,429
just try to go as high as you can or
tailgate behind someone the elevators

291
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:49,620
got to be going higher than you if it
opens for you so if you get if you're on

292
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,158
seven public place and up call just wait

293
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,600
someone's going up beyond seven you ride
with them maybe they get you to 11 place

294
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,649
another up call it's never going to like
come up from the lobby and sit there and

295
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:05,049
wait for you if you're not you know
there's usually someone in it so over

296
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:09,350
and over this is just us at some you
know Condotel trying to get up to the

297
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,110
top floor and none of us had Hilton gold
status at the time so it's ok let's play

298
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,178
sup demand now this is a car this is the
other thing if an empty car does show up

299
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,960
just send it down to the lobby so we
sent that one down and don't do that

300
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,809
adores ever by the way so it plays
another up call place and we eventually

301
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,970
just piggybacked our way up a few times
I think the last stage of its actually

302
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,440
like a hotel employee just takes us up
to the top floor as he was going up

303
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,860
there with a luggage cart there we go

304
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,580
so again like I'm not drop in crazy
odiaun you at this one but just because

305
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,970
you think other parties on the top floor
of the hotel can get up there you

306
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,660
totally can just keep trying it's it's
like you know leapfrogging your

307
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,920
tailgating in and I think we were
showing this to the management of the

308
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,450
company now you realize that we didn't
we didn't realize that was so easy to

309
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,950
get to the top floor and he said well I
mean it's a little easier than that like

310
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,960
you have the the top floor with a nice
bar and everything in it but at the very

311
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,850
end of this hallway because it wouldn't
be a physical security talk of line if I

312
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,649
didn't remind people to not do dumb
things with their other doors this door

313
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:25,480
on each end of their building was
horribly security as well

314
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:40,850
attack keep all that stuff in mind and I
wouldn't be a deep dark if I didn't talk

315
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,520
about crazy things but all of these
modes all of these different trickery in

316
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,250
different hidden motives by the way
there are usually panels in the cab

317
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,770
somewhere that you can pop open maybe
they're locked maybe they're just behind

318
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,030
the wainscot you might not realize that
but look for hidden panels in your

319
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,639
elevators if you're interested in
accessing a lot of this

320
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:05,649
many times these are going to not just
give you toggle switches they're going

321
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:09,668
to present you with key switches and you
think Oh my god there's so many like

322
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,609
those keys here keys there which keys
could you ever use and you'll often see

323
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:17,668
this in the industry this is called
elevator graffiti where various tax

324
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,889
don't like which key do I use for which
things he does he run stop is khone won

325
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:27,158
independence KY nay for choice to
enlighten fans can 82 so like people are

326
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,849
writing notes to themselves because they
think there's just so many keys and

327
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,970
every building I never would remember
which ones to use

328
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:40,030
Howard is a very interesting mind my
buddy how it works on the stuff with me

329
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,670
and in the industry he does start
noticing keys and he does start thinking

330
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,320
about keys and he starts taking notes
about keys and then Howard started

331
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,080
collecting keys now that looks like a
lot of keys but that works that

332
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,590
manufactured the faulty switch in
virtually every elevator you will ever

333
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,270
find because there's a lot of different
brands of elevator and there's third

334
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,430
market you know like third-party fixture
manufacturers the you can do

335
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,980
modernization and retrofitting but
that's not the finite list these are

336
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,830
basically every this is really obscure
stuff at the end like praise the Lord

337
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,070
and mad elevator and stuff you never
gonna see those the big the Big Four in

338
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,070
elevators plus maybe at going innovation
that is almost every elevator you will

339
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,810
ever see

340
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,139
and they all can be identified like I do
this to Howard all the time on jobs I

341
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,170
sent him pictures and I do have totally
gonna get in this thing which which keys

342
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,650
do I use he's like you know that it's a
square button it's a little bit rounded

343
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,230
it's a schindler you know that Steve use
this key use the L 2004 key this is

344
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,060
Thyssen Krupp these are brands that you
know how often do you pay attention to

345
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,409
this stuff when you get into your
elevator you can spot instantly if you

346
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,980
know what to look for you can spot what
brand the panel is and you can know it's

347
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,980
like one of two keys half the time it's
one of one key because it's all a

348
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,460
default king

349
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,770
and if you have the keys which you know
we do you can usually you can usually

350
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,850
just flip things open and run whatever
you want in an elevator you might have

351
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,100
said this we get these questions
sometimes do they say I've been really

352
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,490
cutting edge systems i've seen these you
know there are no buttons like it's just

353
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,760
it's a so-called destination dispatch
I've seen is and why they're getting

354
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,610
popular in modern hotels yeah what's a
firefighter gonna do stand there with a

355
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,800
plastic key card no a firefighter's
going to drive to the floor they need to

356
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,590
go to there's always a hidden panel
there's always a regular car operating

357
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,020
panel demand somewhere in that elevator
r you can find well let's forget about

358
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,110
the new systems right please understand
that this is an industry stuck in the

359
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,760
past

360
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,690
really hard these are not like
screenshots of old applications from

361
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,530
history these are modern versions that
are shipping now of elevator management

362
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,510
software

363
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,920
these are what you can identify the show
which Windows version this is running

364
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,300
under the bottom line is literally like
probably running under Windows 95 but

365
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,190
yeah XP virtual you find a computer
running in an elevator machine room it

366
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,760
is running XP

367
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,800
this is the you know the control system
like kisses from us for manuals right

368
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,590
here as your default credential rightly
is this is this is important you want

369
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,970
your lift it to be 123456 that's the
basic user password they have an admin

370
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,800
account the admin account by default is
always ABC de F this is Rick this is not

371
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,899
a joke and you think like people are
changing these default passwords they

372
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:38,670
are usually not this is literally the
owner's manual for MCE that has been

373
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,190
make a certain type of elevator
controller it it's it's seriously says

374
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,680
in your leader router create a new
account for remote access call him see

375
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,830
support reset that password MZ support
by the way

376
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,850
find your router's admin account go
ahead and change that MCE support just

377
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,040
just make it all MCE support so that we
can always get in and remotely service

378
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,770
things for you this is great we'll talk
about this a lot of you want to ask me

379
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:09,700
questions about municipal code because I
said by code right your fire service has

380
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,900
to be enabled and bypassing security by
code they started pushing for a single

381
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,700
fire key back in 07 it was going to be
the it's not going to be it is it's

382
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,250
called the FeO que won because they were
so we can have this brand of fire key

383
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:31,090
and Kissin crap in the ODIs fire key we
need one fire key so this big push for

384
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,570
the FE ok one which is a very secure
lock its

385
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,490
tubular lock is no one has ever seen as
picking two blocks right over there in

386
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,560
the lockpick village to relax about 25
years old at this point now if you think

387
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,320
that's good enough what else did they do
they put the direct billing code of

388
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,870
thefe ok one in the fire code like
that's a document you can download right

389
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:01,620
now and read the PDF it's there on the
internet so what do we do is spend

390
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,010
testers will you heard some of these
stories right usually it's us using the

391
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,250
key is to do weird things if you don't
believe it here are some fine examples

392
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,440
there was a secured building one time
that they had you know what you come in

393
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,750
through the front desk and everyone is
supposed to go by the front desk and get

394
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:23,130
a badge in and sign in etcetera etcetera
they did have a backdoor the back door

395
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,640
you weren't supposed to be able to get
in

396
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,490
easily was like their parking deck right
and then there was an elevator but you

397
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,190
weren't supposed to be able to drive
that elevator cuz you need your badge

398
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,840
and no one ever expected that someone
could go up the back of the building and

399
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,800
like get in but because of corporate
culture in this building if you were

400
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,260
walking around upstairs you have
anything that looked like a badge people

401
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,170
so they must have come in through the
front desk that's the only way no one

402
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,860
questioned you this is what we showed
the client we gonna have some volume

403
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,610
again they're so this is the back door
the parking deck is locked

404
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,679
like not well but it was locked and we
actually you know where the poll footage

405
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,310
for them because they said this is
impossible you could have come up that

406
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:06,040
elevator now again don't do this if you
don't know what you're doing we had to

407
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:13,330
coordinate our key switching and you
shouldn't do things that quickly you

408
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,260
shouldn't do it out of order is the
elevator got angry at us for doing this

409
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,750
but you can see the fire joel is let
this elevator with no alarm is on fire

410
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,960
service right now this elevators
overriding any security and we can drive

411
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,460
it where everyone upstairs

412
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,850
and sure enough you know you have to
manually open the door you have to treat

413
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,199
you to do everything manually if the
whole door opened

414
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,110
operated those reasons for that you can
ask me later but when we showed this to

415
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,899
the client they were flabbergasted their
actual reaction was I wouldn't have

416
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,350
believed that if I can see it myself

417
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:48,809
we were explicitly told this elevator
doesn't go up

418
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:55,639
ok say that again and listen to yourself
saying that again

419
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,340
yeah man fire keys fire keys and other
special keys and there was a big

420
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,129
kerfuffle about this a few years back
there was an article in fact the New

421
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,170
York Post where they put this this
lovely picture and they said the post

422
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,800
has been informed its ok to show you
these keys because no one could ever

423
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,000
copy these keys if they only saw a
picture of them in the new york post but

424
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,430
this poor like retired locksmith was
selling keys to collectors on eBay and

425
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,190
they drag this guy over the coals this
is all my god can you believe you're

426
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,770
selling the the new york et which by the
way is a way better picture of the new

427
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,510
york and it like this is funny I mean
this is the key to every single elevator

428
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,550
cab in the city of New York every
elevator in the five boroughs the 2642

429
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,810
keep its a Yale which is an unrestricted
blank and it's not a huge breach of

430
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,550
security that I'm telling you what this
key is because the building code

431
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:46,580
literally is 26 14 0 like it's in the
name how did you not know that was the

432
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,800
key people

433
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,260
crazier that the net is like let's talk
about this key the 3502 key it is the

434
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,710
entire keefer main my home state of New
Jersey New Hampshire and Massachusetts

435
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,740
again

436
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,590
unrestricted blank not hard to decode
this not hard to cut this these are keys

437
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:09,000
that you're going to see more and more
I'll just walk you through some states

438
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,930
states have adopted a single key in some
of their jurisdictions the Tennessee key

439
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,390
Tennessee uses an old style lever lock
box and the funny story thing the thing

440
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,040
is this is called the Christmas tree he
is you can tell by the shape of a right

441
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,470
this is actually a repurposed old key
game well is a company that used to make

442
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,020
these pull stations that would be around
city streets they were there were like a

443
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,680
windup drum that would actually bang out
a signal if you if you broke the you

444
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,080
know the prank call if you would crank
this pack opening crank it to reset it

445
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,750
with the game well key now if you call
up like Vader Adams and you're like I

446
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,760
would like to order the Tennessee key

447
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,320
you're not authorised get the F outta
here but if you're like oh I need the

448
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,260
game welke the lecture how many do you
want we'll send those to you it's the

449
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:00,620
same key and it's the friggin Tennessee
box let's get something like another

450
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:06,489
tubular ok Indiana the state of Indiana
has a standard key box because instead

451
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,930
why why make all the elevators get
retrofit when you can just bowled a

452
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,600
little key box on the door next to the
elevator Indiana's a tubular key you

453
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,370
can't buy that key you can buy the box
what does that mean that means you can

454
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,739
pick the box then measure the cuts on
your pic then use a little hurdy gurdy

455
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:30,030
NHPC hand grinder and cut yourself a
perfectly working Indiana key that works

456
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,070
just fine

457
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,919
every elevator and not just not just
every elevator in indiana you're gonna

458
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,940
see people put a lot of stuff in that
key box but they shouldn't be putting in

459
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,340
the key box

460
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:47,199
there's the Indiana key Minnesota same
idea minnesota has a key box yes we were

461
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,120
able to manipulate it yes we're able to
pick it that's the Minnesota key let's

462
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,500
talk about Kentucky Medical key harder
to work with right like medicos isreal

463
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,539
advanced lock if you were here in the
service or if you do any government work

464
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:04,440
UC medical systems restricted keys are
not supposed to be able to get the

465
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,840
blanks if you know what an easy entry
machine as you can cut the blanks but

466
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,189
you're not picking this easily I mean
maybe john king or up here and he was

467
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,350
doing a medico to attack you could try
to pick it open but that doesn't you

468
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,840
know picking a medico doesn't really get
you anything because I just to let the

469
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,220
box is open but you still can't see
inside the thing is though to mount this

470
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,460
they ship it to you unlocked because you
need to have the holes in the back right

471
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,659
well if anybody knows anything about cam
locks you can take this lock apart and

472
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,620
if you're really careful you can just
dump those pins out then measure them

473
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,750
then look at the cuts bang their genetic
ok with your main building and the

474
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,760
sidebar building owned by the way
florida uses a medic ok in different

475
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,390
zones oh and of course we also decoded
the medical M three key this is known

476
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,789
for a think that's Orlando this number
sorry this is Orlando this is own six

477
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:58,908
this is Miami this is on seven all of
these keys that people are relying on

478
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:02,720
and saying no one could ever get this
kid since all my god it's the it's by

479
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,440
cold we have to adopt this very security
they treat it like a single point of

480
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,510
failure and guess what like failures
here oh and by the way we also did

481
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,720
Louisiana on by the way we also did
Virginia oh and by the way these states

482
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,010
all have adopted certainties by code you
can order from suppliers or you can

483
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:24,720
figure them out and cut your own this is
not the right way to treat the security

484
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,510
of your building I'm not saying this is
a bad solution for fire and first

485
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,890
responders you don't want them to be
like trying to call somebody at the

486
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,169
front desk to get an elevator key and
run around like if the building's on

487
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:38,850
fire shits gotta get out like you got to
get people safe

488
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,649
but don't think that your elevators are
somehow magically me like no one can

489
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,910
ever get our fire key I was told it's
very restricted know it freaking isn't

490
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:54,890
owned by the way what is how I do mostly
on FB ok one most elevators I've seen in

491
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,020
this area a few ok one let's talk a
little more about a few ok one in a bit

492
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:04,790
because boy that the ways you see used
very bad so these key sets I mean this

493
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,150
is what I'll just pull some mountain
pass around later I brought my key set

494
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,630
with me this is what we take on jobs
with us and yes they're expensive and

495
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,790
yes they're hard to source but that's
not impossible right if someone has

496
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,520
literally the keys to your building or
to your elevator nothing in that

497
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,199
elevator is stopping them very much from
running around your space now where

498
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,239
might they find these keys if they're
not like us to not ordering from the

499
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:34,129
industry i've seen key boxes around
places I should never see key box I have

500
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,370
seen elevator motor rooms in other rooms
where like what's this little thing on

501
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:42,120
the wall oh it's a keybox these key
boxes not only are they usually easy to

502
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,440
open because they're all this little one
right here you can order this one custom

503
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,460
ki dor you can order it default keyed
lock box system like you just ordered

504
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,900
out of a catalog with the default key
not hard to do

505
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,850
inside these key boxes with like let's
talk about the FE ok one because I love

506
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,720
this example people there's a lot of
hooks in there you never know how many

507
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,450
of which keys do you need technically
should just be one thing it should be

508
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,319
the firefighters elevator key maybe the
motor room key if they need to get in

509
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,560
the motor room and help somebody has
entrapped right this is a situation

510
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,960
where man like let's just watch ok
here's an elevator and some people on a

511
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,140
job gonna say okay there's a key box up
here try the FAA ok one key not sure

512
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,890
what it is maybe it's gonna yell looking
at only work with the FAA ok one

513
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,740
ok let's take some things out of there
there's a lot of things in this box

514
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,970
what's going on in there ok later on
simple and easy breezy right let's get

515
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,399
into the machine room and it's not just
the elevator machine room this was one

516
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,680
of you can see it that was a network of
race stack that was their security

517
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,839
system all their cameras behind that was
the machine room of course and in the

518
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,090
machine room there was another box on
the wall

519
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,660
which was very easy to pick because
again two blocks just because something

520
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,379
industry loves tubular locks they think
they're the most secure modern thing

521
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,670
ever they're not

522
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,300
so we pop that open what's in there it's
the drop key we want to get into the

523
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,200
host Raiders will show you some exploits
with that later but all of this all I

524
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,839
hear is your fire service key that we
pulled out of that box here is the alarm

525
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,410
panel key liked you want to just popular
empaneled disabled some shit how about

526
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,569
your sprinkler lockouts the sprinkler
valves like why is this key in there I

527
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,890
understand it's related to fire but all
of this stuff all of getting into all of

528
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,160
this based on one key that you can buy
literally on eBay

529
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,450
the FBI ok one you'll hear a lot of
people in the elevator world's think

530
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,250
that it was the greatest thing that ever
happened because its simplified the

531
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,200
problem and a lot of people and security
world are begging anyone to listen

532
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,000
especially if you're on the FB ok one
standard and that's the most popular

533
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,350
fire kids it's what people are buying on
eBay and right now like this I don't

534
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,500
whatever I'm just gonna say this girl
Lauren she works for one of the biggest

535
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,450
manufacturers of key switches in the
industry she works for Northeast where

536
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,460
she works with his lock I'm sorry and
they're just they have another company

537
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,460
that we're not going to call them out
and say their names I don't want them to

538
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,440
get more business they are hawking these
keys to anyone who will buy them on eBay

539
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,060
and other sites sites and the FAA ok one
far and away the best seller

540
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,670
and what was it on ebay was like 13
bucks said I'm sorry $78 for the first

541
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,900
one on top seller

542
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,400
now if you think that's fine maybe
you're just like your place like in

543
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,190
Europe where literally the fire key is
behind glass and every elevator but I

544
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:38,850
don't think that's fine you know I don't
think that it's smart that one key not

545
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,110
only gets you into the elevator but like
that key box it had everything else in

546
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:46,410
the building behind it you might not
realize that how often are you like

547
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,120
auditing this stuff in your building how
often are you checking out what key

548
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,029
boxes are holding what

549
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:56,939
nobody checks the stuff nobody thinks
about this stuff but the industry can

550
00:37:56,939 --> 00:38:02,019
tell you most buildings is very easy to
get around places one of the things the

551
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:09,589
industry could tell you and again do not
do this in the whole story itself the

552
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:14,140
host way doors at every floor it's not
easy to like open those if you're

553
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,189
standing in the hallway right if you're
on the inside if you're in the shaft do

554
00:38:19,189 --> 00:38:26,199
you think there's any security on those
doors know this is us on one floor my

555
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,679
mom hated this video

556
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,929
this is us on a lower floor trying to go
to a higher floor now we're not doing

557
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:36,019
anything that's actually to code here
with this is not the right way to seize

558
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:42,158
a car top and such but we are waiting
for the elevator to pass by happening to

559
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,729
catch it in the hoist way because if you
break the safety string circuit like by

560
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:49,069
popping those doors which I'm not going
to tell you how we did that by popping

561
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:52,339
those doors the elevator stops the motor
just stops running at sparks the

562
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:57,999
elevator temporarily we are now by the
way we are now in the head in the shower

563
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:03,019
so now this elevator which all have a
light on top movies it's you know not

564
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:08,738
that dark in there if you have the light
turned on they have a car top Run box we

565
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:12,469
can now take over the case if you are on
top of the elevator you don't want to do

566
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:17,039
something you're not expecting so there
are car top run controls and we are now

567
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,140
able to drive this elevator anywhere in
this building secure environment you

568
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,348
shouldn't be able to move the elevator
at all but from the car top there is no

569
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:28,229
security there is by code and by design

570
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:32,658
no security so let's go ahead and go up
a few floors here

571
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:38,479
alright coming by again and you should
be able to see as we start to get out

572
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:45,959
all it is to pop these doors there's the
interlock black no log event no badge

573
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:51,069
event no audit trail because the
elevator was on inspection service just

574
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:54,190
ended down there we are in the next
flora

575
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,960
crazy crazy stuff and by the way did I
tell you not to do that because I'm

576
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,650
telling you not to do that this is my
don't do that face if you can get into

577
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,970
the machine room itself a nefarious
party someone who is accessing the

578
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,390
controller directly you can completely
change parameters you can change

579
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,759
settings you can change lockouts change
access hours you can sometimes just

580
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,310
direct drive and say no this elevator
goes to the floor now because I tell it

581
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:26,190
to you can remake the universe so to
speak from a machine room you can use

582
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:31,250
what are called jumpers jumpers are just
you know little alligator clips of wire

583
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:36,180
that you can actually bridge certain
interlock circuits this is how elevator

584
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,160
tests are performed elevators every five
years like your semiannual annuals the

585
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,350
five-year tests you literally crash in
elevator down into its pitfalls to see

586
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:49,790
if the pit buffer is working correctly
and the elevator supposed to withstand

587
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,170
that impact and elevators never supposed
to over speed it's never saw the

588
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,700
governor should stop it it should never
go past its finals in the low landing

589
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:04,819
how do you do that by literally jumping
out those contacts

590
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:10,180
any semi carbon elevator tech if they're
in the machine room can make an elevator

591
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,520
do that with no difficulty

592
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,690
do you think when the president like
gets on an elevator he just walks onto

593
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,020
an elevator know their art elevator text
and secret service in the motor room

594
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,130
anytime the president is getting on
welfare because if somebody in 06 their

595
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,690
hand in the door somebody tries to kill
the power died broke this summer so we

596
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,870
pulled a door open like on another floor
to stop the president's elevators from

597
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:36,029
moving they can jump out all the safety
interlocks just get that elevator where

598
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,720
it needs to go immediately

599
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,560
there was a famous case and you're about
to see something some footage here an

600
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,970
elevator that was jumper incorrectly and
it was able to move and leave the floor

601
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,990
with the door still open so this was a
hospital thank goodness it was a

602
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,089
hospital where someone got hurt she
survived because she was in an elevator

603
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,609
the did that

604
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:58,460
and she was pinned you know she was
dragged a little bit in the way that was

605
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,650
the Deborah jordan case if you're from
New York and that was all because of

606
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:06,430
incorrect jumping now is there a big
leap from like incorrect jumping to

607
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:11,109
malicious jumping I don't know but I bet
you might consider putting a camera or a

608
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:14,500
door sensor on your freakin motor room
door

609
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:20,050
very quickly if you want to just keep
this in mind many elevators have phones

610
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:25,320
what can you do with phones and phone
lines you can do a lot of interesting

611
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,720
things with phones and phone lines these
are standard pots lines these are

612
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,299
regular plain you know

613
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,260
silver satin copper just coming all the
way through the traveler cable into the

614
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,810
elevator cab if you can get to that
phone line

615
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,190
well I mean there's you know like high
school 2600 style fun you can do the

616
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:48,750
bigger implication is not dialing out on
those phones but dialing in on those

617
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,930
phones if you can figure out the phone
number two and elevators emergency phone

618
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,359
many times like I would that be posted I
really have no idea but the thing is

619
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:03,348
most elevator phones they are configured
to on inbound calls to pick up silently

620
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:09,490
at one ring and then just be on the call
so I mean you could be some kind of jerk

621
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:15,890
in like well you could try to freak
people out in an elevator but the bigger

622
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:20,240
security and public employee information
and this has happened in Dec I'm told

623
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,560
when certain delegations are in town
they monitor fondly why is there

624
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,990
activity on that phone line that's an
elevator phone the bigger thing is

625
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:31,979
calling an elevator phone and not saying
anything just listening people have

626
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,590
interesting chatter and elevators
because they think they're alone you may

627
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:39,690
not be alone in an elevator because
again by code your elevator should have

628
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,850
a phone in it and if it's a modernized
elevator it's a phone that anyone can

629
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,660
call in on if they know the number and
it'll just pick up silently and now you

630
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,470
are on a call made without realizing
you're on a call

631
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,230
if you're a building owner building
manager building anything with some

632
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:57,650
juice in that building please understand
they're a really common violations that

633
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,500
the industry is tired of seeing
entrapments being high on the list if

634
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,040
you have an elevator that is getting
people stuck in it and it's ducking all

635
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,470
that happens sometimes we just have to
talk to him in five minutes later the

636
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:15,290
system resets that's wrong right leg you
get that that's wrong people show us on

637
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:19,099
Twitter funny photos all the time of
elevators and say things like sometimes

638
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:22,430
elevator stalls out in between 2nd and
3rd floor wait five minutes I promise

639
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:26,700
you everything is fine do not press
alarm bell that's wrong that's like

640
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,819
driving your car with you know the
engine light on and you're like oh my

641
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,840
god I only drove it that way for two
months now all of a sudden the car blew

642
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,450
up what happened while you had that
engine light on minor shit is the

643
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:40,279
warning signs before big stuff happens

644
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,920
don't have complete hakki repairs like
look at the halo around this fire switch

645
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,380
that somebody took like red sharpie I
guess just marked on off bypass that's a

646
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,340
violation dumb violations are not
something you're always going to get

647
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,370
ticketed for immediately by the way
what's wrong here this is not a button

648
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,670
this is a key switch because they didn't
want someone going to the train platform

649
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:07,040
all well and good except when a fire
responder needs to get a train platform

650
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,450
what are they gonna do

651
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:12,399
you are not in trouble just because
you've kinda done something stupid many

652
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,800
times you get like come on you really
get that fixed yo it's not that you're

653
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,650
worried about the municipal violation in
the write-up worried about the incident

654
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,640
when it happens is if an incident
majorly happens and we are a litigious

655
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,950
society if stuff was in violation in
that cab someone's going to find it and

656
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:33,710
you are going to pay for it if you don't
have a proper emergency phone emergency

657
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,070
speaker like hope someone at the desk
shout that's not how it's supposed to

658
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:38,840
work

659
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,160
the alarm bell how many times the alarm
bell disabled in an elevator really

660
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,080
common stuff the assaults which as we
like to call it

661
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,220
many modernized elevators do not have a
toggle switch for the run stop anymore

662
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,709
because that's why people in elevators
have flipped it and then be like hey

663
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,720
give me your money

664
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,580
hey I want your this I want you that and
what's the other person who's now in the

665
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:04,460
overall inside the panel gonna do if you
saw that one video who is the the wraps

666
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,480
it was it was a Kanye got in a fight
with his girlfriend or something in an

667
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,310
elevator who was it

668
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:13,230
Ray Rice if you actually see that video

669
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:19,100
what happened is they smacked two-run
stop button which was a push by someone

670
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,130
else I think the bodyguards tried to
pull that button back out and the fights

671
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,550
going on because the elevator stopped
dead and in the hustle and bustle it's

672
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:29,440
not easy to get it running again if it's
a regular toggle switch modernize that

673
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,550
ship the actual elevator code for motor
rooms said the doors must be

674
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,810
self-closing self-locking you know
heavy-duty doors does this look

675
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,509
self-closing and self-locking to you

676
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:47,549
this is a chain pulled through the hole
where the deadbolt used to be and you

677
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:51,179
know does this look like a competent
qualified elevator tak going to try to

678
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:55,109
fix a broken elevator in a mall the
elevator had shot it overshot it stopped

679
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:59,049
lending it was on its final limit switch
and they basically like a security guard

680
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:02,519
turn it off and on again so of course
that didn't work but like what is this

681
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,828
guy doing in there why does someone have
a key to that master lock the the

682
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:10,869
motorhome is not a place that you should
be sending any kind of employees if they

683
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,250
don't belong in there

684
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,820
r I love this too like clearly someone
didn't read enough time hatch access do

685
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,170
not touch clearly someone touched

686
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:24,260
why is this being written so much you
are literally sending people in the room

687
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,990
don't belong in that room

688
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,129
know who your contractor is have
oversight of your MCP your maintenance

689
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,020
control program like this is not a
default document this is not a template

690
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,350
right this is literally blank this was
an incident that Howard was called to

691
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:42,920
and they're like okay let's play Rams
didn't even try to fake it they just

692
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,020
literally just not been doing
inspections not been doing maintenance

693
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,910
nothing written up they got bank for
that pretty hard

694
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:53,990
this is another job like why does this
motor room and hydraulic elevator have

695
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:58,669
two giants acts of oil dry what's going
on what's this let's pull the power off

696
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:04,869
look how much hydrofoil this thing is
spring it's filled the its hits hitta so

697
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:10,289
bad it's filled this up so much that the
last inspection tag is literally soaked

698
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:15,789
in hydrofoil that should not be
happening and if you have any sway your

699
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:20,339
building incorporate elevators into your
into your routine checks know what's

700
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:23,720
going on with your elevators know who
servicing them

701
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,779
there's a lot of collusion that can
happen in the wrong kind of place people

702
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,980
saying work has been done and then if
you actually check the tag this isn't a

703
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,500
service tag performed by Otis

704
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,190
unless the guys name was ODIs that's
wrong

705
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,140
who the hell did this test

706
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,450
this was a roping like cable setup that
was replaced after only a few year all

707
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:50,788
your cables are going bad paid $27,000
somebody got into is actually Howard he

708
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:55,510
/ she made into a sub basement found the
original test tag from the seventies and

709
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,890
these cables had never been replaced and
this building owner was just being

710
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,440
slammed for money

711
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,920
if you wind up red tagged you are doing
a lot wrong not just one or two little

712
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,430
things wrong most elevator inspectors
will try to work with you and its major

713
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,879
things that are you work really liable
for if you're getting things this bad in

714
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,160
your system this is my favorite video of
an elevator test this was an attack you

715
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,160
didn't think it would work and he
insisted on filming this final readiness

716
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,410
test and you saw the entire motor
generates pulled off its moorings

717
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:34,080
so that's that's the the hardware side
of the house as far as back to security

718
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,630
please follow your building procedures
please bad people incorrectly and verify

719
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:42,380
their story I've pretended to be the
elevator tackle the fire inspector in

720
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,240
various places if your security guard is
just an elevator you're doing security

721
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,500
wrong

722
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,470
now what do I mean by that will look at
this nice little thing it's a keypad and

723
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,339
a contactless card and some biometric
this is like three different factor

724
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:02,300
authentication right what is it doing
it's in an elevator it's in an elevator

725
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,880
that has fire service mode there is the
jewel it up right there

726
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,040
this was an FBI ok one key where was
this elevator and what was it trying to

727
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,810
prevent people from doing

728
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,670
this is an airport

729
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,930
this is literally going from the
insecurity area up to the sterile area

730
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,460
up to the screen area

731
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:24,570
now you could imagine a test case where
someone is like look what I could do or

732
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,700
you could imagine someone going on ebay
spending $13 and being able to get

733
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,819
anything they want from the ground level
up to the store aisles own look around

734
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,480
places look around your airports look
around your buildings you're gonna see

735
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,640
key boxes were you didn't think you saw
them before looking your elevators and

736
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,730
look in your panel's you're going to see
key switches that you never noticed

737
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:45,870
before

738
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:50,299
there is a difference between your parts
oil and grease stack and an elevator

739
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,980
security consultant if you have real
questions about this

740
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,620
ask me ask howard asked somebody because
as a lot in this industry that nobody's

741
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,730
talking about

742
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:04,390
very very quickly I know I'm right at
the end of one minute to go there are

743
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:07,950
ways to do things securely we get this
question I want my elevator to be

744
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:12,089
monitored but I don't want it on the
internet you can do that right like you

745
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,490
don't have to be using software like
this

746
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,859
there are these are all just dry
contacts these are all just basic loops

747
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,090
of copyright

748
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:25,970
there are at on boards that you can
touch you can plug in an alert your

749
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,890
solar your building system you can learn
your access control system just like if

750
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,259
the server room door opened and there
was no badge events associated with it

751
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,030
why is this elevator going on
independent service and there was no

752
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:41,220
leak is that it's two in the morning why
is that happening you can do logging and

753
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,990
monitoring without screwing things up
without being on the internet it's not

754
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:49,350
that hard you just have to speak to the
right people very last couple of tips

755
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,420
cuz I even if you don't listen to me
before I want you to be safe

756
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:57,250
if you are ever stuck in an elevator
don't panic it's not gonna kill you and

757
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:02,000
I gotta run out of air are the main
lights off power is probably out the

758
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,530
lights on then you know wait if the main
lights are on

759
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,640
first door open sometimes I'll just pop
the doors open if it's not running west

760
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,680
door closed and then press tour open
again plus police calls to other floors

761
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,040
if it's a weird badging glitch or
something try the lobby is usually the

762
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,620
lobby is not locked out make sure your
badged in with your hotel key card

763
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:27,200
employee badge try again sometimes it
timed out weird if you have keys you

764
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,470
know use the key switches of your
authorised last thing be very careful

765
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:35,399
verify the doors are closed with the
flat of your hand

766
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,080
not them into the gap try to verify the
door interlock is fully shut and then

767
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,700
try all these steps again if nothing
works then you call for help

768
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,730
what do you never do you never go
hollywood up the top hatch there's

769
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:50,680
nothing up there that you need to be
messing with just gonna make things

770
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,390
harder is that if you pop the top at the
safety strings broke in the elevator

771
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,790
won't run again when somebody comes to
fix it

772
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:01,920
don't miss leveled car if you have to
jump that is too far we have literally

773
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,880
seen building owners been like dozens
sometimes here I'll let you down

774
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,740
no tellin to F off to get the police
here

775
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,569
like this is a janitor helping people
out of a car that's halfway between

776
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:16,890
floors I would stand the guy is giving
the finger be like nope I'm company get

777
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,200
the cops and write it up

778
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,390
wait for proper responders to show up
the safest place to be is in the cab

779
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:28,049
itself if something is wrong and then
you write up you ticketed and you make

780
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,050
sure that someone in this building tries
to pay attention to something and

781
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,750
hopefully in the end we all lined up a
little more safe than a little more

782
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,950
secure and I went over by a minute but I
thank you very much thank you for

783
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:52,669
listening I don't know if there's no
questions are questions everyone just

784
00:53:52,670 --> 00:54:03,630
wants lunch the pair of the back is it
really true that you can use sim tower

785
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:08,210
to tell how many elevators are needed
that is actually a fun fact that was in

786
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:11,980
the longer version of this we talked
about it hope sim tower was not

787
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,869
originally came by Maxis it was an
elevator simulator like it was a

788
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:20,500
simulating software written i think in
Japan and then maxis like bought it so

789
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,940
yeah I mean how hard he has the original
before they were taken from us he has

790
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:29,990
the original twin towers like it all up
in sim tower with the actual elevators

791
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:35,470
running and maybe even tuned it to be
more efficient any other questions

792
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,270
has anyone noticed you know some
somethings in an elevator that you may

793
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,590
be seen you don't talk about how many
people maybe want to take a better look

794
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:49,910
at your elevator now wish you had some
elevator keys legal told us we can't

795
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:57,118
sell them unless you've been in a one
day safety trainings question areas very

796
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,160
good question and I like is it illegal
to you will even extended is it illegal

797
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,379
to buy sell use possess elevated tees

798
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:11,430
is the answer so most for the most part
no they're not treated as like a

799
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:17,850
restricted device under the law but most
elevator fire code states he shall only

800
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:23,230
be possessed by an authorised party and
many municipalities have adopted code by

801
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:27,540
statute saying the latest revision of
Fire Code shall now be law violation is

802
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,600
a violation of block now the most fire
code I've ever seen always uses vague

803
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:37,029
terms like authorized party they don't
say firefighters and emergency response

804
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:42,320
personnel authorized party if you are
like on a fully scope documented pen

805
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,240
test I would consider that to be you are
an authorised party if you said I'm

806
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,560
going to be interacting with your
elevators because that's what you're

807
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,330
paying me to do among other things you
are authorized in the sense of that

808
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:58,250
building now did the building owner give
you authorization or just like a leasing

809
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:04,130
client if you authorization gray area
talk to legal but for the most part like

810
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,080
you're not committing a crime

811
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,850
probably selling those keys on ebay
other than a local misdemeanor like it

812
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:13,279
some municipal violation but yes they
have your jizz banging around with

813
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,710
elevator keys were you shouldn't be
using them it's probably I'm not a

814
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,970
lawyer it's probably very akin to any
kind of be any or attempted trespass

815
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,339
things like that

816
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:54,789
any other over here so yes thank you

817
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:59,479
so the question is is a presentation
like this likely to be knowledge already

818
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:04,299
possessed by people who do high detail
PPD work force protection Secret Service

819
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:08,729
my bet is that your government side like
secret service is kind of you know your

820
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:15,078
top tier big biceps bills rap star
protection services like your low tier

821
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:19,799
probably your top tier people yes I mean
obviously secret service there are

822
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:23,329
people in the industry have met them
when they've been putting on jobs like

823
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:25,439
you're in the clear in the motor in with
me today

824
00:57:25,439 --> 00:57:30,399
your basic personal protection type
bodyguard type people know they probably

825
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,219
just presume they think they see the
rooms are choke points and you know exit

826
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:37,789
factors so they'll get elevators just
never wise if you're worried about

827
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:41,969
somebody you know it coming in like to
step on you because you wrote a book or

828
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:45,219
something I guess but I don't think that
a lot of people are talking about

829
00:57:45,219 --> 00:57:46,709
exploiting

830
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:52,109
got it was really racist then I think
people like talking about exploiting the

831
00:57:52,109 --> 00:57:57,019
special modes of operation I don't think
this is the kind of content that gets

832
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:00,729
talked about enough you know I am super
thrilled you were gracious enough to

833
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:05,649
listen to me through a lot of different
things at all at once

834
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:09,119
yes anything else was there no it wasn't
there was somebody yelling at me for

835
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:15,789
being rude anyone else I guess that's
having lunch
