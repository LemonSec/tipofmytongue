00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,929
location independent security approach

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,090
or elisa today so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lisa as the</font>

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,129
name implies it's a security approach

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,730
security architecture where we're no

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,529
longer trusting our network location to

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,850
provide access so in other words just

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,740
because you're in our office doesn't

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,529
necessarily mean you get any access to

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">our corporate services instead we're</font>

13
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,308
trusting authenticated users and devices

14
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,480
it shares a lot of principles with

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">google's be on corporate you've heard</font>

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that in the last few years</font>

17
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:40,410
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep provisioning the</font>

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,520
corporate network treating your office

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,800
network as a Starbucks network

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,100
essentially we took a slightly different

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,099
approach to it as you'll as you'll see

22
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,899
so why as any pen tester will tell you

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,670
probably the easiest way into a

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,050
corporate network is to just tailgate

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,539
into the building and<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug in the</font>

26
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,149
network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to shut down that</font>

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,789
pretty easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Avenue into corporate</font>

28
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,600
services we let Netflix we want to

29
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,409
maintain a fairly open campus so maybe

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,720
freedom of movement throughout our

31
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,909
campus we don't want you know big fences

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,860
we don't want man-traps spikes coming

33
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,409
out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor that sort of thing so</font>

34
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,900
moving from physical security focusing

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,170
more on electronic security logical

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,189
security instead also we want our

37
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,360
employees to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work from</font>

38
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,339
anywhere without Geographic restrictions

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,700
so that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same experience</font>

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,040
both in the office out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the office at</font>

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,670

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,950
the same access same experience and help

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,060
accelerate the death of the perimeter

44
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,409
all the cool kids have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been saying for a</font>

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">while now that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perimeter is dead or</font>

46
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,430
dying so we figured why not take it's

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next step and just say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well forget</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the corporate office that's no longer</font>

49
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,070
trusted as well cut just cut that out of

50
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,079
the perimeter so some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the benefits</font>

51
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,579
reduced attack surface so shutting down

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,079
that easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Avenue and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to corporate</font>

into the building because you could be

asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> me well how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys stop</font>

60
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,809
man-in-the-middle attacks you know on

your

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,800
network or even you know on other

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,440
networks and I said okay well you know

64
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,230
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the typical stuff your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP</font>

inspection and DHCP snooping all that

67
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,950
sort of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> yada yada yada but now</font>

68
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,970
that we have Lisa we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really have</font>

69
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,420
to worry about people man in the

70
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,430
middling us anymore it's it's basically

71
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,410
a VPN protecting your connection so

72
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,459
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> commands men</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle you</font>

73
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,410
all day they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get access</font>

74
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the communications the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

75
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:46,069
going to do is toss your ability to

76
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:48,830
connect to the VPN and since everyone's

77
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:51,319
coming into one central point no longer

78
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,819
accessing from from trusted locations

79
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,040
all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place you've got one</font>

80
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,470
central place where you can do often

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,599
occation two-factor authentication

82
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,970
doling out access controlling access and

83
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,349
doing inspection of of all that traffic

84
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,970
with your fancy network security tools

85
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,220
and then also at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same point you can</font>

86
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,440
do endpoint checks you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your</font>

87
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,599
typical you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is the device healthy</font>

88
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,310
as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed is the firewall on is the</font>

89
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:21,018
disk encrypted all that sort of stuff so

90
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,660
another benefit simplified network

91
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,209
architecture so it not only treating

92
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,620
your network I mean the trust level of

93
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network is like a starbucks network</font>

94
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,680
but also simplifying the infrastructure

95
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,480
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean because you maybe you</font>

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,209
don't have that expensive million-dollar

97
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,768
security stack out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your office and</font>

98
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,780
Mongolia because you couldn't justify it

99
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,660
or you couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford it or whatever so</font>

100
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,549
well why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just scrap the one in the</font>

101
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,069
big office as well I mean maybe you'll

102
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to but in theory you could simple</font>

103
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,040
female<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need a 2 to 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X to</font>

104
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,019
protect your ports you don't need all

105
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,940
those you know the ARP inspection all

106
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,519
that sort of stuff and in fancy network

107
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,010
security stack because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font>

108
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,829
inspection and all that control is done

109
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,500
it you at your VPN endpoint be it in

110
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:09,560
cloud or in your data centers if you

111
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,980
have one and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the same</font>

112
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution inside and outside the office</font>

113
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,180
you because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're your expensive</font>

114
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,880
network security stack can't protect

115
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,250
your users when they're at starbucks or

116
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,010
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> regis offices or whatever</font>

117
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,740
office you're renting

118
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,360
this provides the same solution both

119
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,990
here and there and it protects you

120
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,330
equally in both locations a little or no

121
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,840
custom development so most I<font color="#CCCCCC"> teashops</font>

122
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,310
don't have a bunch of developers on hand

123
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,989
like some certain other large

124
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,080
corporations to just throw at this and

125
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,580
write a custom solution so we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

126
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,109
commercial off-the-shelf software like

127
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,930
most people would do and just bolted it

128
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,700
together I mean it's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

129
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,790
magic to see here it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stuff</font>

130
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody can do and because you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing any custom development you're not</font>

132
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,710
tied to a specific sort of specific set

133
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,830
of supported vendors so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

134
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,590
swap out VPN vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you swap out to</font>

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">fa vendors or what have you you don't</font>

136
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,469
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rewrite a bunch of integrations</font>

137
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,869
and custom develop and all that sort of

stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint checks so at Netflix were</font>

oh well so manage your own device so

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are free to go out to the apple</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">store grab their own device and then</font>

start using it for accessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflix</font>

managing their systems it's more about

150
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,940
giving them the freedom to do what they

151
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,230
need to use whatever device they want to

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:56,590
making sure it's you know if it meets

155
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:59,950
our standards and so the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

gathering from the endpoint checks and

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,420
from VPN logins and internal application

158
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,160

services like people were just using

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,460
google apps or slack or what have you

193
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:36,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">methodology so when you plug into our</font>

194
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,318
corporate network all you get is

195
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,750
internet access and VPN access you don't

196
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,819
get anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else one of the big ones</font>

197
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that shocks people is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't even</font>

00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk two devices next to you say your</font>

200
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:57,370
had in the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you also can't</font>

201
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:59,479
talk to other subnets in the building<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

202
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,099
luckily with most of our users this

203
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,139
wasn't an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they've already</font>

204
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:06,099
been pushed to move everything they can

205
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:11,240
up into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon but for some other</font>

206
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:13,849
companies this may be a bigger issue and

207
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,490
then if you want to access<font color="#E5E5E5"> private</font>

208
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:20,050
resources in AWS or your data center you

209
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to the VPN</font>

210
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:28,930
so one big thing is remembering to

211
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,520
remove building whitelists from AWS in

212
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,380
your data center your applications

213
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,750
everywhere you possibly can because you

214
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're going to no longer trust</font>

corporate network you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

216
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,630
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trusting it in every</font>

217
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,070
possible spot you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

218
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,080
maybe maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you blocked it in your</font>

219
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,630
firewall going over to your data center

220
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,310
but you forgot that there's you know

221
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,710
when traffic goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the internet and</font>

222
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,959
comes out<font color="#CCCCCC"> as your public IP going to</font>

223
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,470
your public facing stuff well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be</font>

224
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,110
building it some special extended access

225
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,150
to either<font color="#E5E5E5"> test and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dev resources or you</font>

226
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,710
know it bypasses some off checks or

227
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,560
something like that so you want to get

228
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that out of there as well and don't</font>

229
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget redundancy in circular</font>

230
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,880
dependencies so when you're funneling

231
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">every one to one point into your</font>

232
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,439
corporate environment you kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna</font>

233
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,420
have some redundancy so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

234
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">course have your redundant VPN stack</font>

235
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,770
then also have it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple locations</font>

236
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:29,319
and don't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> circular dependencies</font>

237
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:31,810
where you know say<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your VPN goes</font>

238
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,850
down or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're off provider goes down</font>

239
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:37,420
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you then can't off into the VPN</font>

240
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:39,610
so everyone's screw you may want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

241
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,560
a secure location on site behind a

locked door all that sort of stuff to

243
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,790
bypass some of these rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can</font>

244
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,120
get in and fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in case of an</font>

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">emergency collecting use cases how do</font>

246
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,960
you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> all them so as scary as it was</font>

247
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,400
for me I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out from behind my</font>

248
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,920
monitor I had to go talk to people in

<font color="#E5E5E5">real life so it helps to go find those</font>

250

organization for a long time they've got

252
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,290
all sorts of tribal knowledge that's

253
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:10,240
really helpful look for interesting

254
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,290
branches in the org chart you know okay

255
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,760
well these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys all do pretty much</font>

256
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,439
normal stuff but this one looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

257
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">little odd corner case or these people</font>

258
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">look like snowflakes let's go talk to</font>

259
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,620
them talking to directors and saying hey

260
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,150
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use cases we found do</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you by these do you know of anyone</font>

264
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,980
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might not meet these use cases</font>

265
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,199
you know getting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there making</font>

friends finding that guy in the basement

267
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,769
with the suspenders in the beard talking

268

to him

269
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:39,989
he's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice guy luckily for us</font>

270
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:42,089
most people at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix only need</font>

271
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:45,809
internet and VPN access so that kept

272
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,429
things fairly simple for us but consumer

273
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:49,199
electronic devices so I know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

274
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,999
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard but netflix has this cool app</font>

275
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:53,359
that runs on TVs lets you stream movies

276
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:57,420
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff from the internet check it out</font>

277
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,029
the problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that so say TV</font>

278
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,059
vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> X goes and develops their their</font>

279
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,589
netflix app and they throw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the TV</font>

280
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">they ship us the TV and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they say hey can</font>

281
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:09,449
you guys bless this do your magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> checks</font>

282
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,759
and whatever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it's good to</font>

283
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:13,529
go and so we bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on site and we run</font>

284
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,170
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of tests and say yeah it's good</font>

285
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay go for it now with Lisa with</font>

286
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything needing VPN to get access to</font>

287
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:25,649
corporate services last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I checked</font>

288
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:28,199
no TV support VPN so damn it there's a

289
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:30,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem and then also during these tests</font>

290
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:32,670
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes the the TV needs to</font>

291
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:34,170
talk to say similar device like the

292
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,498
engineers laptop it's writing some code

293
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,809
or their their phone needs to screencast

294
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:41,850
to the TV something like that so that's

295
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:43,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">also blocked because of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the device</font>

296
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,869
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> device local subnet communications</font>

297
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:48,269
are blocked so creating exceptions

298
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:50,040
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of snowflakes so we've got</font>

299
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">two exception networks we've got one</font>

300
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,339
which is limited Amazon access for

301
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,470
testing these consumer electronic

302
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:58,319
devices just accessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> devon test</font>

303
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,850
resources so the TV can talk to a test

304
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:03,299
harness or can talk to the server where

305
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,819
it's got some code running on it the

306
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:08,309
second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for full</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon access</font>

307
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:09,689
this one is our scary network that we'd

308
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,910
like to control very tightly because

309
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:15,019
it's basically bypassing all these

310
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,969
protections we set in place so it's

311
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:19,589
people on there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually on there</font>

312
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">because of VPN client limitations</font>

313
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:24,119
because say for some reason your vendor

314
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,790
doesn't have feature parity between

315
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:30,509
Windows and Linux that would never

316
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:33,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen or high throughput stuff so say</font>

317
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:35,999
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding guys need to</font>

318
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:38,639
download terabytes of video from amazon

319
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:39,869
and play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it on their laptops when</font>

320
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,459
they're used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend good connection</font>

321
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:43,290
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> download that stuff or then suddenly</font>

322
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:47,319
you stuff them over VPN it's maybe not

323
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:49,370
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much 10 gigs they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get upset</font>

324
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,650
so with these networks you want to

325
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,060
review access and track it and

326
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,890
automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> be provision it so we've</font>

327
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,689
got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> signup form of people can sign up</font>

328
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,040
and request access and we kind of just

329
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,970
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> envy check in and say okay yeah go</font>

330
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,650
for it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we track</font>

331
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,210
all those and automatically d provision

332
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,130
their access if they haven't used it for

333
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,720
a while I will King them and say hey do

334
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,170
you still need this that kind of thing

335
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,550
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long term these networks</font>

336
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,439
will go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we're working on</font>

337
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,170
some small custom linux boxes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

338
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,120
you can plug the box and say on on the

339
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lisa network or at home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or wherever and</font>

340
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,370
then you off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that box so you can plug</font>

341
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,290
in and then that'll get you over VPN the

342
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,990
corporate services so that will take

343
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,300
care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these these TVs and all that</font>

344
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,980
sort of stuff so I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> visual guy like</font>

345
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">diagram started the words a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

346
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,150
but it's just kind of over it's an

347
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,160
overview here so here's the corporate

348
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,079
network with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your workstation services</font>

349
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,730
are allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> access the internet and</font>

350
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,700
VPN and that's the VPN that's how you

351
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,020
get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to private Amazon resources</font>

352
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,090
and then once you're on VPN you can then

353
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,550
come down<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the corporate network to</font>

354
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:55,880
access other devices on the on the

355
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,500
corporate on the office network and then

356
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,330
here on the exception network you can

357
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,430
talk device the device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can</font>

358
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:06,730
talk to only<font color="#E5E5E5"> test and development</font>

359
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:10,339
resources there and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

360
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,870
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's not allowed so device</font>

361
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,670
to device communication talking to

362
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,290
corporate resources for have an AWS

363
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,949
resources when you're not on VPN and

364
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:22,870
then these two these two subnets can't

365
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,950
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other so pilot networks</font>

366
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,870
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than flipping</font>

367
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,070
the switch on go live day and having

368
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,510
people just standing outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

369
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,990
cube with a bunch of pitchforks and

370
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,340
torches so set up some pilot networks

371
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,020
ahead of times that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can test out</font>

372
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,330
their use cases make sure everything is

373
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,420
hunky-dory with them working<font color="#E5E5E5"> out minor</font>

374
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:44,090
issues you know hey the VPN client

375
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,250
doesn't do this or hey I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

376
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to this make sure those get</font>

377
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,850
fitted into these cases tuning workflows

378
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,410
because people are going to have to you

379
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,640
know add a couple steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their day or</font>

380
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,329
they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to off in the beginning of</font>

381
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,680
the morning

382
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,710
what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting them used to</font>

383
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,089
the new the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of doing things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

384
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,380
then tuning documentation because if

385
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,760
you're going to be communicating out to

386
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,110
everybody hey here's the three steps you

387
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,630
need to take to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready for this and</font>

388
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot part of step 2 or they crash</font>

389
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">and burn on step three because they</font>

390
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,560
didn't understand it this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

391
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work all that sort of stuff out</font>

392
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,550
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> hidden use cases no matter how</font>

393
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,860
good you are there will always be that

394
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,180
one use case that somebody either you

395
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,450
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of or everybody else</font>

396
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,459
doesn't think of so getting getting as

397
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,490
much of those out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the woodwork during</font>

398
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,020
during the the pilot<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network phase is</font>

399
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best way to go and then of course</font>

400
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's always going to be that one that</font>

401
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of on go live day so</font>

402
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,870
being prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

403
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,950
quickly is pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best force</font>

404
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,760
let's see so for automated deep

405
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:50,890
provisioning we pull the switches and

406
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,530
ask them hey what are all the interfaces

407
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,630
on this exception VLAN and then the

408
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,880
interface description has the jack

409
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of the wall jack number on it so</font>

410
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,580
then from there we can tie over to the

411
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,189
cube number and then the cube number we

412
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,290
can match to a user in our HR database

413
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,640
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> from there we can email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

414
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,860
user and say hey do you still need this

415
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,390
jack so every six months or whatever or

416
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,550
automatically you provision it if they

417
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:19,780
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> respond or if it's the jack go</font>

418
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:22,780
dead for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while communication so this</font>

419
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:25,240
is always fun part so at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix to get</font>

420
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,100
a big project started leadership writes

421
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,410
a memo about<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey here's the project here</font>

422
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,930
the idea here's what we're going to do

423
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,890
and then they get every all the

424
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,689
engineering leadership together and

425
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,970
what's called text rat or<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

426
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">strategy sort of meeting and so they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sit</font>

427
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,840
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and first I read the memo and</font>

428
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,220
they debate everything and come up with

429
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,280
a final solution you know tweak tweak

430
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:49,720
the memo tweak the plan and then there's

431
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,010
a kickoff and so then you have to make

432
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,070
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pulled an r18 get the right</font>

433
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,120
resources resources involved so for us

434
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">security was leading this so of course</font>

435
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,320
getting in right people from security

436
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,460
then getting the network team because

437
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're course going to be implementing</font>

438
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,810
all this getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk involved</font>

439
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,360
because they're going to be dealing with

440
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the users who say hey</font>

441
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,938
VPN screwing up today<font color="#CCCCCC"> or I can't access</font>

442
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,319
this or whatever and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

443
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,270
people who are on going to be on the

444
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,790
exception networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're</font>

445
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,129
probably your your biggest customers

446
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,079
everyone else will particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

447
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,760
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but then it's always</font>

448
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,209
those those corner cases that you'll be

449
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,950
want to communicate the most with

450
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,570
targeted emails so and Netflix we don't

451
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like doing blast emails to the</font>

452
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,950
entire company because people tend to

453
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,770
get alert fatigue or maybe just ignore

454
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,169
them so we went with<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused emails of</font>

455
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,059
hey user<font color="#E5E5E5"> X we saw you use this service</font>

456
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:44,370
in the last 30 days you're going to be

457
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">affected in this way so please do these</font>

458
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,530
four steps to prepare and that helped

459
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,910
people realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this applies</font>

460
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:55,070
specifically to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should do these</font>

461
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:58,799
things this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is coming that sort of thing</font>

462
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:01,320
flyers and strategic locations so what

463
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the one strategic location that</font>

464
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,379
everyone uses unless you're some sort of

465
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,659
freakish camel the bathroom yes so we

466
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,880
put flyers up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bathroom doors</font>

467
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,730
pointing to a bunch of project resources

468
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,290
such as our approval group where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

469
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,549
can ask questions our slack channel

470
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,530
where people can ask questions our Q&A

471
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,299
document with questions naturally a

472
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,520
website with various steps and

473
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,929
information hell we even like take

474
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,530
postcards that people want to contact us

475
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:30,390
that way and then so we also had some

476
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">in-person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> options where we had town</font>

477
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">halls so people this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was where a couple</font>

478
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">times where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I come in and present and</font>

479
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,860
say hey here's here's an overview of

480
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,030
Lisa here's how it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to affect</font>

481
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,409
these different groups do you have any

482
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:45,059
questions that was fairly successful

483
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,309
office<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours we're kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like in in</font>

484
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,440
college<font color="#E5E5E5"> or university the professor sits</font>

485
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,899
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you know an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hour every week and</font>

486
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can come in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nass questions so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

487
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,570
that and then also a war room the day of

488
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,460
originally we were gonna do our war room

489
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,990
kind of next<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our little area but we</font>

490
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">decided oh well actually let's move it</font>

491
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,630
down to where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> help desk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is so we're</font>

492
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,220
kind of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trenches with everybody</font>

493
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,870
seeing all the issues coming in kind of

494
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,830
keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> our finger</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the pulse Matt</font>

495
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:13,559
worked out<font color="#CCCCCC"> really well and then did you</font>

496
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,439
get everyone because you're not blasting

497
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,270
the email out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire company can</font>

498
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,029
you be sure you got everyone well I mean

499
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,309
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these options</font>

500
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:25,470
it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> thorough pretty thorough but</font>

501
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:27,360
there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be somebody or</font>

502
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,760
some group that will make you cry<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

503
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,080
the day I almost cried because somebody

504
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,700
passed me in the hall<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said hey Brian</font>

505
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,939
what's what's at least the thing about

506
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,649
like did you do me the flyers like no I

507
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:43,740
saw the firefighter next agreed what it

508
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:45,689
said anyway so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our office hours I had</font>

509
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,149
a stack of beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I had this sign out</font>

510
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,100
to attract some attention that's one way

511
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:52,860
to draw people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in free beer is always</font>

512
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,990
good I most look really intimidating

513
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,959
because nobody took that beer except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

514
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,840
a couple coworkers maybe they're just

515
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,289
ran humoring me but anyway I wasn't that

516
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad rob you don't even like their</font>

517
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:11,190
branding so any cool project at netflix

518
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,260
has to have a logo and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had one of</font>

519
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">our internal you I guys do up some do</font>

520
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:19,080
apple logo here and so we had as you can

521
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">see on my laptop Lisa stickers we had</font>

522
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,699
Lisa shirts we had least<font color="#CCCCCC"> attends we had</font>

523
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,549
Lisa flamethrowers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spaceballs reference</font>

524
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,139
for you it<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps with the the messaging</font>

525
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:29,639
the branding tying everything together

526
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,649
tying in the different you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

527
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flyers and the website and the email and</font>

528
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:38,309
everything if you want stickers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

529
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:42,570
some left let me know so quick little

530
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:44,279
comparison to be on corp so<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool as I</font>

531
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,629
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a lot of developers and a</font>

532
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,799
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of resources to deal with these kind</font>

533
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,080
of problems so they wrote their own

534
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,389
custom really thorough really awesome

535
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,120
solution but it's a lot more work it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

536
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:55,649
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> custom it's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more involved</font>

537
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">requires a lot more resources they also</font>

538
00:20:55,649 --> 00:21:01,168
have strong really strong endpoint

539
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:02,730
controls they used a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of pki they</font>

540
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:05,070
also have stronger centralized

541
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,210
management of their end points they

542
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,799
exposed a lot of their apps to the

543
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and putting proxies in front of</font>

544
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:14,100
them rather than using VPN so Lisa had

545
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:15,899
some some of the same basic principles

546
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,340
but we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> we went about a different</font>

547
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:20,250
route of achieving this so you get the

548
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,199
same same basic features but a smaller

549
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,299
feature set and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

550
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,610
achievable for most companies especially

551
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,899
small companies and if you still want to

552
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to beyond fork down the road this</font>

553
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:34,559
could be a nice stepping stone to it

554
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,559
that's it any questions
