00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thanks sorry for hearing me again I'll</font>

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,370
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stock is something that</font>

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,960
we've been in bar and I are thinking

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,389
about these kind of things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while</font>

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and we started talking with a bunch</font>

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,820
of other people it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well in</font>

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,480
this philosophy track but I think it's

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,619
mostly actionable for the operations one

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,119
and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,539
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some gap that we're</font>

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,809
seeing that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really addressed</font>

12
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:36,000
about business logic abused it is highly

13
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,559
related also to wear a lot of the

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,680
applications are moving to when talking

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">about like serverless and and platform</font>

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,840
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service where there isn't a network</font>

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,640
there isn't a server where most of the

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,940
hackers can can gain benefit from it and

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's the problem that we're seeing</font>

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,649
again when talking about web application

21
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,449
and where a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business impact</font>

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,989
is moving a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of when talking about</font>

23
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,548
website again less enterprise but most

24
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,560
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are doing are</font>

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:13,409
through applications today and and there

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,369
are a lot of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exploit an</font>

27
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,930
application and to get what you want is

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,170
an attacker without actually getting

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,590
control over the system over<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you</font>

30
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,320
don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hack into a server where</font>

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,020
you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use some some flowing</font>

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,770
the logic of the application or off of

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,899
what you're doing scraping of data you

34
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,329
don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hack into the database to</font>

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,369
get a dumb of the database a lot of the

36
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">data is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually available online you</font>

37
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,750
can be smart about how you can get it it

38
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,460
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a countess or account takeover</font>

39
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,350
all kind of credential stuffing

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,149
enumeration of stuff applications are

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,369
open to the world and in many cases if

42
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,710
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't put the right security</font>

43

measures on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business side then</font>

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,298
people can abuse it and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things</font>

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,960
that we're seeing and these are things

46
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,420
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always accountable for and</font>

49
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:19,549
in this in a security community there is

50
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,730
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong bias to network security</font>

56
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,239
product guys they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really think</font>

57
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,489
security wise so there might be logical

58
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,069
flows that are just available there and

59
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:48,090
bad guys can actually get money by doing

60
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:52,379
that by owning accounts by by getting

61
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,720
data by using that information and in

62
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:58,560
many cases there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no traditional</font>

63
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,409
breach no no user no malicious actor

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,180
actually infiltrator your network no one

65
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:11,489
got control over the server so if

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:14,760
someone implementation of off login is

67
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,970
not it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 nobody hacks the server but</font>

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,019
maybe your customers credentials are

69
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:26,010
being abused by by guessing them from

70
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:29,579
millions of different IPS well it's not

71
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:33,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">a security breach but it does have a</font>

72
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,400
huge business impact and and basically

73
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we're saying is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or what we feel is</font>

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there is some lack of ownership the</font>

75
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:46,079
business people don't necessarily

76
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand that and and then the the</font>

77
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,739
security people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really see any</font>

78
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,010
flowing the implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

79
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,440
security and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of in many cases</font>

80
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,500
for the organization's son there's some

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,290
like in e-commerce where the entire

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,090
business of the company is the

83
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,578
application then there is awareness for

84
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,340
that but in many<font color="#CCCCCC"> other places basically</font>

85
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:11,069
ends up being the CEO the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be</font>

86
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,030
losing money attackers might be gaining

87
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:16,909
benefit by by fraud again an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font>

88
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,849
click fraud marketing are spending money

89
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:22,349
spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> out all over and nobody really</font>

90
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:24,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">cares</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about everyone is doing his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

91
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:29,009
nobody is accountable for that

92
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:33,960
until you go to the CEO level and nobody

93
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:36,030
sees<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as an ownership so some of the</font>

94
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,849
actionable that's that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking of</font>

95
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:43,080
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we're trying to figure</font>

96
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">out is it some something new we should</font>

97
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,580
do is it some some some accountability<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

98
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,830
mean first of all figuring out are we

99
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,840
vulnerable is your organization

100
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,169
vulnerable to this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack is</font>

101
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,659
your application why what will an

102
00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,419
attacker gain by by doing such a thing

103
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,760
what are the financial benefits<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

104
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,580
that they made yet which are very

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,770
different than the traditional security

106
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,389
you won't see that in the access logs to

107
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,880
server is it's not as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> state it's not</font>

108
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:16,770
logging to the devices but what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

109
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:20,490
get is it competing against you is it a

110
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,169
gaining access or enumerate incredible

111
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,440
and credit cards on the black market

112
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:28,169
again b/ci on I'm completely covered

115
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,320
my my credit card but I do let some bad

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,229
guy test millions of different stolen

117
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,500
credit cards through my my site and

118
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,979
basically abuse me and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> my business</font>

119
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,659
might be shut down by these our<font color="#CCCCCC"> bye-bye</font>

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:51,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">MX or MasterCard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bakes saying that hey</font>

121
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're we're getting way too much fraud</font>

122
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,000
from from your application so what are

123
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the vulnerabilities and how can we</font>

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,070
educate the organization to think about

125
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,080
that to figure out where an attacker can

126
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,900
abuse my business logic in my

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,639
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> now i don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's a</font>

128
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,810
new type of ownership if it's a new type

129
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,789
of business logic security business

130
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,979
application definitely something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

131
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:20,039
will need as we move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> server list as</font>

132
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,139
we move to a place where everything is

133
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,240
basically logic implemented somewhere

134
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,979
you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,289
itself but you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect your</font>

136
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,930
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the logic and how it</font>

137
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:33,630
impacts thinking about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure</font>

138
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,150
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's where</font>

139
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,840
security will move to or if it's again a

140
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,880
new

141
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,070
roll that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out in</font>

142
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,100
organization and and define the owner

143
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,650
but but we definitely need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to raise more</font>

144
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">awareness to that figure out how to</font>

145
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,099
measure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measure the</font>

146
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,380
impact the interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is they say</font>

147
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">unlike or I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can like</font>

148
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,409
but America is in security it's quite

149
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:01,410
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to measure the exact business</font>

150
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,139
impact or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the financial impact of</font>

151
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,840
the breach there is like usually it's

152
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">like everything is down if my servers</font>

153
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,859
are being taken over<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a catastrophic</font>

154
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,359
thing it's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> life insurance event</font>

155
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,310
and here they're like a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

156
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are actually very measurable if</font>

157
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:22,919
someone is stealing my my users and and

158
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,919
impacting or can do fraud by by gaining

159
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,909
control over them or buying things on my

160
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,109
site there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very measurable</font>

161
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,560
financial impact know that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone is</font>

162
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:37,020
frauding my my advertising and causing

163
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,870
me to pay to publishers more than I need

164
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> highly measurable so this is</font>

165
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually one of the benefits that we can</font>

166
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:47,400
measure that we can look what is the

167
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:49,590
impact and educate the the rest of the

168
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,260
business to be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of that I</font>

169
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,900
don't know what's necklace is again more

170
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,440
of a call for brainstorming or call for

171
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,690
awareness where we're extremely

172
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,820
interested about that we do see that

173
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,030
many organizations that were advising to

174
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,849
or working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lacking that</font>

175
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,590
functionality and and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

176
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:14,909
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to educate how to work</font>

177
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:21,450
raise more awareness to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

178
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:27,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from all right yeah so open for</font>

179
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:27,979
questions or giving you back time yeah

180
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,940
hm

181
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,840
huh

182
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,440
yeah and and it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> attackers do</font>

183
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,170
what they typically do they identify

184
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,600
gaps where they can or arbiter I've

185
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,189
where they can so<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,560
and they can make money out of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

187
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,510
these gaps are there and in many cases

188
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,969
it's just like impacting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

189
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,770
seeing issues with analytics fraud so

190
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you're trying to measure</font>

191
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,730
conversions or actions of users so that

192
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,250
you can optimize<font color="#CCCCCC"> your product and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

193
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,740
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is messing up things and sending</font>

194
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,930
a simulated traffic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

195
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,480
converting you're paying for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

196
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're also losing visibility to your</font>

197
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,800
business metrics so you can make a

198
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,430
knowledgeable decision there is a huge

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,079
potential monetary impact but<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody is</font>

200
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,489
really aware of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

201
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,040
marketers are just looking at the

202
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:57,540
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really verify how</font>

203
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,120
how much of the quality it's garbage in

204
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> garbage out and it's very similar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

205
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,470
that sense to the data that we're

206
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,819
collecting from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security point of</font>

207
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,910
view again if we're collecting garbage

208
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,520
if someone is messing up our logs the

209
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,760
same impact is now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to marketers</font>

210
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,939
and they're way less technical than we

211
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,590
are and the potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the business is</font>

212
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,050
much higher and and there are a bunch of

213
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,850
things spam someone spamming your site

214
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,829
it will impact your<font color="#E5E5E5"> reputation people</font>

215
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,110
will just go away so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,180
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> around it that are in the</font>

217
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:37,560
application that will just hurt your

218
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:38,520
brand and hurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> your business okay thank</font>

219
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,000
you
