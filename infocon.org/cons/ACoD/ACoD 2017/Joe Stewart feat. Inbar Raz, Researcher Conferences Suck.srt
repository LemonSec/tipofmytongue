<font color="#CCCCCC">okey really so a PowerPoint karaoke is</font>

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:16,590
presentation that you've never<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">before and apparently there is no no</font>

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,320
keynote so we're just gonna let me just

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:37,680
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm giving somebody</font>

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,910
else's presentation I'm going to hold

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this just because it's probably being</font>

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,980
recorded although I should be speaking

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:51,230
loud enough you know what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to stay</font>

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,260
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so why do research</font>

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,669
conferences suck it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,608
presentation that was written by Joe

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:05,010
Stewart and it's narrated by me so let's

18
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:08,850
go why do i suck at networking first of

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">all a lot of us are introverted right</font>

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,250
this is why we got into this profession

21
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,990
anyway that what enabled us to put it in

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,670
so much time as you guys know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font>

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,439
at least 10,000 hours to be really

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good at something and we all</font>

25
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,130
we've all put that in being bad at small

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,390
talk what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small talk you come</font>

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,560
to a conference what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk about you</font>

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,759
talk about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> job to talk about the</font>

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">other guy's job to talk about the</font>

30
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,369
weather the stakes in Texas what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,470
do and I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer not me in</font>

32
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,770
particular it's joe but a lot of the

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,369
conference's revolve around beer or even

34
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">today we have the happy hour and people</font>

35
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,530
who don't drink find it awkward because

36
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,670
what did they do there there are too

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,920
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have a one-on-one</font>

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,630
discussion and you try to have it with

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,939
everybody else we are around hundred and

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,869
fifty people here and you can have a

41
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,729
one-on-one with 149 not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

42
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">combinatory speaking a one fit but</font>

43
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,560
because you don't really you don't have

44
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">what to say to all those people right</font>

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as joe says he's bad at this to</font>

46
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,170
begin with so having not just 110

47
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,840
one but 149 that's really not a nice

48
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,730
thing name tags we all hate name tags

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,300
they're all too small they're all

50
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,340
awkwardly located we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to looking</font>

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,200
people at the eyes when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk to them</font>

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,940
and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden you know lowering</font>

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,109
your eyes kind of brings in the

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,190
admission that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know who</font>

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,670
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to you have to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

56
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:38,520
their name that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice and the</font>

57
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,010
social time the<font color="#CCCCCC"> after-hour usually go to</font>

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,830
a bar so some people have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

59
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's all so noisy that it doesn't</font>

60
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,220
work out very well so why is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

61
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,560
why I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> a maior probably every one of</font>

62
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,270
you at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conference want to do some</font>

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,870
networking with people who do similar

64
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,280
work this is what brings us<font color="#E5E5E5"> all together</font>

65
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,630
we want to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from each other I want</font>

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know what tools you guys are using</font>

67
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and maybe show you the tools that I'm</font>

68
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,070
using and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> establish informal sharing</font>

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,720
relationships now the wording formal is

70
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,440
very important here because as you

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,459
probably know setting up formal links

72
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,010
sometimes it's very hard to do there's

73
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">all bureaucracy are you allowed to talk</font>

74
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,459
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that other person are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to</font>

75
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,730
share that piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information and when</font>

76
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,730
we meet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we drink or eat and</font>

77
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,709
then we know each other then we can make

78
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,140
the links much faster and just help each

79
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,350
other at the distance of an email or a

80
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,540
phone call so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give free i want</font>

81
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,609
to get free or cheap stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,100
help help me hurt the bad guys if

83
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:44,010
someone is sharing something tools or or

84
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,160
some information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away free</font>

85
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,480
stuff that will help others and it's too

86
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,940
small you can probably not see that but

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's saying is don't be</font>

88
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,380
an asshole<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if I give you free</font>

89
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,000
stuff don't commercially wrap it and

90
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,430
then sell it and if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me free</font>

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,530
stuff don't start charging me after I've

92
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,920
already established a system that is

93
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,350
dependent on that so we need to think we

94
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,809
need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mechanism to enables us</font>

95
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,510
to get over<font color="#E5E5E5"> these difficulties and start</font>

96
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,670
talking to each other and like he says

97
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:19,469
he wishes that there were a tinder app

98
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,440
for researcher meetings anyone challenge

99
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,320
accepted

100
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so what do we have something</font>

101
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,460
simple something like share<font color="#CCCCCC"> it through a</font>

102
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,590
little slide deck that says who you are

103
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,039
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you do what you're looking for</font>

104
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,770
so here's the proposed format a picture

105
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,840
who you are what's your<font color="#CCCCCC"> email what do</font>

106
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,390
you do what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to offer and</font>

107
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:46,090
what are you looking to get from other

108
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:50,900
people what do you need so I'll go first

109
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:53,109
Joe Stewart right he does or I do now

110
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,900
our research for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dell current focus</font>

111
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">nigerian bc i have low volume malware</font>

112
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,520
feet generated from my bare metal

113
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,850
sandbox what I need is passive DNS

114
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,460
reverse who is and non attributable IP

115
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,280
tunnels and since I'm giving the talk I

116
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,870
took the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity what do i do i'm</font>

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,299
the principal researcher at perimeter x

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm looking for more malicious</font>

124

more malicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome extensions stuff</font>

125
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,080
that is used to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a website</font>

131
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,310
Joe stock I thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

132
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,409
important to set the tone for the

133
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,620
conference so two things we're doing

134
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one you received a link to the</font>

135
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,419
Google slides presentation where you can

136

139
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">essentially pick a corner any corner in</font>

140
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,930
the room and say hey over here anybody

141
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,060
who is interested in sitting down for

142
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,490
lunch and talking about run somewhere

143
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,020
this is what we're doing it trying to

144
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,660
create small circles of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>
