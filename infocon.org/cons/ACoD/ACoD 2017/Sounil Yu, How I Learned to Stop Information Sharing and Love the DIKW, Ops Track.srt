1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
just to kind of give you guys a call to

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,819
action<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I'm</font>

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,039
passionate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm over at the</font>

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,240
philosophy track but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,649
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys something that I think is</font>

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly applicable to you guys in the</font>

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,830
operational track specifically well over

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security this the philosophy track</font>

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,490
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're trying to</font>

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,859
do is to work together in these small

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,750
groups to really push the<font color="#E5E5E5"> field forward</font>

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,939
this is one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys can really contribute in</font>

14
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:35,160
meaningful ways that help you guys right

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,829
so one of the way I characterize this is

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,419
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been I think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sessions</font>

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had previously here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talks</font>

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">about sharing information sharing</font>

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,620
indicators and all kind of stuff I'm

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,328
actually proposing that we stop doing

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:51,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">that okay and instead try to do it a</font>

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,149
different way so i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in frameworks</font>

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,469
and ways and models so i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,020
share with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple different models</font>

25
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,670
to explain why we're proposing what

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,960
we're trying to do so the first model

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,670
that i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you share with you</font>

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,270
is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i called it well what is called</font>

29
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dik w printed dik w data information</font>

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,158
knowledge wisdom data information

31
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,990
knowledge wisdom the other pyramid<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,220
want to share with you is dave Bianco's

33
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,199
pyramid of pain you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys should be</font>

34
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,369
familiar with that lists all these

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,549
different indicators that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about</font>

36
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,439
you map those indicators<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DI KW</font>

37
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,549
pyramid what do you end up with end up

38
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:30,380
with mostly data and information<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what</font>

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:34,590
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really care about we care about</font>

40
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:37,350
how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got that data and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information I</font>

41
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,810
really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care as much about the what</font>

42
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,179
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> found as much as how you found it</font>

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,240
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fundamentally what we if</font>

44
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,159
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to advance our field I</font>

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,259
would want you guys to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to move</font>

46
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,259
towards the how we discovered these

47
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,869
indicators unless about the specific

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,810
indicators that you discovered there's

49
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,070
another framework that we use and it's

50
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,229
what we call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig couple of security</font>

51
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">stack and the decoupled security stack</font>

52
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,130
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to the other loop if</font>

53
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,409
you've ever heard of that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure many</font>

54
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,478
of you guys have but the basic premise

55
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,790
is that we break up our security stack

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,350
into four major components sensing since

57
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,179
making decision making act

58
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,329
something since making<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-making</font>

59
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,760
acting so we map again the dik w pyramid

60
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,520
to the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> sac and what we end up</font>

61
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,269
with is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sensor is obviously data</font>

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,900
and information analytics is the

63
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,820
knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how decisions is a mix of</font>

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,440
the knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the wisdom and then</font>

65
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,150
the action<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you take is back to</font>

66
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,579
basically just information<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what</font>

67
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,690
do we do today now when we look at it

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the the the security sex what we</font>

69
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,040
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do today is basically we</font>

70
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,380
take our sensors and analysts we don't

71
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">really share those okay what we actually</font>

72
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,890
share are the outcomes of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions</font>

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,020
and actions and if you as a receiving

74
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:07,230
organization take action on that

75
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:10,440
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at your own in</font>

76
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,810
at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own risk basically someone's</font>

77
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,730
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey something bad happened</font>

78
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,710
with me when I visit at facebook you

79
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,600
should block facebook too alright

80
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,430
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the foot we learned that</font>

81
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,410
lesson we said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're not</font>

82
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,260
going to do that again instead what we

83
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,750
do is we basically treat it as sensor

84
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,250
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the problem is it's</font>

85
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">very noisy right sure there's some bit</font>

86
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> goodness in there but the vast vast</font>

87
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,880
vast majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very noisy what do</font>

88
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,030
you want to do instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we want to</font>

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">do instead is move to a state where to</font>

90
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,720
some degree we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to actually share</font>

91
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,030
some sensor information but not

92
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,590
everything ok passive DNS is a great

93
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,740
example of what the sensor information

94
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:56,250
that we should be sharing collectively

95
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,810
kudos to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he's around what we</font>

96
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,990
really also<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to share is analytics</font>

97
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,390
we want to show you the how<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

98
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,130
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk talk about sharing</font>

99
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,950
decisions and actions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I blocked</font>

100
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,010
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gives me more context</font>

101
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,109
for may be based on what I see in my

102
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,359
environment based on the analytics and

103
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,430
I'm running<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you shared with me I</font>

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,989
might have better context of what as to

105
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,690
my own decisions i need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

106
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so now the sharing of analytics is</font>

107
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,979
what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propose that we do</font>

108
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,900
all right you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> think well how do we</font>

109
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,000
do that

110
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,489
well actually let me give you an example

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">also when I think about the sharing of</font>

112
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,300
analytics<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus to sharing us but what</font>

113
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,550
we do in lobby these conference

114
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,360
conference is sort of like this it's

115
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">like watching a grandma when she's</font>

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,470
teaching how to cook<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so one of</font>

117
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,530
you guys come up here and basically say

118
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,820
here's how I found badness<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right you</font>

119
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,500
take it a little bit it is take a little

120
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,620
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stir it up tasted a little</font>

121
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:58,310
bit and while I found fancy beer

122
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,669
whatever it is ok but that's really not

123
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,070
very repeatable what we want is a Betty

124
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,539
Crocker version of that well or at least

125
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> written down so that way when</font>

126
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,750
someone says a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit it is you can</font>

127
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,490
say well can you kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

128
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,680
specific in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of what is that little</font>

129
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,639
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all right well fortunately</font>

130
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,830
there are a couple of folks who are

131
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,530
doing this so Dave Bianco he has threat

132
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,150
hunting net and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has a bunch of things</font>

133
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,429
in terms of look if you have these

134
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,539
ingredients here are some really cool

135
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,240
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do with those</font>

136
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,130
ingredients and if you want to try to do

137
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,110
certain goals if you want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

138
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,639
some some of these meals there's

139
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,340
different ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can make those</font>

140
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,470
meals using these ingredients and then

141
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,239
he has somewhat of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Betty classic</font>

142
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,130
version here right saying here's how to

143
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,930
find a web show you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font>

144
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,479
this and take a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

145
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:50,750
hey weeks it's written down<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which</font>

146
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:52,460
is cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dex the next stage though is if</font>

147
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,620
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not familiar my dress cyber</font>

148
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,138
analytic repository this is getting

149
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">closer to that recipe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that Betty</font>

150
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,659
Crocker recipe on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right you have the</font>

151
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:07,039
attack framework that is the attacker

152
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:10,599
TTP ok this is the attacker TTP this is

153
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:14,750
the analyst TTP in the English language

154
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:18,650
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the analyst TTP written down as a</font>

155
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:22,820
recipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok is this recipe format the</font>

156
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:25,638
right one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm maybe maybe not but hey</font>

157
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,880
it's a start<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right and we're trying</font>

158
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,240
to go from grandma's recipe to or

159
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">grandma's description of a meal or a</font>

160
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,320
dish to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual recipe here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

161
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,690
so how do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this all</font>

162
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,460
together let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm going to give you a</font>

163
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick overview of how we will look at</font>

164
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,558
this

165
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,240
if we were to make this a community sort

166
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:47,680
of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of community driven sort of</font>

167
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,300
thing so you have again one of you guys

168
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,159
come up and say hey I found this awesome

169
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,199
way to find intrusions let me tell you

170
00:06:52,159 --> 00:07:00,740
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to turn it</font>

171
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,719
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very explicit way that you can go</font>

172
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">and run it yourself now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's an</font>

173
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:07,219
analytic method that analytic method I'm

174
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:09,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to express in some sort of tooling</font>

175
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:11,058
that is specifically me if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

176
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that same tooling awesome then</font>

177
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:15,430
ready to roll and of course the same

178
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:18,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">tooling and same basic data structures</font>

179
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,199
then you're good to go within<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own</font>

180
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I run that I'll come up</font>

181
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,979
with my own set of indicators I do

182
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,169
actually call them by products and

183
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,860
byproducts here in the context of

184
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:34,370
recipes the byproduct is not the meal

185
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:37,219
it's the broken egg shells<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's the</font>

186
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,289
residue butter<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

187
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,120
that you don't eat throw away but we

188
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,998
don't throw it away we say hey you guys

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,339
want some of my residue or my<font color="#CCCCCC"> by-product</font>

190
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:48,169
and I would even go as far as calling

191
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:52,009
the waste products what you want my

192
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,839
waste products probably not but hey a

193
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:57,050
lot of other communities do so we share

194
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,839
those okay and we push them this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

195
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,969
we do today<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right but as we can all</font>

196
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,800
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's suboptimal what we want to do</font>

197
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:06,289
instead is stick all that into a

198
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,360
repository and analytic repository and

199
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:09,649
then share that with a community within

200
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,419
the context of the community what we

201
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:14,749
want to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the method itself the</font>

202
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,008
recipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> how good is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay coming your</font>

203
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:17,930
false positives coming your false

204
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,809
negatives I said false positives and

205
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,360
your true pauses positive to me tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

206
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:25,129
how expensive it was for you okay how do

207
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,830
you measure the cost how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you measure</font>

208
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,809
toxicity how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give</font>

209
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,248
you a recipe you want to know if you

210
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,349
have a gluten allergy you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

211
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:35,149
hey there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wooten in here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you</font>

212
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a peanut allergy I don't want to</font>

213
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:40,099
eat your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pets hi thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much so</font>

214
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,260
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we capture that toxicity within</font>

215
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,110
our respective environments I have many

216
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,720
more notes than you guys might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have so</font>

217
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,209
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looking at an N squared computation</font>

218
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,689
time or n log n all right some basic

219
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:54,619
ways for us to be able to calculate<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

220
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:56,870
the fourth thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to catch</font>

221
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,690
sure this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's more</font>

222
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,339
specific to my industry but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

223
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,589
know is there is there something

224
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:06,170
systemic going on with sufficient data

225
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,700
points I'll see perhaps maybe some sign

226
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,740
that somebody is<font color="#CCCCCC"> running a campaign</font>

227
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,430
against<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just me but a bunch of other</font>

228
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,500
things the fifth one is what's special

229
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,930
about you if you found evidence that

230
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone was trying but they failed is</font>

231
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,900
there something interesting about how

232
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,670
you design your system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe we</font>

233
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,069
should all learn from that's what we

234
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,449
want to be able to capture but just to

235
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,250
start off with the challenge for you

236
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,410
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> they asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I would make for</font>

237
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,740
you guys start capturing your analytic

238
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,660
methods in a way that we can reuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

239
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:38,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then tell us how good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was it and</font>

240
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,209
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us how costly it was all right then</font>

241
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,579
we offer to everyone else they consume

242
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,110
it we need to figure out a way to take

243
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,910
we get there a couple problems that we

244
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,100
have one is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take this this</font>

245
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,140
expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unique to us and</font>

246
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,910
genera<font color="#CCCCCC"> size it so that when it's</font>

247
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,380
received by somebody else they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

248
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,079
take that and then convert<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into their</font>

249
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,220
respective tooling okay that's our heart

250
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,500
that's a problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to all</font>

251
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,270
face but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that already we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

252
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,220
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we just don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a way</font>

253
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can easily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share with each other</font>

254
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,570
we don't we take our recipe where we

255
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,980
take our method for turning wheat in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

256
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,620
flour and think that's special to us

257
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,800
guess what we all have wheat and we all

258
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,750
have a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn it into flour okay</font>

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,630
they run it they get their own set of

260
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:24,440
indicators they shirt most of it doesn't

261
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:26,300
match most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> waste but the method</font>

262
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,770
itself is useful what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do is</font>

263
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,469
then show that and improve analytic

264
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,300
method tell us how<font color="#CCCCCC"> good it was how</font>

265
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,510
costly it was all the rest of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

266
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,599
makes sense ok so again the call to

267
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,040
action here for you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'm happy</font>

268
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,290
that you guys are sharing grandma's

269
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,449
version the rest of your really great

270
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,430
meal<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right but we can't really move</font>

271
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,279
the further art into science is about

272
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,650
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> this expression and turn it into</font>

273
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,200
something that what you want to do this

274
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,319
by what you already do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> within your</font>

275
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,140
shop okay how do we what's the format

276
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,450
for this how do we capture some of these

277
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,400
other data points that we need all right

278
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,970
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned there's examples</font>

279
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,720
already there's already examples and

280
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,329
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bianca</font>

281
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,199
those work there's examples that mitre

282
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:18,229
has they can be starting points but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

283
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:20,660
need to go further than that call to

295
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:52,279
instrumental in making this work for us

296
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,629
it's this is not theoretical this is

297
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,290
actually we're trying to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this work</font>

298
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:59,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">but we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are the</font>

299
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,449
people that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are the cooks all</font>

300
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,529
right and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want is more cooks we</font>

301
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually want more cooks in the kitchen</font>

302
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,439
believe it or not in here we want more

303
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,180
cooks in the kitchen<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we want to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to make this work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for all of us</font>

305
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:22,730
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the nature of this silly</font>

306
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:25,370
arrangement that we have this this this

307
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,870
community that we have up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

308
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,449
unfortunately a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

309
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,309
restricted one but i have no we have no

310
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:33,729
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are building this have no</font>

311
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:36,829
desire whatsoever to make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

312
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,610
construct of this a selective community

313
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:42,609
right so the content itself there's no

314
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,920
reason why the content can be stood up

315
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,449
by somebody else in fact in some ways we

316
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,240
kind of are already doing that we just

317
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:53,479
aren't telling certain people in golf

318
