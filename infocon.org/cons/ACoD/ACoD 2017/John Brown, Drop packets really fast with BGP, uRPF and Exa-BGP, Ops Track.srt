bits and pieces of things one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

wanted to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is source this</font>

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,750
packet filtering and some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do here in applying them</font>

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,790
caveat that I would throw out there is

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,619
before you implement something you

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,150
should always turn it up in a lab test

39
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,649
it make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what its</font>

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,119
implications are to your network a

41
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:50,130
little bit about me I mean based in

42
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,720
Albuquerque I will track travel for

43
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,869

45
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,740
course you never drink scotch less than

they're very easy to maintain especially

65
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,880
when you have hundreds of routers to

66
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,150
deploy this across not so there's got to

67

<font color="#CCCCCC">the ways that we do is we leverage BGP</font>

as a signaling protocol and we leverage

70
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,630
unicast reverse path forwarding as a

71
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,070
second way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of helping prevent and do</font>

72
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,160
things on our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll talk a</font>

73
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,290
little bit about each of these first

74
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,489
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about you r PF unicast</font>

75
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:22,700
reverse path warning so it's defined in

76
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,680
RFC 3704 that's the current RFC that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

77
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,709
found out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it talks about it there</font>

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,400
were a couple of previous rfcs but the

79
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,410
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is 3704 basically unicast</font>

80
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,989
reverse path forwarding is designed to

81
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,260
limit and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of source spoofed</font>

82
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:42,650
packets so the gentleman up here from

83
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,630
perimeter<font color="#E5E5E5"> X is sending me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a packet but</font>

84
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,910
it's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me with the source IP</font>

85
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:52,850
address that's not on his network then

86
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:55,040
he's potentially spoofing that packet ok

87
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,690
so what unicast reverse path forwarding

88
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,670
we'll do is we'll look at that packet

89
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,350
will look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and will look at</font>

90
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,768
our routing table<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

91
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,320

92
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:12,670

93
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:16,339
to him if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not drop if it is</font>

94
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:19,519
forward some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say you r PF is</font>

95
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,238
unicast reverse pass filtering it's not

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,509
filtering

97
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:27,739
240 is making a forwarding decision to

00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:29,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ford or not to forward in car and so</font>

99
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,660
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people out there that will say</font>

100
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,549
well we can't put you r PF I on our

101
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,020

implement into your network that will

126
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:43,430
actually do spoof checking and so we run

127
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,380
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool that they have a sister</font>

and once a day once a week whatever

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:52,490
their time period is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to spew</font>

boost packets out the door towards their

00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,448
blocking them and generally they don't

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,740
ever get past it's like the roach motel

134

they they never leave um I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">source so the attacker is leveraging the</font>

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,250
decision based on destination IP not

148
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,950
source you r PF lets us now look at that

149
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,260
source address we can look at it and do

150
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,030
things in two modes we can do something

151
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,370
in strict mode we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it in the loose</font>

152
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,960
mode strict mode says that if it

absolutely didn't come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

154
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:55,760
gentleman drop it if that's not

155
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:58,310
reachable back loose mode says well it's

156
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not directly down this interface but</font>

157
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,010
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a route in my routing table</font>

158
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,380
that says that source is a real source

159
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:10,310
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to still allow the traffic</font>

160
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,830
to flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok if the source is reachable</font>

161
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,470
than good else drop now here's an

malicious traffic flowing in towards

them all right one way he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,280

up and say hey would you please drop

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,320
but it's eating up the rest of my

189
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,710
you all get the point right it takes a

while for that to happen now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

hopefully the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his pipe is back</font>

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,010
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the bulk of his users are back up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy you pushed the problem</font>

206

upstream your victim is really now a

207
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,620
victim but it's sort of the lesser of

208
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:32,900
two evils right you've killed<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">protect the rest of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

use bgp to tell others whether their

peers or your transits to drop traffic

212
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,100
so now let's say your customers getting

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">d dot you can go through the black hole</font>

217
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,060
we can start to mix some of these

218
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,670
together if we enable strict mode you r

219
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,380
PF on your single home customers will

220
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,569
prevent source food packets from

221
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:07,670
entering the network this will help d

<font color="#CCCCCC">dos victims out there so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not making</font>

money on it when I enable you r PF on my

224
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,040
interfaces I'm helping new jeans network

225
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm helping that make sure that my</font>

226
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,120
network isn't causing a problem for

227
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,950
somebody else and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

228
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,800
mindset that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have with some service</font>

229
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,480
providers is is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really killing them</font>

230
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,420
so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they care and why do they need</font>

231
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push this across their network it's</font>

232
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:36,880
that their business is actually

233
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:40,280
impacting everybody else I talk a lot to

234
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,810
small rural ISPs and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have</font>

235
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,390
their backbone connections or over

236
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,420
microwave fixed wireless connections and

237
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:50,270
so they're spending money on time slots

238
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,760
to send that traffic down across their

239
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,400
wireless backbone so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help them</font>

240
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,890
figure out ways of fixing that upstream

241
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,449
that helps save them money it helps save

242
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,350
them

243
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:04,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">bandulus capabilities I will stress</font>

244
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,690
these points make sure that you test

245
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,930
these things in a lab before you start

246
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the party members but I can't just drop</font>

252
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,810
then your attacker realizes that you're

253
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,969
now blocking those so we'll go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

254
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:36,160
and spin up a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of IPs well</font>

255
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,370
we can do is we can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> your PF lose</font>

256
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,319
feature we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> inject a route into the</font>

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,200
fib with a forwarding information base

258
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,950
and we can set that route to be black

259
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,590
hole or null and now it happens is your

260
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,770
router will look at the source IP

261
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:57,190
address and we'll drop based on that

262
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:01,420
source IP because it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifth</font>

00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,620
of hardware we have a sequel database

that we put routes into we have a

what my presentation

338
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:27,940
is is all about last week we had a d das

369
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,410
stand for questions

370
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:57,660
we haven't gotten to millions but the

371
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,780
the core routers we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> or memory wise</font>

we we try it's never going to be perfect

none of this is perfect we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known services IP addresses in</font>

381
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,600
there has somebody's gone out and tried

00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:03,860
all that no we haven't seen that I'm

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let me call I what I was saying it</font>

make us money or cost us money stuff

389
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,529
like that basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was using that as</font>

on you r PF about two years ago we saw

about an eight percent drop in our

00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:55,570
overall traffic so from from our benefit

397
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,840
perspective I believe we're running

398

downstream ISPs are happier because

we're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bake neither youth bgp to</font>

401
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:07,509

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens and we can go</font>

Carl harm and if there's a literally a

425
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:51,780
12 line in search you can put on an edge

426
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:54,000
interface and you can get your junior

429
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,890
prevent that then you sort of get rid of

430
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,929
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem I mean the i guess the flip</font>

using medical as a as an example as to

433
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,010
the way we're thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying</font>

434
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,419
to solve some of these problems and hey

435
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,450
we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital so who</font>

because it's good drugs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and good</font>

440
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,770
and eating better so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

441
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,120
to go there I would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

allow traffic into your network that is

445
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:37,559
faith and we have the same problem in

446
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,129
the voice telephony world right we have

447
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:42,600
tons of spoofed caller ID and

448
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:45,770
origination phone numbers we've got to

449
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve that problem too</font>

450
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:57,879
mostly reactive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do get some data feeds</font>

451
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,889
from a few folks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I trust that i'll</font>

452
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,019
take those IPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they'll tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

455
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:08,018
throw them into our our system and drop

traffic well we're playing with their

457
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:12,309
real quick is we're now working on where

458
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:14,740
we can set next top to actually go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

that and an alarming we are doing that

476
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,639
right now purely on bit rate and then

477
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:43,500
also on packet rate because I consider

478
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:48,690
the two of them very separate indicators

479

historically we've been a cisco shop and

one of the things is i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

507
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,440
there's researchers that are in the

community here but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things we have</font>

509
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,340
done with a couple of folks is because
