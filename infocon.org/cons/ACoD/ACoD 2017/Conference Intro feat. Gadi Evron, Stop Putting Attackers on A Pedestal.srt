bar over to the stage to channel Joe

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,530
Stewart<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what we want to accomplish</font>

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,140
interpersonally from the conference and

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,420
then we're going to break into tracks

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,910
operations is going to be here

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,320
philosophy is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there</font>

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,660
today it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be mainly talk</font>

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,270
tomorrow philosophy track becomes about

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,029
the art into science bit where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,799
to start building<font color="#E5E5E5"> the methodologies</font>

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,689
repeatable models and all that other

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,280
cool stuff so a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the conference</font>

26
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,729
this came to be out of several<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,229
one of them was the general frustration

28
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,689
that security conferences put the

29
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,330
attacker or the hacker or Devon ability

30
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,059
or yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeep being hacked in as</font>

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,330
on a pedestal<font color="#CCCCCC"> or honestly I could care</font>

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,159
less if I wasn't the UK chippy I should

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,590
I don't care less right it changes the

34
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,950
meaning I don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much about yet</font>

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,700
another vulnerability and what I do care

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,430
about is defense as Mike said I want to

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,740
hear talks about what I do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear talks about the sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it was</font>

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,509
the first idea we've had closed

40
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,130
conferences in the past but it's time

41
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a community that's</font>

42
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:57,060
open talk share and enable more people

43
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,000
to get into this sets the fence

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,030
operational track the philosophy track

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,030
is more about being sick and tired of

46
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,740
the

47
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,110
security field made an art form sold in

48
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,340
science we believe it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

49
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,770
management strategy architecture to be

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,040
as rigorous and as respected as the

51
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,540
technical aspects and to try to make

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,179
repeatable implementations that we can

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,679
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> use learn from and grow it so in a</font>

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,630
positive way rather than sick and tired

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,690
of it we want to build security up is

56
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,090
more of discipline<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's what</font>

57
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:39,120
that's a lot of a track is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

58
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:43,140
way this is about building up security

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,970
to being more useful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us daily but</font>

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,660
it's also kind of two conferences in one

61
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's generally what it's about</font>

62
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,450
it's about as a quick recap thank you
