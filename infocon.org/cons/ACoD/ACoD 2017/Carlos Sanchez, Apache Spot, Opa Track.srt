00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,859
talk about a budget spot is an open

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,599
source project so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me start if you</font>

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:16,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or where you wanna</font>

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:19,770
interrupt me smell of a deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Who I am as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what for in</font>

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,810
tow I'm security researcher and working

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,340
set up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the group I'm not part of the</font>

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,929
Intel security<font color="#E5E5E5"> side so I need to do this</font>

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">because most of the times people think</font>

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:45,750
them so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda next generate</font>

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,399
next-generation security analytics we

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,440
will explain about apache spot

16
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,829
incubating<font color="#CCCCCC"> project that we are working</font>

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,870
in DC<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will show you a demo of the</font>

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,840
graphic user interface that we are

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:05,149
developed on the architecture behind a

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:12,720
bad spot our know our roadmap and the

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:16,320
question and answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> then so we have</font>

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,600
this billion of events each day in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,048
data centers right most of the time we

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,619
try to collect these particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> Laxus</font>

25
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,350
right from couple of sessions ago

26
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,720
mention we have trillions of events in

27
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,339
our data center right so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,439
manage that we start to thinking inside

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Intel and with another partners how</font>

30
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,639
can we do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we require a scale as you</font>

31
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,490
may see on the foil big data analytics

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,070
and also include much in learning in

33
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,009
order to detect that particular things

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,860
that are not visible for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense for</font>

35
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,049
the other tools that is well working

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,210
with signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

37
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,420
pretty much how a spot offers to you

38
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,419
guys

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:10,610
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the next generation security</font>

40
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:14,900
tool basically as you may see on the

41
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,750
fall sem manage terabytes per day while

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,620
correlating login and staging different

43
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,140
sources firewalls IPS this luxe whatever

44
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right most of the same have</font>

45
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,820
different connectors in order to well

46
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:33,459
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information you can</font>

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:36,140
analyze it basically but using big data

48
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,830
well gives you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next layer you can</font>

49
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,690
store petabytes where they ingest this

50
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,490
particular information in a cluster

51
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:49,160
using HDFS or another technology in

52
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,100
order to you can query this information

53
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:57,200
manipulate generate script to whatever

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,660
you want right so and that is pretty

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,119
much the philosophy behind a budget but

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,770
you can check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the way I think</font>

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll donate the code a couple of</font>

58
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,450
months ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Apache Incubator</font>

59
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,250
project in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

60
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,339
everybody can use this particular

61
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">project in order to ingest whatever</font>

62
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,890
information that you need I saw a couple

63
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,100
of talks yesterday that well basically

64
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need to store different layers of</font>

65
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,320
information correlate the information

66
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,450
there make mixes well basically do

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:35,798
whatever you want on top of the of

68
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:41,149
Apache top Apache spot so as I mentioned

69
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:43,100
this is a bad spot I will do a demo of

70
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:47,630
the GUI as I mentioned before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

71
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:53,359
running docker containers is<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font>

72
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:55,430
machine and I basically don't know the

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,739
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have available on the</font>

74
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,630
Apache<font color="#CCCCCC"> for project is a container videos</font>

75
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,520
don't let the container and you can see

76
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,519
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me move this</font>

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,520
sure

78
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,060
that means the

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,899
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

80
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,830
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a collusive interface that</font>

81
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apache spot will offer to you guys as</font>

82
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,930
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may see this is the result from one</font>

83
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:39,800
day ingesting net flows in our corporate

84
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,380
environment we ingest<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 billions of</font>

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,270
events each day and this is the results

86
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,700
that we obtained<font color="#E5E5E5"> using machine learning</font>

87
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,609
algorithms<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will describe this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> party</font>

88
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,880
later this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you how the</font>

89
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,860
buoy of a spot looks like basically on

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top we have something that we call</font>

91
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:04,300
suspicious results the species results

92
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:07,280
basically is the result of our lda

93
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,220
algorithms that analyze these stem

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,280
billions of events well this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

95
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,620
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one day of our natural</font>

96
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,289
infrastructure right<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

97
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,590
collect this information we send it to

98
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:24,050
the cluster we analyze it and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> present</font>

99
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:28,390
this to the customer right I will just

100
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:32,480
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of information that we</font>

101
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:35,360
basically fine and looks interesting for

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,630
us so while the IP address was changes

103
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,450
because we can share our internal subnet

104
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,040
but anyway this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the result assuming</font>

105
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,500
sig will have brung this is more

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,980
suspicious for the algorithm and we also

107
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,740
add information or context to this

108
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,440
particular network connection in order

109
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:58,460
to you can well go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this particular</font>

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,580
results and start to look in this kind

111
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,700
of connection right we are using your

112
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">localization in order to well display</font>

113
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,979
what what is the location<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

114
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,110
particular connection that is that you

115
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,440
are seeing inside of your network we

116
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,720
also use thread intelligent fit in this

117
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,170
case we are using the DI but you can use

118
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,140
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> bendel you have internally in</font>

119
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:27,110
order to add context right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday as</font>

120
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:32,200
i mentioned before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> listened that a</font>

121
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:36,350
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of guys need to do this kind of</font>

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,860
hunting right have results and add

123
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,750
context using differ

124
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,719
sources right that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the philosophy</font>

125
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,210
behind a budget but if you have a data

126
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,310
source and you want to add context and

127
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,948
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other data in different</font>

128
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,750
sources you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can mix experience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

129
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:55,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically use a machine learning</font>

130
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,300
algorithm in order to select the results

131
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are interesting for you network</font>

132
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,889
right so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

133
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:09,479
interface will we display the results

134
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:11,370
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we have also an</font>

135
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:15,270
Edgar view in order to you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

136
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,580
check what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the patterns inside of</font>

137
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,889
your network right is you see something

138
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is not normal in your organization</font>

139
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,050
you can just select it and go in deep

140
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,120
with to that particular communications

141
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,310
right so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if you consider</font>

142
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,129
well as you may see as soon as you a

143
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,800
little tip that particular information

144
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:38,370
if part will tell you the IP address if

145
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,069
you want to filter yeah you just click

146
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,529
and you can isolate that particular

147
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,960
information and display it over here if

148
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:48,360
you can check<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details of that</font>

149
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,770
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> net flow information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

150
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,469
do it is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal the other part</font>

151
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,190
of the of the product is something that

152
00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:02,159
we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> notebooks the nach booth</font>

153
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:05,310
basically is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python code that you can</font>

154
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:08,789
use in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to query delete the data in</font>

155
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:13,849
this case we modify the bill because

156
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:17,969
most of our customers or most of our

157
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:19,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys from the community our guys that</font>

158
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:24,389
are interested on security not too much

159
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:26,879
on and develop a Python script so if you

160
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,800
are at data scientist you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font>

161
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,169
code is in order to you can query the

162
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,519
data that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on the cluster right</font>

163
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:37,799
and do different analysis let me go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

164
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,620
and basically the important part

165
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">earrings that that particular results</font>

166
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,459
that budget for generates you can

167
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:49,449
basically score it and give these

168
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,640
particular feedback to the

169
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:55,450
machine learning in order to the next

170
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,670
day they don't show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you these particular</font>

171
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,040
results again if you escort this as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

172
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,780
this means that this is not important

173
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,620
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization so the next day</font>

174
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,240
the machine learning just will avoid

175
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,380
that particular results and will except

176
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,470
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> for show you interesting stuff like</font>

177
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:17,980
stuff that is laying here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also if</font>

178
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:21,580
you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate thread</font>

179
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,470
counting or well indicate that this is

180
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,300
maybe an attacking side of the

181
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,820
organization you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> write this</font>

182
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:31,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular connection as a one is call</font>

183
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:35,200
it and basically the model of trade

184
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:39,040
intelligence of Apache pod will generate

185
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:43,870
this information and we win we want to

186
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,880
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you this particular rating in</font>

187
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,910
a word from map we will share this

188
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,880
information with other sources in order

189
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:55,689
to you can react properly so basically

190
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our main use case collect net</font>

191
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">flow and represent this information from</font>

192
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,690
our week however<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as we start to</font>

193
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,260
develop this we some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the guys out</font>

194
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,510
there tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be really</font>

195
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:16,510
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we can ingest different</font>

196
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:20,080
sources so we start to develop another

197
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:23,770
use cases like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS basically is the</font>

198
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,440
same philosophy just using another data

199
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,199
source in these cases as I already

200
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,230
mentioned DNS you can do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same cell</font>

201
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,110
right as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> ekalaka your millions</font>

202
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,470
or billions of DNS labs on the clutter

203
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the machine learning algorithm will just</font>

204
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:46,210
display you the 220 suspicious connects

205
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:51,100
for dns and you can start the hunting

206
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:52,900
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> field as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may see is the similar</font>

207
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,700
approach just with a different data

208
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:59,600
source like

209
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:05,150
like you can also write a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns connection</font>

210
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:07,630
and start to catching<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS common</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

211
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and controls over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Nell's</font>

212
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:14,480
different attacks that you can discover

213
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:16,939
and well also the bad guys can use in

214
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to exfiltrate information using</font>

215
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:23,900
this particular protocol our next use

216
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,840
case that we are developing we are

217
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:31,819
finishing right now is practice we are

218
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">ingesting proxy locks in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache spot</font>

219
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:39,860
platform in order to do similar stuff as

220
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:42,950
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent and DNS life so this is</font>

221
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:46,430
pretty much the graphical user interface

222
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:49,340
of a budget<font color="#CCCCCC"> pot you can use it and play</font>

223
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,680
with it we could this is a docker

224
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:55,220
container you just pull it and see the

225
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:04,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">information right but let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> return to</font>

226
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:06,500
the earth to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presentation so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

227
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,359
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty much architect to that we are</font>

228
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,560
managing behind the scenes on a budget

229
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,240
spot as you may see we have that sausage

230
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,410
different that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are focused</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a budget</font>

231
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:23,270
pot we have net flow that comes from

232
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:26,089
routers and switches we have dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

233
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:31,069
of this locks comes from comes from bra

234
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:36,200
and a couple of blocks for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns comes</font>

235
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:40,390
from windows also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we basically have</font>

236
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,390
collectors these particular collectors

237
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,220
and check

238
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay these particular collectors</font>

239
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:56,790
basically are demons running in Linux

240
00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:02,489
that injures the information to wear a

241
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:05,550
file system in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case in its HDFS we</font>

242
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,850
are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cloudera are in order to</font>

243
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:11,310
basically polish this information and

244
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,380
after data right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are using this</font>

245
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,810
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze all these</font>

247
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i show you previously right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

248
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,290
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much information the the</font>

249
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,190
architecture behind the scenes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

250
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:28,230
also are using the GUI that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font>

251
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,470
describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes ago and</font>

252
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:36,570
this is based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudera but you can</font>

253
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:39,860
use Hadoop or whatever other technology

254
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:43,320
that you want map map<font color="#E5E5E5"> are or any other</font>

255
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:46,910
technology that supports hgss you can

256
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,770
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it basically we are just developing</font>

257
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,850
obviously the collectors how can we

258
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:56,550
process the data stories just hgss and

259
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,160
we are using back right previously we

260
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,469
are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> MPI's in order to analyze and</font>

261
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,540
generate the suspicious results<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

262
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:07,050
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the code is just in this</font>

263
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,560
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> first and well we have on the road</font>

264
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,150
map another integration with different

265
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Intel security products we will show you</font>

266
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:19,290
this in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of weeks and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

267
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,770
premature this is the architecture

268
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,900
behind the scenes for the Apache spot

269
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:29,910
projects as I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are using</font>

270
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to detect species the</font>

271
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,100
deck and generate these two species

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">connect</font>

273
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:41,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is another part of the</font>

274
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,680
architecture of a party spot as you may

275
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:47,019
see we can collect information from the

276
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,689
CM also if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

277
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,779
ingest this particular information on a

278
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:54,269
project what you can do it we have a

279
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:57,749
three connectors right now but we are

280
00:14:54,269 --> 00:15:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">working in order to develop another</font>

281
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:05,050
connectors like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jimmy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see you down</font>

282
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,720
another use cases that we want to

283
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:11,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">develop this standpoint give more user</font>

284
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,610
context this means that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to well</font>

285
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,649
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to whatever authentication</font>

286
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,720
source that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and basic Kali's</font>

287
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">write this information in order to as</font>

288
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,089
soon as you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the suspicious results</font>

289
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,839
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may know which machine is doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

290
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:30,970
particular traffic on which user is

291
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:37,029
logging in that particular machine like

292
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:40,089
so we are having<font color="#E5E5E5"> also another initiative</font>

00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:43,000
there is another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and that it's a</font>

294
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:47,740
very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this one open data</font>

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">models open data models would be huge</font>

296
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,149

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:58,000
whatever you want no<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter if is a use</font>

case from DNS proxy IPS firewall raw

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,540
data whatever you can basically write

300
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:07,269
the information there and add context on

301
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,660
top of this particular flow data in

302
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:13,420
order to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache spot we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font>

303
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">more information as you as soon as you</font>

304
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:21,069
have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the graphical user interface</font>

305
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:24,429
well what a couple of hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago well</font>

306
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:27,009
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guide from a talaxian</font>

307
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:30,699
mentioned that they are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> kappa on</font>

308
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:33,850
amazon we are also trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

309
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:36,219
order to ingest faster the information

310
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:40,339
that we are collecting on the closer so

311
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:43,100
that would be our next step use kappa

312
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:46,249
stream such things in order to write

313
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:51,319
faster and replicate information in the

314
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:53,800
HDFS<font color="#CCCCCC"> side and for whatever other source</font>

315
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,509
that they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we needed right</font>

316
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:00,859
and as I mentioned before right now

317
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:06,289
these parties already working we change

318
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:11,000
the machine learning code to run on back

319
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:13,819
and this give us more more response time

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,809
before we are taking like an eight hours

321
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:19,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">in order to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze 1,000,000,000 not</font>

322
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten billions of students right now we</font>

323
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,919
are taking just three hours in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

324
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:27,589
analyze them billions of event this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

325
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:31,370
net flow this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mud flow we are</font>

326
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:34,399
analyzing another kind of sources like

327
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,860
dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and proxy but we need to measure how</font>

328
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:39,918
many times we will consume in order to

329
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:45,320
generate this species result<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is</font>

330
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:49,190
a current effort so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how a budget</font>

331
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:52,340
for the leaders to you as i mention data

332
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:57,020
and analytics platform open data model

333
00:17:52,340 --> 00:18:00,678
we will show this particular to project

334
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,389
in a couple of weeks in RSA so if you

335
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,029
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contribute to the open data</font>

336
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,669
model you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are welcome because we</font>

337
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:11,649
need a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of expertise on the flip side</font>

338
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:14,360
so I I see that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of ideas</font>

339
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:16,100
related with this and if you want to

340
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,039
contribute this is an open source

341
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:24,610
project based on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache foundations</font>

342
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:31,129
of your work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth then you go back</font>

343
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:34,370
so what and in this case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very</font>

344
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,590
tied to the cybersecurity use cases so

345
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,809
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> with hunting incident detection and</font>

346
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,539
resolution a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

347
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:44,240
previously mentioned in other features

348
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:46,309
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also or in face-to-face meetings</font>

349
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have yesterday with some of you</font>

350
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:51,799
guys we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> offering this to you however</font>

351
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,740
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have another use cases in the</font>

352
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,230
financial institutions also and medical

353
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,100
institutions that they are not using a

354
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:04,850
spotter cyber security tool that you are

355
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,340
using a spot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Detective Rosen</font>

356
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:11,899
things that are not common instead of

357
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:17,658
the day organization so we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

358
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:19,549
trying to not share the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache food idea</font>

359
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:23,230
with you for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity side</font>

360
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:27,039
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use these particular</font>

361
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:33,529
tools in other use cases not not tied to

362
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity so this is a our roadmap</font>

363
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:38,570
and the idea that we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

364
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,880
mind also<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want to see another</font>

365
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:44,389
kind of information on a patch it

366
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:48,020
forward you need another few tools on

367
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:50,149
the tool you can send us emails and we

368
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:54,760
can prioritize these because this is a

369
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:58,120
not right now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a project of the</font>

370
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:02,020
Apache Apache community right so if you

371
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:05,750
subscribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the community you can send</font>

372
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:10,010
ideas or<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests and changement in</font>

373
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:13,669
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to oh well basically and hence the</font>

374
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:16,570
product so and on the top you will see

375
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:19,250
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can read that we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enhance</font>

376
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,460
the machine learning algorithms

377
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:25,220
basically 0 which cali right now we are

378
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,730
using just one lda in order to detect

379
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:31,340
but we we know that just one algorithms

380
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,549
will not detect everything so we are

381
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,639
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enhance that particular pillar</font>

382
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:40,020
on the

383
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:44,330
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other brother the second one is</font>

384
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:46,889
as a you're already see we need more

385
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,050
Marco lactose in order to ingest

386
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,910
different data in the Apache spot and

387
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:54,230
correlate these particular information

388
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:57,960
instead of the product in order to

389
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:02,160
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> the incident response faith to</font>

390
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,380
our community we have also what we

391
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">require some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the our customers</font>

392
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,910
requires root cause analysis that

393
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:15,090
involves that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work and</font>

394
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:17,550
integrate with another with other view /

395
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,340
tools in order to do forensic analysis

396
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:23,940
collector locks from sources that we are

397
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:27,570
not collecting right now so we are

398
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:31,350
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that also as you may see on</font>

399
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:33,750
the site whether scope of analysis means

400
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:37,620
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to integrate more and more</font>

401
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:42,360
data no<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter if is structural onyx</font>

402
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:46,709
structures so we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> working in order to</font>

403
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:49,020
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to you guys and as I</font>

404
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,760
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the other huge topic</font>

405
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,639
that we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open data</font>

406
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:58,500
model we are at creating this particular

407
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:02,190
model in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work basically have</font>

408
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,840
give a robust platform in order to you

409
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,670
can collect whatever information you

410
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,189
want and correlate the information

411
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,580
inside of Apache use you the idea is

412
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:14,250
that you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to other</font>

413
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:19,080
sources in order to find that particular

414
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:21,780
information and well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> premature</font>

415
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,530
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved without</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as you may see we</font>

416
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:27,420
have different areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project of</font>

417
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:32,250
collectors machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning we have also</font>

418
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:35,010
the graphical user interface and well

419
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:40,050
they develop of the open data model if

420
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to work share with without your</font>

421
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:46,200
knowledge develop or give us ideas you

422
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,700
can contact us you can go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> slab</font>

423
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,690
channel

424
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:55,220
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> widows and that is pretty much all</font>

425
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:58,620
guys I don't know if you have questions

426
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,769
this is a couple of guys that are

427
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:04,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on these particular projects</font>

428
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:09,090
gaps I projects in 25 very clavicle or

429
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:14,250
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cloudera and what if you want</font>

430
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:21,470
to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a participatory</font>

431
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:21,470
your contacts so questions

432
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,000
chip

433
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,900
right

434
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,779
well they're fierce I say two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

435
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,809
have start just to train the algorithm

436
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:03,729
just say into the machine learning

437
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,918
algorithms that this is not important

438
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:08,710
for for me and you'll save it right

439
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,200
after this particular two weeks I start

440
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,960
to see this kind of information where I

441
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,779
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> and detect things that are not</font>

442
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,700
common in my organization so I just need

443
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to train a couple of days the algorithm</font>

444
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,159
in order to start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing results</font>

445
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,249
right I see results from the few days

446
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:32,259
but maybe most of the results will be

447
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:35,320
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me remove the filter food will be</font>

448
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:38,799
not available right but after<font color="#CCCCCC"> two weeks</font>

449
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,629
I will see a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool suspicious</font>

450
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,379
results in order to start the hunting

451
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:46,449
life so it's very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> because well as</font>

452
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:49,269
you already mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 billions of</font>

453
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,429
events per day is not is not feasible

454
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:55,149
right to analyze<font color="#CCCCCC"> and well basically</font>

455
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:57,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">gooiest we train the other in just a</font>

456
00:24:55,149 --> 00:25:00,008
couple of days one week two weeks and

457
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:04,979
after that we start seeing this kind of

458
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:04,979
results where we can start to hunt yep

459
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,309
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry</font>

460
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:21,840
anything else right now know that is why

461
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,240
we are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to engage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the community in</font>

462
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,689
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that data scientist that</font>

463
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,870
can give us more Marines or ideas around

464
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,120
which algorithms we can use in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

465
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:43,739
detect more and more right because right

466
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:46,949
now we are using just one well the code

467
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,620
is already on the underneath<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

468
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:55,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apaches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two projects you can check their</font>

469
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:57,780
the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> LVL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

470
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,550
basically in the back right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

471
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:03,810
remember correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can execute it</font>

472
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:06,090
over your data and that is pretty much

473
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,250
all so if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to contribute or</font>

474
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:11,520
modify something<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over more things</font>

475
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:13,290
you can work basically go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flap</font>

476
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,129
channel be a committed on the project

477
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:21,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you yeah let me</font>

478
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:27,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">show let me go there is black dot Apache</font>

479
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,500
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can talk</font>

480
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:38,210
so I'm to help

481
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:43,920
nope thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
