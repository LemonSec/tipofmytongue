1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,429
time it also freely on going to talk

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,950
about a social<font color="#CCCCCC"> login I'll go in a little</font>

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,570
bit about what specifically I'm going to

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,378
talk about within<font color="#E5E5E5"> social again and how</font>

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,180
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it more practical so just a</font>

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit about Who I am on the</font>

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,189
boundaries video of perimeter<font color="#E5E5E5"> X we're</font>

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,050
doing a behavioral based web protection

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,660
so we're protecting websites from

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,279
automated attacks and a lot of the

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,489
factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'll talk about from social</font>

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,489
again is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the benefits or the</font>

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:40,410
perceived benefits or the risks when you

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,959
as this site or an application are

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:47,370
utilizing some third-party login or

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,670
social again so what what I'm not going

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,828
to cover in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font>

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,410
the conference i'm not talking talk

19
00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:00,270
about potential vulnerabilities and

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,640
threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to an open ID</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,470
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the risk of putting all</font>

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,659
your eggs in one basket and what happens

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,450
if you crack into that basket or if you

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,060
manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that or something like the</font>

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,010
yahoo leak and the potential for<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:20,189
people were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using they already so i'm</font>

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to cover that so how it all</font>

28
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,508
started a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of motivation and</font>

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,369
why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should care about it and how we</font>

30
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,170
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it at perimeter act</font>

31
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,960
so last year one of our customers who

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,229
would protect against all kind of type

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,658
of brute force attack call us one day

34
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,210
and with showing this graph basically

35
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,210
showing now what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph should show</font>

36
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,380
is obviously the spike of account being

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,149
created where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the average of</font>

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,210
accounts being created on the system

39
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,420
used to be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred and suddenly</font>

40
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,339
spiked to around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 900</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and kept their very</font>

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,890
steady they're saying it's obviously

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,079
automated you're protecting our login

43
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,489
how come you're not detecting it what's

44
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:12,150
what's going on here well looking into

45
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,700
that what we found out that when you

46
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,750
look at their login page

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,730
there are two routes one for a bot

48
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,890
trying once they start enabling us

49
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,399
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through the regular account</font>

50
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:28,399
creation user password<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay creating it</font>

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,739
we're deployed there on that path and

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,830
and it failed but when social again was

53
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:39,560
used basically the underlying assumption

54
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,599
is that Google and Facebook will know to

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,330
verify that you're human<font color="#E5E5E5"> they won't let</font>

56
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">you create an account if you or not so</font>

57
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,840
no point on deploying any mechanism on

58
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:54,440
any protection on that route which was

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,670
obviously wrong and and led to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

60
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,590
account created using vulnerabilities or

61
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:05,119
potential vulnerabilities and attacks

62
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:08,329
using social login credentials<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go</font>

63
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,340
into more<font color="#E5E5E5"> details and this brought us to</font>

64
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:12,349
figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the risk there how</font>

65
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,140
should you in deploy or how should you

66
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:18,170
utilize<font color="#CCCCCC"> write a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> social again when you</font>

67
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">are building an application some other</font>

68
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,480
potential I mean once you do that what's

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,579
the risk with doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again it</font>

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,700
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to deploy a botnet or to</font>

71
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:30,380
distribute malware basically if in many

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,450
cases basically what can you do what

73
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> permissions can you do on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

74
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:39,190
application once you logged in if it's

75
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:42,230
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dropbox or box having a</font>

76
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,639
file sharing if you use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> social login</font>

77
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,350
credentials to do that you can

78
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,040
potentially distribute malware in a very

79
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,540
hard to trace way because it's every

80
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,578
user will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have their own malware</font>

81
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,880
distribution a very efficient

82
00:03:52,579 --> 00:04:01,329
distribution way we've seen cases where

83
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:05,150
people's account would be hacked through

84
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:07,400
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook or other social profiles</font>

85
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,450
and create profiles on dating sites and

86
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">their botnets will basically collect</font>

87
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,048
attribution from the dating sites or

88
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:17,329
other side for people registering now

89
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:18,978
obviously using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook or something</font>

90
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this I can create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very reliable</font>

91
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:23,030
profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the name I have photos I</font>

92
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">have friends I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really create a</font>

93
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,469
highly reliable profile not good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

94
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I know I</font>

95
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,080
wouldn't want my profile to be on a

96
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Russian dating site and also not good</font>

97
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,200
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dating site who is paying for</font>

98
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,240
not real users obviously when talking

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,909
about enterprise I know in our company

100
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,530
and many other companies using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a google</font>

101
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,440
login for instance as a single sign-on

102
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,960
for your enterprise applications

103
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,830
compromising that again big risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

104
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sidetracks on the</font>

105
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,450
interesting methods they utilize in the

106
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,640
button it but again this is more about

107
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,580
like how how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and what</font>

108
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,820
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so happy to talk about it</font>

109
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,800
later so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a step back and why</font>

110
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,170
do people utilize social again so for

111
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,330
the users it's very very helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

112
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,000
much easier mechanism I control one

113
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,770
place that I trust and use it to log

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,900
into everywhere else in a trustworthy

115
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:25,880
way I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage passwords and</font>

116
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,599
I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I can trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google with all</font>

117
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,550
my credentials and identities every site

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,230
again it's much better conversion easier

119
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,940
conversion I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go around</font>

120
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:39,500
that a simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight registration and it</font>

121
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,750
feels that is more security I mean I

122
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't need to manage passwords and users</font>

123
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,020
and all that I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to soil the</font>

124
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,900
Exponential's and and conversions are

125
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,849
much higher so for the user experience

126
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the product guys it's a much easier</font>

127
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:59,570
way to get users so let's start

128
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,360
challenging that and this is where where

129
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,990
things are turning on to be interesting

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,479
so we took here a site and basically

131
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,970
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use it either to</font>

132
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,180
create a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> account if you're one to</font>

133
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,810
help a user register or if you already

134
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,550
have an account to just easier easier to

135
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,220
sign means and let's challenge these two

136
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,280
options and and verify what exactly do

137
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,550
you get and what you don't so in many

138
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases you get a trust by proxy if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

139
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:34,640
a vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Facebook Twitter all</font>

140
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:38,599
these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they you have the you</font>

141
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,880
tap into a huge user base they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

142
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,830
self-approval also on the user

143
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,260
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> its actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials you're</font>

144
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,849
you're talking to a real user you know

145
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,510
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> email will probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

146
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:55,970
bounce back so very good you got that

147
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:57,740
from it but typically when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> login if</font>

148
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,050
you opt for that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the default</font>

149
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,360
you're basically logged in for 30 days

150
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,090
you all need to the user will not need

151
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,230
to introduce a password will not need

152
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,880
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there is a two-factor</font>

153
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,910
authentication you won't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to factor</font>

154
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,610
it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that device which means that</font>

155
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:17,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that point on if i'm already logged</font>

156
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,490
in and when when i'm using that

157
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,100
mechanism of google or facebook or any

158
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,530
kind of social again on my site and the

159
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,840
user is logging in I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

160
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,880
actually used the password or it's not

161
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,919
some hour or someone abusing this

162
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,830
session and using an open session I

163
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,020
don't know if it's someone I can trust I

164
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,930
know it's legitimate credentials but I

165
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,780
don't know much more than that so this

166
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,720
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one risk and one thing one one path</font>

167
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,539
that we saw that many cases are over met

168
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,540
in many places users are overlooking it

169
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,990
the other part<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you would assume is</font>

170
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,910
more strict is they create new<font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

171
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,490
basically when you click that usually

172
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,150
you'll have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> popup message showing</font>

173
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,820
something so in order to elaborate on on

174
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,409
on the risks and and they're figuring

175
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,760
out exactly what you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

176
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors we ran I won't do the demo but</font>

177
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:19,730
basically I build a to Chrome extensions

178
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:22,790
one to work around facebook login one to

179
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:26,930
work around Google again and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I created a</font>

180
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:29,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">mock up website that basically trust</font>

181
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,060
that to create an account what this

182
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,909
extension will do is again this is for

183
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:38,718
facebook once the user is logged into

184
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:40,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook and the reason you need to do</font>

185
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,080
that is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook will validate that</font>

186
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:48,080
the token exchange on on OS is coming

187
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,990
from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook origin so the request</font>

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,270
the xhr<font color="#CCCCCC"> request or whatever of that I</font>

189
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,680
want to approve this this application

190
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,850
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from</font>

191
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook second from a Facebook window</font>

192
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,589
so the extension will quietly wait until

193
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:06,620
the user will visit facebook and once

194
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:09,140
it's there it will basically send a get

195
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,450
access throughout from facebook which

196
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,699
will typically result in that but when

197
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,790
you're doing it you can do just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the xhr</font>

198
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,310
you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to display the image the</font>

199
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,649
users actually does not see anything so

200
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,689
everything is just an xhr request a you

201
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,330
get you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a request you get the data</font>

202
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,820
from the data actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you process the</font>

203
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,820
user parameter and you structure a post

204
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,800
request to grant access to your app you

205
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,890
know in advance<font color="#CCCCCC"> what up the ID of the</font>

206
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,390
app on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on the store and by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

207
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook basically granted you</font>

208
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,050
access so without once the user is

209
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,330
logged in the extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing</font>

210
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,149
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the background create an</font>

211
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,339
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that third party application</font>

212
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:51,620
and again the application didn't see

213
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything the application basically did</font>

214
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,899
not verify a proof did not see a request

215
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,760
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user but the next time the user</font>

216
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,300
will go into the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font>

217
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,370
say create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an account will just a login</font>

218
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,859
and application will work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook</font>

219
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,100
and say okay is this user verified this

220
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,930
user approve my application<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access to</font>

221
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,700
facebook facebook will say yes they will

222
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:18,380
be happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and you can work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on so</font>

223
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,640
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i can automatically for</font>

224
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,200
instance assuming it would be an

225
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,699
application like a dropbox and they

226
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,339
won't have any additional security

227
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,709
measures<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can without it using knowing</font>

228
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:29,510
create an account using the Facebook

229
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,569
credentials upload something and do

230
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:35,770
something on it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google it's very</font>

231
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:40,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">similar I'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the access see that</font>

232
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,270
with google and you may have multiple

233
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,380
accounts so if you have multiple

234
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,600
accounts on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that part you need to</font>

235
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,510
click a button now with google unlike

236
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,990
Facebook they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need to show</font>

237
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,189
it in a in a tab tab could be hidden<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

238
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,020
could it doesn't need to be in the

239
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,360
foreground so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just open the tab</font>

240
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,550
in the black<font color="#CCCCCC"> background and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ours will do</font>

241
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,529
that you can simulate the click you can

242
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,779
just say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'll click the first user</font>

243
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">i click i approve this this application</font>

244
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,920
nover no verification that the user

245
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,830
actually seeing it or actually giving

246
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,649
access you get the access same story all

247
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:18,620
over again so when talking about

248
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,880
creating an account which<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't expected</font>

249
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,310
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a much more interactive where a</font>

250
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,779
user actually grunt access even<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

251
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:28,849
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really get even there you</font>

252
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:31,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I mean the only</font>

253
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,740
validation of a human in this process is

254
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere between the time where the</font>

255
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,690
internet was invented and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time where</font>

256
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,520
I asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this grand somewhere there</font>

257
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,160
the user created an account on google or

258
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,810
in facebook they did validate that they

259
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,490
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a text message they will</font>

260
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,160
evaluate<font color="#E5E5E5"> your email great they will do</font>

261
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,810
all that but after doing that no

262
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,360
validation is done so even when you

263
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,819
create an account you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get any</font>

264
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,459
actual approval from them except the

265
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,070
fact that it's an actual user that it's

266
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:04,270
an actual account not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an actual user so</font>

267
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:07,610
so I think take away from our phone was

268
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,410
knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's very important to</font>

269
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,850
understand what social login does not

270
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,140
give you it does give you the ease of

271
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,020
use it does give you the use of

272
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,760
registration getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some validated</font>

273
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,339
credentials but it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that</font>

274
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,770
the user voluntarily wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

275
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,810
does not mean that the person doing that

276
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,540
is actually a human it might be an

277
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,859
automated script or button it as we saw

278
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:35,000
a list of button<font color="#E5E5E5"> I often of browser</font>

279
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:39,670
extensions so it does not protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,990
site it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not protect the user and</font>

281
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,760
basically when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you create an account on</font>

282
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,680
your side does not mean that there was

283
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,959
any human verification it's not the

284
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,489
social account creation it's just for

285
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:56,359
the social login it just a login now is

286
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:59,300
it a vulnerability or not do we can we

287
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,640
expect the social login vendor to be

288
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,609
more responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did contact</font>

289
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook I did contact asking them about</font>

290
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,920
like hey I managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create an account</font>

291
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:12,230
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user being notified without</font>

292
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,089
any validation on your behalf on doing

293
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,980
that basically they're saying no<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's if</font>

294
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,230
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a malware you only can do that from</font>

295
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,209
within the browser basically it's a

296
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,050
chrome if you chrome should protect you

297
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:23,268
from

298
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,579
extension basically send an email to

299
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,959
chrome open the ticket<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're on is it</font>

300
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,899
a vulnerability is it something that you

301
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,018
you're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to now this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

302
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:35,060
funny thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because on one side this</font>

303
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:37,850
functionality is allowed in an extension

304
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,130
to do send xhr and do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it's</font>

305
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,529
also against the chrome web store policy

306
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,720
so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loud or not basically</font>

307
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,089
pointing finger everyone is saying that

308
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's someone's else's response to do</font>

309
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,380
that basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving the response on</font>

310
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,269
the website when talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google again</font>

311
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,579
and Google from again it was even more

312
00:13:53,269 --> 00:14:01,250
confusing because neither of them took

313
00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:03,109
responsibility and and it's it's just

314
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and the fact is there are a lot of</font>

315
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,709
chrome extensions and other browser

316
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,180
extensions that are just utilizing that

317
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:11,239
mechanisms and doing these kind of

318
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:15,410
things open so to recap what what we've

319
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,810
seen is that again social login is great

320
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,430
for the thing that it is providing for

321
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,050
mostly for ease of use and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font>

322
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,540
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should consider that it can also</font>

323
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide additional benefits again with</font>

324
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,170
Google you get two factor authentication

325
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:29,109
and things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but you need to be</font>

326
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">very cautious about what you don't get</font>

327
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,779
it does not secure the user it does not

328
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,329
secure the site and it's only says that

329
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:41,390
the credentials are right so what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

330
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:45,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">do how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can we manage that how can we</font>

331
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:47,750
help protect us so one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

332
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:51,620
especially in the forum like here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

333
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,720
and in groups we can try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and potentially</font>

334
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:58,070
demand the social again vendors to be

335
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,350
more responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to provide more</font>

336
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:03,529
capabilities for me as someone who is

337
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,660
utilizing that to verify that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

338
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,670
enabling an application it's not just

339
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,589
popping a window where someone can

340
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,839
automate the click in a hidden window or

341
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:13,760
just send a message even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

342
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,920
protocol also things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

343
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,680
allow that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be more</font>

344
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,670
responsible and do the validation and we

345
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,649
know that they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

346
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,689
validations because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you</font>

347
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,390
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your admin account on a</font>

348
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,860
Google application they will insist for

349
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,600
the two-factor authentication and they

350
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,699
will insist<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you to type in the</font>

351
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,260
password and they will insist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and verify</font>

352
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:34,819
that the user is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

353
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,139
they know to track the mouse

354
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:38,419
movement that you're not doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the</font>

355
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:39,979
background so they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the tools to</font>

356
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:42,199
do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not necessarily</font>

357
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:44,809
exposing it so for me as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

358
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:47,209
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to say i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to verify that</font>

359
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:50,988
the user actually approved that or for

360
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:53,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">me as a user explaining i mean or and if</font>

361
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:56,509
i'm managing my policy as an enterprise

362
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:59,419
using google as social again as a single

363
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:02,779
sign-on i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn this policy on</font>

364
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:05,600
that basically forces the user or<font color="#E5E5E5"> google</font>

365
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:09,529
to validate that a user and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

366
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,209
actually approved that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think this</font>

367
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a great thing to do currently they</font>

368
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:17,748
don't see that as part of the

369
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:19,999
responsibility so until they'll do that

370
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:23,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">or until we can get them to do that then</font>

371
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:24,619
what can we actually do so some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

372
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:28,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">recommendation some of the things that</font>

373
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:30,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our own and and helping</font>

374
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:33,619
our customers and and and everyone we're

375
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:34,999
talking to is basically so you should

376
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,829
use credential strictly asleep

377
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:41,209
credentials when you create an account

378
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:47,209
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to user logs in do enforce that</font>

379
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:49,549
the same type of controls logic and and

380
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:51,439
protection that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do when the</font>

381
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:54,379
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually just logging in when</font>

382
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:56,809
the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> is creating an account using a</font>

383
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,549
user<font color="#CCCCCC"> and password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so again you don't</font>

384
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:00,350
need necessarily to validate the email

385
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:04,878
but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify lights user</font>

386
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:07,309
you may want to restrict some some

387
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:09,049
actions so for instance you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

388
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:11,259
limit the amount of actions you can do

389
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:14,599
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're dichondra was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

390
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:16,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can show a CAPTCHA you can do things</font>

391
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help you validate that it's</font>

392
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the other thing is</font>

393
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:24,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">again tracking log in and sign up rates</font>

394
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,419
from that if you this is I mean

395
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:29,000
regardless for that I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

396
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:31,070
practice in general have your anomalies

397
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,799
if you suddenly see that something is

398
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,689
spiking from one type of things a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

399
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,700
the count being created a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

400
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,669
account being abused again<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a</font>

401
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,500
side track of all that and most sites if

402
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,419
you have if you created a user using a

403
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,419
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password and with the same</font>

404
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Emily you can use Google to log in</font>

405
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">NEMA on someone somehow I got that then</font>

408
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,720
basically should I is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same user</font>

409
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,120
or not most site<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just treat it as</font>

410
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same so the fact that I have the</font>

411
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,899
password in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system but I can log in</font>

412
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook Google and maybe other</font>

413
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,190
on the same email this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a potential</font>

414
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,290
risk but this these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can</font>

415
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,580
look about I mean is someone using one

416
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:17,030
method or the other some of the things

417
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:20,750
that helped also in cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

418
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,070
seen looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the origin sometimes</font>

419
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,450
again if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were doing it through an</font>

420
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,010
extension or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like this you</font>

421
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,800
will see that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin of the request</font>

422
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,890
or the refer<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be something that is is</font>

423
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,690
not the typical route of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> login</font>

424
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,360
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> page you won't</font>

425
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,370
expect the the login<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

426
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,290
different domain or for someone doing

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,419
something directly there it's available

428
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:44,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access log and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk or</font>

whatever method you are using especially

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">on sensitive sensitive reactions like</font>

431
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">login and account creation it's very</font>

432
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to verify is the referrer is</font>

433
00:18:51,800 --> 00:19:00,169
the origin of their request something

434
00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:03,559
that that makes sense again forms

435
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,420
loading in within iframes this is

436
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,428
another trick that was that we've seen

437
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,640
done again because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sourcing</font>

438
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:13,100
facebook because in many cases using

439
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,690
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> csrs tokens and things like</font>

440
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to verify that the user is actually</font>

441
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,650
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through your side and not using</font>

442
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,440
this mechanism to create an account

443
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:26,179
without actually visiting your site part

444
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:30,080
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this risks are extremely dangerous so</font>

445
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:33,140
so you can do that you can do basic

446
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,350
things on your side like x-ray<font color="#CCCCCC"> x frame</font>

447
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:39,280
options so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you won't allow your login</font>

448
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,169
page to be an iframe in another site

449
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,670
compare the top object to self object in

450
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,309
JavaScript to verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are running</font>

451
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,750
within an iframe or things like this an

452
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:49,040
extension may be running you or

453
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,770
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these are the</font>

454
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of things and again the main thing</font>

455
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that it's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy out there and</font>

456
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,300
the attackers are usually motivated by

457
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,990
money it's not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone with</font>

458
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:05,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically after you</font>

459
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:08,790
if they find a way where they can use

460
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:12,270
the the login to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create account and</font>

461
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:14,850
benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your site and yours so</font>

462
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,070
you're enforcing some security measures

463
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,439
they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily fight you on that</font>

464
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,809
they will just use the same trick and

465
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,820
find the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy who is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offering a</font>

466
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,100
similar service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will attack them so</font>

467
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,309
in many case we just important to be a

468
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,040
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than the rest and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font>

469
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,750
away some of the attackers it's not the

470
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">best strategy in life but in many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font>

471
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:41,840
it's good enough so with that I'll leave

472
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,840
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for questions</font>

473
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so it's it is a huge problem we're</font>

474
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:11,720
scanning constantly so first of all the

475
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:14,210
fact is that the chrome store or what

476
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,400
browser extension stores are highly

477
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,520
inefficient in fending them off we've

478
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,480
seen it it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a very broad so</font>

479
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,418
we're saying it's highly a massive

480
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,600
amount of browser extensions I mean as

481
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:32,750
number of extensions and deployment

482
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">these extensions are abusing the login</font>

483
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,760
of Facebook and all that both to

484
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,408
distribute so once they they you they

485
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,289
trick you to get an extension that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

486
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:44,270
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> offering a legitimate</font>

487
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:46,279
service and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do</font>

488
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but behind the scenes it will use</font>

489
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and we've seen them either to</font>

490
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,070
distribute that botnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then do</font>

491
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,658
attacks and the attacks could be click

492
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,129
fraud marketing fraud but it could also

493
00:21:53,659 --> 00:22:00,799
be just a vision eldest rebuke things

494
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,270
we've seen them ranking there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

495
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,270
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the google</font>

496
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,520
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> also to rank their own applicator</font>

497
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,129
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chrome extension on the chrome store</font>

498
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,918
and that again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is not detecting</font>

499
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's someone automatically ranking</font>

500
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:18,200
than writing a review so I mean it's a

501
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,750
huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> phenomena and we have scanners that</font>

502
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,760
are scanning the chrome store to

503
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,020
identify them you see that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

504
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,510
many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them that are basically</font>

505
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,908
originating from the same software<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

506
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,890
malware a house and they're extremely

507
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:32,330
smart because they usually will get the

508
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,299
payload from the network so it's a very

509
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:39,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">simple extension that will download a</font>

510
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:42,379
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript payload usually a week or</font>

511
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,380
so after it's installed and will

512
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,120
basically get controls from<font color="#CCCCCC"> and commands</font>

513
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,860
from from there they're using other

514
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,149
mechanisms as well but extremely

515
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,149
sophisticated in big

516
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,110
ok

517
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,950
cool

518
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,950
