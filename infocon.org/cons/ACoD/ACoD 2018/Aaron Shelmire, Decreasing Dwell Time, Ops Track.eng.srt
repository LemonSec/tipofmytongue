1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,290
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my mind as defenders we</font>

2
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:13,110
really have the mission to protect

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,079
detect and respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> different events</font>

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,080
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding and looking at and in</font>

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to detect event the the best way</font>

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,320
to measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> how well we're doing by</font>

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,300
detecting things as to measure how

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,789
quickly and how well we're decreasing

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:33,149
the attackers dwell time within our

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:35,040
environment that dwell time is in order

11
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,710
to detect those attackers within our

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,540
environment we're really relying upon

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,079
threat intelligence data sources whether

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,489
those are indicators signatures

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,239
heuristics or models that were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

16
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,980
detect that intrusion activity usually

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever we look at threat intelligence</font>

18

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do is they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start counting</font>

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,430
it so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go out and we start scraping</font>

a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website and</font>

then pulling that information into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we</font>

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,320
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something that looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

pulling those peak apps parsing those

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a really simplistic way to look</font>

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,090
at the threat intelligence data that

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,710
we're bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in another thing that a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of places do is they</font>

52
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,350
just look at the correlation between the

53
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,720
false positive and true positives and

54

Alex he's not in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore but he</font>

55

<font color="#E5E5E5">tick test of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many true positive</font>

57
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,150
versus false positive indicators you are

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:39,950
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at does anybody know what's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">missing from this in this graph anyone</font>

60
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,920
true negative so in essence kind of your

61
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,600
non actionable alerts<font color="#CCCCCC"> or are we speaking</font>

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,359
the same thing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you're</font>

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,359
thinking of something that you alerted

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:03:00,210
on and it should have been not malicious

65
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,130
but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool well so non</font>

66
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,750
actionable alerts whenever you take in a

67
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,240
large amount of threat intelligence data

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,300
and start<font color="#CCCCCC"> applying it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sims and logs</font>

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,030
and firewalls and so forth what you find

70
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">out is like ninety-nine percent of it is</font>

71
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,820
not actionable there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to go off</font>

72
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that threat intelligence and find out</font>

73
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
what that really meant you're just

74
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,650
matching<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon stuff that people have</font>

75
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,470
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is bad here here's some</font>

76
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,480
badness in my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's way worse</font>

77
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">than having a true positive or a false</font>

78
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,350
positive the true positive you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

79
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,180
bad you can run it to ground you know

80
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's angler you know it's an exploit kit</font>

81
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,490
you know it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lead to some sort</font>

82
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:40,410
of credential theft malware may be a

83
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,780
false positive you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know him that was</font>

84
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,609
google it wasn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal but then all</font>

85
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,900
of these non actionable alerts you're

86
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,550
sitting there and you're like man we saw

87
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,170
all of this traffic to these different

88
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,710
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've no idea what it really</font>

89
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,530
meant that keeps me<font color="#CCCCCC"> up at night way more</font>

90
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,500
than a true positive or a false positive

91
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,750
we spent six weeks trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring the</font>

92
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,280
graph down to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

93
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,730
alerts that we had were either a true

94
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,720
positive aerial false positive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

95
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,220
required a lot of automated<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems to</font>

96
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,670
parse out and pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the</font>

97
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">data and then a lot of my analyst team</font>

98
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,209
working on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the indicators that</font>

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,280
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were seeing and trying to tie that</font>

100
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,750
back to specific threat you end up

101
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,729
seeing a lot of the same threats all the

102
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,280
time whether it's rigged this week the

103
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,950
h1n1 people were janitor what

104
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,859
you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get up on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

105
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it does help bring it bring</font>

106
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,080
those two graphs to that meeting point

107
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,580
but as you can see shortly thereafter

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,260
when the team was all about to quit

109
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,590
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was pushing them a little too</font>

110
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:48,539
hard the graph diverged pretty quickly

111
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:50,880
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to deal with</font>

112
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,580
indicators and to try to get to that

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,530
point where you have things meet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

114
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,820
have context around all of those

115
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,380
indicators that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing into</font>

116
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,530
them it's to produce the threat

117
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,830
intelligence yourself so in this graph

118
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:08,340
there are two different graphs here one

119
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,590
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is based on our malware IOC</font>

120
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,229
feeds and in essence these are now

121
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,239
working fig dumpers and a malware config

122
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,460
dumper if you're not familiar familiar

123
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,780
with it we take pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware we</font>

124
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,729
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what the binary structure</font>

125
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,469
looks like walk that binary structure

126
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,599
pull out the specific pieces that were

127
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,870
interested in and then we apply that

128
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,350
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend database of indicators</font>

129
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,810
using that you're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font>

130
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,810
specific indicator came from this

131
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,820
specific threat and we have a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

132
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,610
those right here the back door feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

133
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,140
uses a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox so if it fails at config</font>

134
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,729
dumping it throws<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into the sandbox</font>

135
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,770
and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the runtime information</font>

136
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,080
and then the other ones are based on

137
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,530
pure config dumping whether that's from

138
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,120
the binary file or from your memory

139
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,679
allocation and carving the memory

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,510
allocation and pulling that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,100
pack<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where those feeds when you talk</font>

142
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to malware analysts and a lot of threat</font>

143
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,880
researchers everybody really loves those

144
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,940
because of the intellectual challenge

145
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,050
behind them and that intellectual

146
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,419
challenge it's like there's something

147
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool about taking that piece of malware</font>

148
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,990
and figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works and what</font>

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,530
that looks like in there so people get

150
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,840
really involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it and you if you</font>

151
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,450
also look at the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphs the config</font>

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,810
dumper feed there in the thousands and

153
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,719
high hundreds while this other fee these

154
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,250
other sets<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feeds over on the right</font>

155
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,409
those are based on indicator expansion

156
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,200
methodologies if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here when</font>

157
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:38,789
Alex was talking a little bit ago he was

158
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,090
talking about indicator expansion as

159
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,260
well so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

160
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:47,080
they're very simplistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> senses I know</font>

161
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,449
bad guys use this domain it ties back

162
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,979
through an a record to this IP address

163
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,280
which then ties back to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

164
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:57,219
domains that methodology we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

165
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,010
very false positive prone but if you

166
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,400
rely upon registrant email addresses and

167
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:06,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">then name servers that ends up producing</font>

168
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,710
much more high fidelity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> high quality</font>

169
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,549
less false positive prone data

170
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,159
specifically around a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

171
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,780
bulletproof posters and I don't think

174
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:25,630
were doing with and and I'm forgetting

175
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:30,010
names right now but people at Open DNS

176
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:32,469
we're doing they created a methodology

177
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,880
in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find bulletproof posters</font>

178
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,229
based upon leaf node in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s networks and</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it actually became very manual</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if we have thread intelligence</font>

197
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,409
and threat intelligence can really

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,410
support three different functions

199
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,240
operations strategy or detection the

operational world your threat

201
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,130
intelligence data is really helping you

202
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,020
out with what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do when I detect</font>

203
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,409
threat X whether that's an actor a piece

204
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:44,980
of malware or exploit kit or<font color="#E5E5E5"> what have</font>

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:47,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you strategy is more along the lines of</font>

206
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">what threats do I have and what should I</font>

207
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,150
really be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a much larger and</font>

209
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,470
threats

210
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,969
should I be applying two-factor

211
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,230
authentication to everything because I'm

212
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,380
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot of compromised</font>

213
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,210
credentials things of that nature but

214
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,580
then the last part and what we've been

215
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about mostly is the detection</font>

216
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,720
area how do I detect threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> X and if we</font>

217
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,390
remember the point of my talk here is

218
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,420
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce well time if we look at</font>

219
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:20,840
Mandiant's<font color="#CCCCCC"> m trends report the median</font>

221
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,630
246 days the medians well time whenever

222
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,460
they receive a external notification

223
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,780
whether that's from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,340

organization or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Counter Intelligence</font>

226
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,800
organization is 320 days whenever they

227
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:42,560
discover it internally themselves you're

228
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,420
only at 56 days the actors that they've

229
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,829
had 56 days to operate within your

230
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,240
organization so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was thinking like how</font>

231
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,730
do I measure this when i'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

232
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,590
threat intelligence data and if you

233
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,090
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that an actor sets</font>

234
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,580
up their infrastructure and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

235
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:02,210
it they create<font color="#CCCCCC"> this c2 and they set up a</font>

236
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:04,220
c2 they register some domains and then

237
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,260
after they registered the domains<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

238
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,030
map it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a specific IP address where</font>

239
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,090
that cpu server is sitting on it and

240
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,480
then they start operating there sometime

241
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:17,030
in the future somebody gets popped and

242
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,980
the indicator gets discovered after that

243
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,569
you apply that<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicator to your</font>

244
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,030
detection and protection technologies

245
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,420
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you have coverage and that</font>

246
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:30,949
indicator is now rendered useless for

247
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:33,439
the actor so what I did is I took a

248
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:36,830
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of domains that are being</font>

249
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,200
ingested as Network indicators and took

250
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,120
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what the date the Delta</font>

251
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,310
between the date of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain being</font>

252
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,170
registered to the date of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain</font>

253
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,849
being ingested for detection and

254
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:51,110
protection technologies and then

255
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:53,720
measured that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up with a</font>

256
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:57,290
graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this and these are</font>

257
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:01,280
bullet charts innocent the portions

258
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:03,349
along the bottom describe the data

259
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,620
points that I'm comparing the data feed

260
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,580
against

261
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,910
in we have our median time for internal

262
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,880
discovery of 56 days for media and dwell

263
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,040
time we have the external dwell time way

264
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,310
over here at the far end of this chart

265
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,730
of 320 days and then this blue line is

266
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,709
the overall median dwell time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

267
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,020
people are going to apply this and start

268
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:31,530
to use this methodology internally you

269
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,810
would make this blue bar your median

270
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:38,780
dwell time what you normally are seeing

271
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:41,910
and our goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> really is to be creating</font>

272
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,089
iocs and detection criteria which will

273
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:49,550
make this blue bar shrink and then on

274
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:52,680
each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these charts we have a</font>

275
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:55,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">marker a black marker that represents</font>

276
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,520
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> median time the median dwell</font>

277
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,490
time between an ioc age between when

278
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,439
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ioc was created to when it was</font>

279
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,420
ingested you can also do this with

280
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,060
malware so if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at md5</font>

281
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,589
hashes or specific pieces of malware you

282
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,630
could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the compile time and</font>

283
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">assuming the PE build time is correct</font>

284
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,340
you could use that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta between</font>

285
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,860
when the malware was<font color="#E5E5E5"> compiled to when it</font>

286
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:24,600
was ingested as your medium I och so if

287
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">we take a look at this again remember</font>

288
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,970
the indicator expansion based

289
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,640
methodologies of creating indicators

290
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,260
took a lot of human resources and it's

291
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,090
not really intellectually challenging

292
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:41,390
and the config dumping methods of

293
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:45,960
creating indicators seems to be really

294
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:48,630
intellectually stimulating but it and it

295
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,730
was creating many many indicators but if

296
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,700
we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from this perspective if</font>

297
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,650
you're scraping OS ink from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web all</font>

298
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,260
of our OS and feeds that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were in that</font>

299
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:01,890
first graph the median dwell time there

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,689
and median I<font color="#E5E5E5"> och was about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 160 days so</font>

307
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:23,729
45 days so you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> far out there</font>

308
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:27,779
does anybody know why that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the case</font>

309
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,639
any ideas well in order to config<font color="#CCCCCC"> dump a</font>

310
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,290
piece of malware first the malware needs

00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,740
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered somewhere so somebody</font>

312
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,629
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to have that initial median 56</font>

313
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,959
days so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way you're</font>

314
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:41,670
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get up in front of 56 days at</font>

315
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,018
that point and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to parse</font>

316
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,519
that malware and understand what that

317
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,800
malware looks like you need a<font color="#CCCCCC"> yard s</font>

318
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,899
thing to be doing virustotal hunting to

319
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,459
pull that data in and then you need a

320
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,129
config dump and process all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

321
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:55,378
malware itself so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to</font>

322
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:58,199
be pushed out farther and farther<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

323
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,939
that median dwell time but then we have

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,609
this malware indicators feed and that

325
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:05,339
one was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really focused and there's a lot</font>

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,709

well<font color="#CCCCCC"> known and really easy to alert on</font>

331
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,929
via virustotal hunting and pulling so

332
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,879
that brings things down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

333
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:25,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting down to a more reasonable time</font>

335
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:32,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that actors registrant feed using</font>

336
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,170
the indicator expansion we can get our I

337
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">OCH down to two days and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't figure</font>

out a way to get any IOC based feed and

<font color="#E5E5E5">threat intelligence data to be quicker</font>

340
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,569
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> two days and the problem with that</font>

341
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,319
is is you know if you're relying<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon</font>

342
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:55,589
who is registered to information then

343
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:58,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are beholden to the who is</font>

344
00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:00,869
registering providers to take all that

345
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,089
information of the domains that have

346
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:04,470
been registered to them today they take

347
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">that at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day and then they</font>

348
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,790
package that up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they deliver to you</font>

349
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:12,059
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> day or maybe the following</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

350
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,949
so you're already 48 hours out and then

351
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,469
you need to process it yourself which

352
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:18,540
put you another six<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 12 hours out so</font>

353
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,240
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at somewhere between 30</font>

354
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,368
and 60 hours before you can actually get

355
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,110
that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your protection</font>

356
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:27,329
and detection system so if you rely upon

357
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,639
the who is registrants information

358
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:31,079
relying upon dns information you can do

359
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,019
it a little quicker you can see when the

360
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,269
domain goes live

361
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:38,139
on a IP address or what have you or a

362
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:40,389
cname but that you're still beholden to

363
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:44,470
some other provider to package that data

364
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:45,910
and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you so everything</font>

365
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,009
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been speaking of thus far has been</font>

366
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,749

bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pyramid of pain and</font>

369

alexs talk a little bit ago but there

00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">are also signatures in an analytics that</font>

we could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using which are a little</font>

372
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:06,579
better to use in my terminology there

00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:08,889
are tactical signatures and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

strategic signatures a tactical

375
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,850
signature is something which covers an

376
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,529
entire malware family but it's not based

377
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,059
if you take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Stork</font>

378
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:18,489

379
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:21,368
you'll notice is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URI in</font>

380
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:23,739
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if this is</font>

381
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:25,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that is commonly done by a lot</font>

382
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:28,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people but it's the way that I</font>

383
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:31,600
learned how to write snorts signatures

384
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:35,799
and then really pushed on my students

385
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,649
when I was a professor to to apply this

386
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,600
methodology as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to try to</font>

387
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,939
not look at those you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are is because the</font>

388
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,790
URIs are easy to change but if you take

389
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:47,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the header orders and weird</font>

390
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,748
things like in this case this<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil rig</font>

00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:52,599
back door one of the weird things that I

00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:54,699
saw the<font color="#CCCCCC"> content type binary care set</font>

393
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,360
utf8 that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange like</font>

394
00:16:54,699 --> 00:17:01,359
content-type text utf-8 that makes sense

395
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,920
binary utf-8 I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little</font>

396
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,569
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took a look at a whole bunch of</font>

397
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,119

anywhere so applying those content

00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:14,379
applying those header orders and

401
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:16,149
especially in this case we have the cop

402
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,339
we have the cookie<font color="#E5E5E5"> first den content</font>

00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:21,369
type then contents length then user

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,438

doing that in a Moore machine language

oriented way which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty slick and</font>

409
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,610
then the other tactical signature here

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,450
employed by multiple families of now

432
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,600
we're at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that</font>

433
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,580
this seems to work in real life is

434
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,949
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovers this offensive</font>

435
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,610
technique and they publish it either at

436
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:51,790
immunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> conf or black hat or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DEFCON and</font>

437
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,979
then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out and they talk about it</font>

438
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a few months later some actors</font>

439
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:00,250
start using it in their actual malware

440
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:02,200
and in for their actual attacks and then

441
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,150
after somebody says oh we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

442
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,420
popped by that and we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

443
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,580
when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to create a detection</font>

444
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,260
down here and the techniques detected in

445
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,540
a few months later somebody protects<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

446
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,940
right now if you were to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me I'd</font>

447
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well Schroeder's Kerberos</font>

448

<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

449
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,290
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going to start seeing</font>

450
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,620
a lot of actors use it's pretty slick

451
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:27,790
but the cool thing is you can monitor

452
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:32,889
for windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> event ID 5136 and alert on</font>

453
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:35,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for those compromises or other</font>

454
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,300
strategic detections are two factor

455
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,520
authentication for the credential reuse

456
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,139
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing and this is</font>

457
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,750
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well known and a</font>

458
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,000
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't but but for some</font>

459
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,700
reason a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't block these</font>

460
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,920
is dynamic dns domains when we took a

461
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,690
look at all of our OSN scraped domains

462
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,050
that we were pulling in eighty-two

463
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,180
percent of them are dynamic dns the

464
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,750
config dumpers all the config<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font>

465
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,100
and malware

466
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,500
running through the sand boxes and so

467
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:08,230
forth ninety-six percent of the domains

468
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:10,540
are dynamic dns so taking a step back

469
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,120
detection utility if you focus on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ioc</font>

470
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:17,740
you're only going to detect a specific

471
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,510
sample or specific intrusion if you rely

472
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,080
upon tactical signatures you can nullify

473
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:25,180
an entire malware family and if you

474
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,840
focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategic signatures you can</font>

475

nullify entire classes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pack this</font>

whether that's a malware family actor

484
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,170
what have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then after taking that</font>

485
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,230
after you have a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data or a</font>

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:08,590
do is sorry calendar<font color="#E5E5E5"> invites what you</font>

488
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:11,320
can do is you can create a this radar

<font color="#CCCCCC">the purple lines are the mean amount of</font>

period<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we have in other time periods</font>

507
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,760
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the server activity there its</font>

508
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,409
way out there at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge so we did</font>

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that reluctant that made us</font>

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,600
collect more intelligence around server

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,620
during this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time period than we ever had</font>

512
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,800
before the normal mean is way down here

513
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,059
and then the manipulators we were

514
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,570
collecting an amount of intelligence

515
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:21,030
around them but now we have much<font color="#CCCCCC"> less so</font>

516
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,850
something happened we've lost visibility

517
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,800
on that actor we know we should apply

518
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:31,110
some resources and effort in getting

519
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:33,990
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on that activity so so these are</font>

520
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the major takeaways for the presentation</font>

521
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:39,900
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concepts here if you really</font>

522
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce 12 time measuring ioc age</font>

523
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,710
is a good way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how well</font>

524
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,580
your data sources are helping you in

525
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:49,710
getting ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dwell time better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

526
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,928
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are tactical signatures and the</font>

527
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,460
best are to apply strategic signatures

528
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:55,830
those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only ways that you're</font>

529
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,309
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get ahead of malicious actors</font>

530
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:01,050
instead of reacting to their activities

531
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:03,780
to ensure coverage establish a baseline

532
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the threat and then measure your</font>

533
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,520
percent captured during this time period

534
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,780
against the baseline and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

535
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,760
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if your detection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zar</font>

536
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,129
useful instead of just measuring against

537
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,410
true positive and false positive also

538
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:20,070
measure against the reduction of non

539
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:30,080
actionable alerts that you have are

540
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:30,080
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions yes yeah yes</font>

541
00:23:31,720 --> 00:24:07,910
correct what are good data sources yeah

542
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:11,630
so if I worked purely on in a defensive

543
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:14,300
organization and I was asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

544
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,930
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create and make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had</font>

545
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:20,750
good detection coverage of things I

546
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,490
would really be driving them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I would</font>

547
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,160
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving them to pee paying attention</font>

548
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,770
more to penetration testers and more to

549
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> offensive classes and taking those</font>

550
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,690
and then figuring out and really pushing

551
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,360
them to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to detect the</font>

552
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,250
techniques and the strategic concepts

553
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,459
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that those people are applying</font>

554
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,170
and apply those<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our organization</font>

555
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,840
first and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next thing that I</font>

556
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:48,050
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do there is i would really push</font>

557
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,909
them to whenever the news items come out

558
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,300
and kaspersky releases a new report

559
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:56,030
about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know the equation</font>

560
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,190
grouper threat acts you know to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

561
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,170
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and instead of just yeah we</font>

562
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,020
can ingest the iocs and pull those into

563
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,210
our organization but really to take a

564
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it and go okay all of these</font>

565
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,760
classes of techniques do we have

566
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection against that and tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

567
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,629
which ones we don't have and then we

568
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and start applying those to</font>

569
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,470
our systems that's that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

570
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:23,150
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does that make sense I kind of</font>

571
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:26,720
walked around your question but cold any

572
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:29,150
other questions I suppose and yeah there

573
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,110
is a lot of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that weird different</font>

574
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,110
sites or something

575
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:50,740
yes exactly yeah so the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

576
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,360
run my group is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we get a client</font>

577
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">request for a piece of malware to take a</font>

578
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it we analyze it we take a look</font>

579
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:00,159
at it and then we go see if it's common

580
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,200
if if there are lots of samples coming

581
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,230
in through virustotal say more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

582
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:09,190
a day or multiple a day I guess at any

583
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:11,410
point then I'm you to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them to</font>

584
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,179
write a config dumper for it so that we

585
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">never have to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sample again</font>

586
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:17,440
so long as the config dumper works and

587
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,990
then once it stops working then we need

588
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">a six-pack in fig dumper if that makes</font>

589
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:30,040
sense yeah cool any other questions so
