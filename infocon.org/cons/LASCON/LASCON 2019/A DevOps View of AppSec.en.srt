over about ten years okay I want you to

18

don't touch my production that will not

34
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:03,079

37
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,929
is the bastard operator from hell if you

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,729
are not aware of the bastard operator

39
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,799

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,030
rebooting it did your parents have any

44
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,030
children that lived

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,850
hey there we go and I want you to

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,260
reflect for just a moment are you one of

47
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,530
those people that runs down the hall

48
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,530
saying

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:40,490
yeah you know you are alright so a bit

50
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:45,530
of street cred about me

51
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:47,540
in 2008 I may or may not have had all of

52
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,100
the registered teachers and Texas's

53
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,310
Social Security numbers in my possession

54
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,790
I may or may not have responsibly

55
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,530
disclosed that I may or may not have

56
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,380
caused somebody to go running through

57
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,890
the halls of Te a to unplug that server

58
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,019
and it may have been one of the largest

59
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,769
breaches in 2008 at the time because it

60
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,850
was over a million personal identities

61
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:16,130
um my wife and I are certified teachers

62
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,280
so I was motivated if that actually

63
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,120
happened alright today I am actually a

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,430
certified DBA

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:28,750
I was a PHP engineer but isn't that kind

66
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:32,420
of oxymoronic I'm a does that even mean

67
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,100
I am a DevOps days Austin DevOps

68

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,010
one of the founders of container days so

70
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,480
all the container days in the world the

71
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,950
first one here was actually the first

72
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,299
one ever was actually in Austin and

73
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,100
Andrew Phillips and I pulled that off

74
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,730
together it was really fun did you know

75
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,560
there's gonna be a dev set cops days

76
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,840
December 16th I don't have links I'm

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,930
sorry look it up the same folks that are

78
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,770
doing DevOps days are putting that on

79
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,840
today I'm the director of cloud

80
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,100
operations at contrast security I know

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,210
I'm not supposed to say a whole lot of

82
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,640
things so I'll just mention that we're

83
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,730
buzzword compliant and you should go

84
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,109
check us out there we go all right well

85
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,149
what I want you guys to understand most

86
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,620
about me is this for all the fun that

87
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,050
I'm going to make of you and all the fun

88
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,730
that you should make of me I truly

89
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,350
believe that security matters and that

90
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,709
applications security matters most of

91
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,719
all because port 443 is the hole in your

92
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,640
firewall and I'm gonna get all your

93
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,100
database see what I did there all of

94
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,120
your database are belong to me the one

95
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,190
thing I want you to remember about

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,110
history is that long before we call the

97
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,770
DevOps long before we were the magical

98
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,390
unicorns there was QA and QA was already

99
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,000
thinking this and QA was already doing

100
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,500
this ok if you're asking yourself how do

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,520
I automate a thing what should I do who

102
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,020
should I do it with and you've got QA p

103
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,219
in your house but you don't have DevOps

104
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,870
people in your house or the DevOps

105
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:55,009
people are annoying like me go talk to

106
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:57,330
the QA folks that's the route okay so

107
00:04:55,009 --> 00:05:00,419
that history of DevOps I was talking

108
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,780
about DevOps actually started with two

109
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,630
dudes

110
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,948
Andrew clay Schafer Patrick Dubois they

111
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,210
got together at velocity they're the

112
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,400
only two that showed up for this open

113
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,520
space and they said what if we could run

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,388
operations teams in an agile fashion and

115
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,380
I mean think about that where the

116
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,270
stories are made up and the points don't

117
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,669
matter I mean who wouldn't want it on

118
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:26,130
that action right that walk will take 40

119
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:29,849
- anyone see what I did there from 2010

120
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,069
to 2012 infrastructure is code all right

121
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,960
you can call it dev puppet ops or dev I

122
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:37,710
AC ops or whatever I was a chef guy

123
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,299
myself but ultimately pup is state of

124
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,219
the DevOps report which they still do

125
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,840
every year is worth reading if you want

126
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,699
to understand DevOps and where DevOps is

127
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,710
today I would say that's the seminal

128
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,539
article to go and find and go back and

129
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,638
read through the histories a bit chef's

130
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:54,210
had an incredible community for years I

131
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,550
was actually in IRC this is back in the

132
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,138
day when IRC was still a thing with a

133
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,639
chef engineer at three o'clock in the

134
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,080
morning we were actually hunting down

135
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,360
something that we'd figured out was a

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,609
bug now that's amazing in and of itself

137
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,990
because at the time I was a known idiot

138
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,719
in IRC asking for help

139
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,330
and they were still taking it seriously

140
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:14,789
like and it actually was a bug while we

141
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,340
were in there a self-proclaimed little

142
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,940
old lady asked for cooking advice in the

143
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,940
chef Channel

144
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,659
and you know what we did we answered her

145
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:29,719
questions while we were debugging the

146
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:31,969
chef's stuff you can't make this up

147
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,259
people and you can somebody can go

148
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,960
search that in the IRC logs that

149
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:40,789
would've been circa 2012 so there you go

150
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,948
all right but consider this all right

151
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:45,169
puppet wasn't the original and actually

152
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,030
cfengine really wasn't either back in

153
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,810
2001 a tiny little company called

154
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,400
Bladelogic

155
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:54,680
which was founded by a guy named dev

156
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:57,859
it's he Arya was founded and its

157
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,840
configuration management and in 2008

158
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,689
before DevOps was even born

159
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,929
2009 they were sold to BMC for 800

160
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:10,069
million dollars divs brother lives uh

161
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,810
here in town he's the CTO of cassava so

162
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:17,090
hopefully he'll have the same success

163
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:19,759
there all right what's the point what I

164
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,619
want you to understand here is this we

165
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,000
as engineers in our meritocracy we often

166
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,219
fight over priority I had that idea

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,560
first I am the baddest engineer ever no

168
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:30,229
it's not who had the idea first

169
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,990
it's who had the best idea puppet did

170
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:34,878
not solve configuration management

171
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,039
puppet made configuration management a

172
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,199
problem that could re reason about by

173
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,699
mere mortals now that's important to me

174
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,120
because I can do a magic trick I can

175
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:47,330
walk out of this room and magically the

176
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:52,099
average IQ will increase okay I need

177
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:56,830
stuff for mere mortals now that's gonna

178
00:07:52,099 --> 00:08:00,469
be a pattern from about 2011 to 2015

179
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,839
see ICD became the thing problem one see

180
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:06,349
ICD is not one thing it is two things

181
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:10,279
the CI problem is solved nobody talks

182
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,569
about it anymore except those people who

183
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,539
are getting rid of that Jenkins server

184
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:18,199
finally because it does all the things

185
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:20,688
right bill does code came along and it

186
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,789
became the reason that Jenkins fell

187
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,439
Jenkins couldn't keep up what is billed

188
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:26,150
as code it's that yema file that sits

189
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,219
right there in your repo that tells

190
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,919
whatever build system Travis CI circle

191
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:33,000
CIA pible whatever then it's going off

192
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,460
to and it's building the thing

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,039
based on the same pull request the same

194
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,020
workflow of the same reviews the same

195
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,848
everything that the developer does and

196
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,860
that describes how the code gets

197
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,290
packaged and sent to wherever it's going

198
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,340
next whether that's a QA environment

199
00:08:46,290 --> 00:09:03,599
am I getting a lot of feedback I can I

200
00:08:50,340 --> 00:09:07,740
can stop that the recording won't work

201
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,970
if I do that all right so again what I

202
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,260
want to point out though is Martin

203
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,960
Fowler how many of you all know that

204
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,180
name yeah that guy's famous right Martin

205
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,720
Fowler is agile Martin Fowler is extreme

206
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,780
programming Martin Fowler is continuous

207
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,140
integration cruise control 2001 thought

208
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,170
works

209
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,390
why is CI a solved problem because we've

210
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,339
been working on it for nearly 15 years

211
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,160
before it was solved we had time to do

212
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,420
it so consider that as you're asking

213
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,689
yourself how do we solve all the

214
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,620
securities we haven't had time yet but

215
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,900
again I want you to notice that

216
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,810
something as code it was in the last

217
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:46,280
talk Jeff Jeff Williams my boss said

218
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:49,739
security is code it's a thing right no

219
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,089
but it should be Oh make that uh I'll

220
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,780
make that argument a little more cogent

221
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,570
here in a minute

222
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,030
okay but in order to practice the

223
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,500
advantages of agile which is to say

224
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,140
DevOps really isn't all the developers

225
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,790
and all the operations people magically

226
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,370
getting together and having wonderful

227
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,800
fluffy bunnies and rainbows no that's

228
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,080
not DevOps DevOps was a bunch of grouchy

229
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,790
old bastards like me sitting down and

230
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,800
saying those developers have a really

231
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,480
good life and we're suffering from PTSD

232
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,150
over here now you laugh but I do want to

233
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,680
point out suicide in operations is a

234
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:27,630
thing okay there is two or three times a

235
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,520
year I get a phone call and I go talk

236
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:36,000
somebody off the ledge in Austin Texas

237
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,860
things needed to change now

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,040
I want you to reflect on yourselves as

239
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,570
security operations people you are also

240
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,649
first responders you are also subject to

241
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,629
PTSD

242
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,790
you need a better and more humane to

243
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:52,529
work as well and let's face it the dude

244
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,860
that rolls in in this flip-flops at ten

245
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,410
o'clock

246
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,379
 some code throws it over the wall

247
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:06,899
and leaves it for that's the life we

248
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:08,249
want right sorry Logan all right we need

249
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,839
our work to look more like developer

250
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:11,670
work because ultimately really all

251
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,009
joking aside the developers have a great

252
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,050
workflow a powerful workflow they have

253
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:18,540
automated checks they have human checks

254
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,868
and they produce good stuff is it good

255
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,790
enough

256
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:26,249
no is it better than what we're doing

257
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,998
now yes then came along docker docker

258
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,949
docker docker

259
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:33,170
hey you have a problem rub some docker

260
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:35,809
on it it'll go away right yeah okay so

261
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:40,579
what's really cool about docker is this

262
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:43,199
again in 1999 remember that century

263
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:48,239
freebsd came out with the idea of jails

264
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:51,179
that's the original container 1999 okay

265
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,050
Solaris zones came out in 2005 and today

266
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,970
zones

267
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,339
although solaris has lost a lot of its

268
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,170
traction zones are still the most fully

269
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,199
featured container technology in the

270
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:05,248
world and docker containers while they

271
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:07,290
still kind of suck so why docker because

272
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,360
of the developer workflow think about

273
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,469
this the developer declares all of their

274
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,629
dependencies including the

275
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,550
infrastructure and when it gets to the

276
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:17,879
end of the build pipeline it's not a jar

277
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:20,099
file or a war file or some ball of PHP

278
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,589
that you don't know what to do with it's

279
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,480
an actual infrastructure artifact that

280
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,660
can be deployed well if you listen to

281
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,829
Dockers marketing anywhere they forget

282
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,879
to tell you you need a docker daemon

283
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,878
right but you know hey that's just

284
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,559
assume all right so the numbers are

285
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,519
actually producing infrastructure as an

286
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,799
artifact that's amazing and the actual

287
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,029
uptake in docker adoption was not

288
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,920
anything to do with production

289
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:47,519
operations that came a lot later the

290
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,160
original 2015 why's everybody adopting

291
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,689
docker was build parallelization so I'll

292
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,819
give you an example of what that can do

293
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,379
because as we inject more automated

294
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,299
tests from security into the

295
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,829
pipeline we need to be able to make sure

296
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:01,289
that we can maintain the speed of

297
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:02,939
building those things so it contrasts

298
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:04,919
right now we have this Java agent that

299
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:07,858
Jeff was talking about and here's the

300
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,359
thing every time we build that Java

301
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:12,839
agent when somebody puts that into the

302
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:15,599
build pipeline nine hundred containers

303
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,859
spin up to run all the tests sweets we

304
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,999
need to run to make sure that all the

305
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:20,899
frameworks and all the things and

306
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:23,549
promises that we make are actually true

307
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,109
now what did that look like before

308
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:27,299
docker well there was a guy named Ian

309
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:29,159
who used to come to the docker Meetup

310
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,619
and he was explaining that a BMC he had

311
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,569
a thousand machines like rats and racks

312
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:36,299
of machines each one of those was a

313
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:37,858
build node and it was super cool right I

314
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:41,189
mean he can do all kinds of wicked cool

315
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:42,929
things think of the expense when Ian

316
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:44,608
when I did the R&D to actually do that

317
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:49,889
in docker he need me one rack of ten

318
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:52,349
machines ever-so thousand machines to

319
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:54,239
ten machines and things were going just

320
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:55,979
as fast now

321
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:58,079
could you just give back the other 990

322
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:59,429
machines yeah sure or he could go find

323
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,258
other things to build even faster to

324
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,159
create faster feedback loops and so

325
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,919
forth and so on

326
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,199
so again docker made a difference in

327
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,959
several different places

328
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:11,909
containerization analog comes to Burnett

329
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,309
ease now if you're holding a conference

330
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:15,809
or you're having a meet-up and

331
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:17,100
attendance is flagging just make sure

332
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:19,649
the next one says kubernetes

333
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,539
and your attendance will double of

334
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,939
course the people that show up you won't

335
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,149
understand them but hey you know all

336
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:27,019
right

337
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:29,429
so kubernetes does orchestration as code

338
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,779
ultimately there's a yamo file you can

339
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:32,789
drop in there that's just a helm it's

340
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,229
called a helmet art you plug in the helm

341
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,359
chart he goes oh cool there are the

342
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:38,100
images no there are the containers and

343
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:39,299
it's all AJ and magic fluffy rounded

344
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,499
bunnies and rainbows yeah that's a lot

345
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,289
harder than that I'm lying to you

346
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:46,379
alright but again there's that thing is

347
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:48,119
code and then there's that time I got

348
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,619
kind of sick to my stomach over the

349
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:52,729
ever-growing attack services of

350
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:55,229
abstractions that are happening here and

351
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:56,970
then the Texas scalability summit back

352
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:59,729
in September here in town Chris Nova

353
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,709
showed that if you don't set deep if you

354
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:04,379
don't change default kubernetes settings

355
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:08,790
it's really easy to hack the kernel from

356
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:11,160
any container from any C group okay

357
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,349
kubernetes creates its own set of

358
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,420
security problems but think about it

359
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,320
kubernetes is really an artifact of

360
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,780
about 2016 it's only three years old it

361
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,390
needs time to develop and mature and we

362
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,750
the people in this room need to help

363
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:30,569
ensure that it's actually secure because

364
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,000
that's what y'all skillset is and that's

365
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:36,450
the skillset we need in our DevOps echo

366
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,120
chamber but again I want you to notice a

367
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,840
pattern of standardization here agile

368
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,380
we're standardizing our work practices

369
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,270
configuration management we're

370
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,340
standardizing server builds it gets

371
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,439
really interesting in a moment see ICD

372
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:52,200
we're standardizing builds and kind of

373
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,370
deploys CD is definitely not a solved

374
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,720
problem most people don't even

375
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,790
understand what it means to commit to

376
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,130
trunk and so we still have that battle

377
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,280
to fight docker was simplifying standard

378
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,740
infrastructure to the point of actually

379
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:08,579
eliminating configuration management it

380
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,450
didn't just make it easier it obviated

381
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,690
the need for the configuration

382
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:16,410
management at all and that was before

383
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,580
chef could even exit poor chef so and

384
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,949
then finally kubernetes is

385
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,510
standardization of orchestration

386
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:24,090
orchestration is by math proof and NP

387
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,770
and complete problem and yet kubernetes

388
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,270
has done so much to standardize it that

389
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,910
if you're willing to behave based on its

390
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,939
assumptions you can benefit from

391
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:39,030
standardization and then Along Came

392
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:41,700
serverless $1,000,000 so as a consultant

393
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,260
for my last few years I saw significant

394
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,770
companies in the PCI HIPAA and FERPA

395
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:49,290
spaces that's finance health care and

396
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,150
education running entire serverless

397
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,540
topologies like their application was

398
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,730
400 lambda functions in AWS okay there

399
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,910
was no if there really was no server and

400
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,970
if it's serverless then it must be code

401
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:07,050
and if it's all code then OPSEC must

402
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,760
play a critical role in securing it and

403
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,010
yet nobody can answer the question how

404
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,710
do I secure a server list function james

405
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,710
wicca can but he's not here this week so

406
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,829
again I want you to notice this time not

407
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,208
the pattern of standardization but the

408
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,398
pattern of elimination

409
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,319
agile eliminated bespoke work processes

410
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:28,448
and gave us ways to talk about work

411
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,059
without having to reinvent the wheel in

412
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:32,860
every conversation configuration

413
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:36,639
management eliminated the bespoke

414
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:39,449
infrastructure see ICD eliminated the

415
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,620
need for bespoke testing the need for it

416
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,929
doctor eliminating configuration

417
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,699
management kubernetes hasn't actually

418
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,679
been around long enough to eliminate

419
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,390
anything yet except a lot of the toil

420
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,830
around orchestrating an application if

421
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,960
again you're willing to buy into the

422
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,539
assumptions that it makes and server

423
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,850
lists well it eliminates infrastructure

424
00:17:55,539 --> 00:18:02,710
so I guess I'll be looking for a job of

425
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,510
anyone's hiring allegedly so thus

426
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,419
containers and configuration management

427
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,850
if serverless reaches its potential will

428
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,230
be eliminated anybody had this picture

429
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,010
in their head of that snake eating its

430
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:17,380
own tail right DevOps is self consuming

431
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,440
because one of the primary tenets of a

432
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,940
DevOps practice not the tooling not the

433
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,600
devs and hops playing together in

434
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,620
harmony

435
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,439
but the actual practice of DevOps is we

436
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,330
seek to eliminate work from the system

437
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,799
that does not need to be done now you

438
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,399
might think yeah go DevOps that's a

439
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,750
brilliant thing

440
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:37,330
no fowler thought of it back in the

441
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,159
agile days you know in the 90s so and

442
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,220
i'll show you here in just a moment all

443
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,380
right but you want a problem

444
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:51,100
jörg and i'll say that code shall not

445
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:53,799
pass right right now when I deal with

446
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:57,428
security people they value the bespoke

447
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:59,679
they're that hoodie person that tanya

448
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:01,929
was talking about yesterday there that I

449
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,419
did all the things and I twisted all

450
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:06,010
these buttons and bad things happened

451
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,899
hmm

452
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,669
right manage me through fear you know

453
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:11,379
what I'm not afraid you know why a

454
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:13,000
business doesn't care the people writing

455
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,590
my paycheck that they don't care you

456
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,690
slow them down you're in the way you get

457
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,939
run over all right

458
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,720
I figured that out is that angry sis up

459
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,880
and and DBA and I'd learned over time

460
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,649
how to deliver value and it took me a

461
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,570
long time cuz I'm dense and I'm stupid

462
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,250
not if you all strike me as dense or

463
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,860
stupid remember you're it's okay to

464
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,390
laugh at

465
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,928
so not BL strike me as either dense or

466
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:40,059
stupid so maybe I can get it from ten

467
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,650
years of learning for me down to you

468
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:45,040
know ten minutes of learning to you I

469
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,690
don't know but you can do this remember

470
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,940
don't be Chicken Little and remember

471
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,830
that you point out the problem then you

472
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,860
don't have a viable solution all you've

473
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,379
done is make people worry and giving

474
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,510
them no way to stop worrying that's a

475
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:03,340
problem that you created and not brought

476
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:05,410
a solution for so I see you all in most

477
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,220
ways as a pre DevOps up I see you as

478
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:11,890
that angry me ten years ago

479
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,929
so DBA don't touch my database sis Atman

480
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,520
no you can't have access to that because

481
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:17,920
well you might be able to take my job

482
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,120
away from me don't lose my cheese don't

483
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,890
a high value on bespoke knowledge and

484
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,899
behavior I can model things to fifth

485
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,550
normal form raise your hand if you even

486
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:32,410
know what relational modeling and fifth

487
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:36,879
normal form means yeah okay I'd like to

488
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:38,320
talk to y'all I drew a low value on the

489
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,610
standardization of practices because

490
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,470
anything that was standardized meant

491
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,949
they didn't need me anymore that's that

492
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,290
that made me less important and accept

493
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,300
that in many ways here's the thing I

494
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:53,020
look at you as a form of quality

495
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,730
assurance with one problem Shannon Leeds

496
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,010
who's gonna talk later today she meant

497
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,660
she taught me this back in 2015 when we

498
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,940
were at a conference together I said

499
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,650
Shannon you're just QA why are you

500
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,880
special you're not special because if

501
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,920
you're special you can't take advantage

502
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,140
of all the things that we're doing to

503
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,370
make your life easier and she said you

504
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,230
know Boyd you're right a lot of what we

505
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,909
do is Quality Assurance security

506
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,000
assurance except for one thing

507
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:18,640
when you all miss really bad things

508
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,890
happen and CEOs end up on the front page

509
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,660
of The Wall Street Journal and that's

510
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,530
not good right

511
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:30,610
there's real worry in this so it's not

512
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:33,309
that you have a job like QA it's that

513
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,559
you have a harder job than QA and we on

514
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:38,950
our side of things on the DevOps unicorn

515
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,629
ride we need to acknowledge that okay

516
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,120
you're playing for much higher stakes

517
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,860
than we were QA finds a thing and it

518
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,809
gets fixed I would

519
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,149
that's because there was a standard way

520
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:51,460
that was known that it should behave and

521
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:53,439
that it could be fixed in your security

522
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,269
example what you have to write a risk

523
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,090
assessment that means that some expert

524
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:59,860
had to evaluate it and when you put a

525
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,590
human in the loop the loop slows down

526
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,029
dramatically and so the standardization

527
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,189
of work is actually one of the things

528
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:08,620
that I believe that needs to come out of

529
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,840
you all sitting here today how do I take

530
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,989
as much of the work as possible the

531
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,080
simple stuff and shove it away so that I

532
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:19,630
can get to the important stuff where we

533
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,570
actually do need a risk assessment so

534
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,789
you know I'll color in the color and the

535
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:27,730
lines there in a little bit thank you

536
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:30,100
and like chip just did yell at me

537
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,600
whenever you want please is there an

538
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,620
extra mic we can give to somebody so

539
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,250
that I don't have to repeat the

540
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:39,789
questions no oh hey

541
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:47,320
turns out chip did you just volunteer to

542
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:48,879
do thanks I appreciate all right so if

543
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,620
you subscribe to the truth that security

544
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,960
is the impediment to business then there

545
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,090
is a great opportunity now before you

546
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,250
think to yourself hey wow that's really

547
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,389
cool and you know go Boyd That's not me

548
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,889
that's the guy named yellow Yahoo

549
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:03,370
Goldratt who wrote a book called the

550
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:05,049
goal okay these are the five focusing

551
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,889
steps of the Theory of Constraints which

552
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:13,029
revolutionized manufacturing in the

553
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:16,959
world okay so this is not boyd BS this

554
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:18,669
is well it's le BS but it's not BS find

555
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,529
the constraint maybe that's you guys

556
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,510
y'all are slowing us down right now but

557
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:24,100
you're doing important work so we need

558
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,570
to make sure you're in the loop how do

559
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,990
we do that so you can deliver business

560
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,760
value optimize the constraint this is

561
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,149
where I'm talking about removing the

562
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,980
toil of security into automation

563
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:39,090
subordinate all work to the system once

564
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:42,039
you guys have come through the first two

565
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,470
then we can make the cadence of

566
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,750
producing software match Security's

567
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,350
ability to secure software and thus we

568
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,210
will end up with more secure software

569
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:56,610
elevate the constraint maybe we need a

570
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:58,590
second security person maybe we need to

571
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,809
move QA a head of security so you aren't

572
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,970
testing bad code we don't want the pages

573
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,220
to be broken before somebody as security

574
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,840
eyes get on it right and then finally

575
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,149
once you've done that you're not done

576
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,428
and this is where job security happens

577
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,479
do it again so if you just look at your

578
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:15,950
shampoo bottle tonight when you're

579
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,620
taking a shower lather rinse repeat

580
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:21,779
who's that guy okay ready

581
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:27,178
puns how do you know when you have

582
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:29,549
Sisyphus I mean all right all right

583
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,139
first turn toil into code again you've

584
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:32,908
heard me say it over and over again if

585
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:34,519
it's done a third time it should be

586
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:37,320
automated before the fourth why

587
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:39,029
automated security tests in the build

588
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,678
pipeline are key all right

589
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,659
QA has already been there and they have

590
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,179
paved the way for you DevOps has made

591
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:48,600
the thing happen don't reinvent the

592
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:50,130
wheel come join the party it's in and

593
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,658
the parties in the build pipeline we're

594
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,850
not hiding from you just come looking

595
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,309
for us it's usually where you'll see a

596
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,870
big TV flashing red saying Logan broke

597
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:05,279
the build Logan broke the build so in

598
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:08,189
all seriousness agile says to value I'm

599
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,039
sorry agile it has agile says it has it

600
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,149
values individual actions I'm sorry

601
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,769
individuals and interactions over

602
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:16,979
processing tools I should know that off

603
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:18,299
the top of my head so I ask you should

604
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,010
we value working automated security

605
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:23,760
tests of romaine yule processes and

606
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:25,350
procedures I think we can all agree to

607
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,549
that but how many of you have that sick

608
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,590
little feeling in your stomach like your

609
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:30,870
jobs are gonna go away because that's

610
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,850
what I had 10 years ago as assists off

611
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,979
and a DBA as I was watching as I was

612
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:37,370
actually automating my job away but

613
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,419
here's a here's a rule my dad told me

614
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:45,000
you know what the reward for a job well

615
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:49,529
done is another job yeah so remember

616
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,360
while we value automation more we there

617
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:53,580
is still important value to manual

618
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,889
testing for example exploratory testing

619
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:59,039
you can you can put that term on QA and

620
00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:00,689
you can put that term on security so and

621
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,370
DevOps what we learned is automate all

622
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,080
the things that's what we value most

623
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,989
but first know what you're automating

624
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,309
that's why I said the third time then

625
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,090
automate it because if you've done it

626
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:10,290
three times

627
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,820
you should have mastered

628
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:14,580
as a manual process maybe you know there

629
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,510
122 steps that you need to automate but

630
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,919
the first time you did it you thought

631
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:21,210
there were only 22 steps right

632
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,620
okay so gain mastery then automate what

633
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,420
does it mean to automate security checks

634
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,370
that's a rhetorical question I don't

635
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,960
know that's the stuff that's in your

636
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,889
head that is not in my head because I'm

637
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:35,400
a dev up I'm not a security how do we

638
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:38,610
gain assurance faster and better faster

639
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,830
and better remember you can go fast and

640
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,000
run into a wall he didn't really

641
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,409
accomplish much there unless you were

642
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,350
trying to you know I don't know some

643
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:50,400
sort of chaos experiment but uh so

644
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:53,399
better matters joining the agile release

645
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,380
train my VP of engineering talks about

646
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,060
this all the time is like don't stop the

647
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,250
release train I'm like dude well puppies

648
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,100
dies like no but don't stop the release

649
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,800
train all right

650
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:08,760
so agile says it values responding to

651
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,340
change over following a plan so I ask

652
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,350
you should we value our ability to

653
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,689
quickly assure Minimum Viable security

654
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:18,179
over a set of checks that happen after

655
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,530
the code is complete and I think Minimum

656
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,540
Viable here is what's really really

657
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,090
important remember that while we're

658
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,639
ensuring security during development is

659
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,530
more important there is still value to

660
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,260
testing after the code is gone live for

661
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,610
example a red team exercise the security

662
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,590
folks at contrast just came to me and

663
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,110
said we want to run a red we want to run

664
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,689
a pen test on you I'm like okay when can

665
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,469
we schedule it I'm like how about now

666
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,910
and then they're like really like yeah

667
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,980
I'm not gonna open ports for you yeah

668
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,920
hey attacker here you go come and attack

669
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,330
me no you want to get in get in and

670
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,520
don't tell me you're doing it tell me

671
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,310
when you got in we'll fix that and we'll

672
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,350
work with you to do it right okay cool

673
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,169
sure that will crash the database but

674
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,820
we'll fix that too all right in DevOps

675
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,910
here's what we learned our ability to

676
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,120
prevent mistakes early saves time talent

677
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:11,490
and treasure you hear the business value

678
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,219
in that last word we're beginning to

679
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,530
matter that's what we value most we also

680
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,960
value most our ability to rapidly fix

681
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,580
things in production which is to say if

682
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,650
a release goes out and something is

683
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,820
broken we can put a release out minutes

684
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,950
later if we need to

685
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,919
we trust our build pipeline we trust all

686
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,690
that automation that we've done our

687
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,820
ability to identify production issues

688
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,680
the vulnerabilities is still an

689
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,899
obligation and we still know this as

690
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,120
valuable so again I want to say that

691
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,880
wizard that hoodie guy that tanya was

692
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,030
talking about that person is still super

693
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,950
valuable and when you think about it how

694
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:50,040
would we know what to automate if hoodie

695
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:54,750
guy isn't there who do you guys telling

696
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:56,430
us what to automate so what could you

697
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,140
and what if you could actually fix a

698
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,050
vulnerability and you know within an

699
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,120
hour of finding it right that's a

700
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,010
superpower okay we found out that we

701
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,530
made a mistake great it's gonna take six

702
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:10,770
weeks to fix it yeah hurry hackers hold

703
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:13,470
off for a while wait do you remember

704
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:15,740
when um was it a snake one for the

705
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,830
hypervisor was a Viper

706
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:21,690
Viper dropped back in 2015 every cloud

707
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,730
company you talk to you they it's

708
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,890
customer service just stopped nobody was

709
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,000
saying anything right it's like um I

710
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,280
wonder what's gonna happen and sure

711
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,600
enough they're like KVM is you're able

712
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,080
to like take over our entire data

713
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,459
centers because KVM great right they had

714
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,850
to hide that because they couldn't fix

715
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,650
it quickly all right so fighting forward

716
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,600
and fighting forward fast and with

717
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,400
assurance because our built pipeline has

718
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,510
those security tests in it that's what

719
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,040
matters now this one's really esoteric

720
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,570
if you've been all the DevOps talks if

721
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,040
you go to DevOps days and whatnot you're

722
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,600
not gonna hear this except if you're out

723
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,379
on the fringes where the Illuminati hang

724
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,570
out safety culture safety culture is

725
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,730
where human lives are at risk

726
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,429
I'm out on a drilling rig and I put my

727
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,250
finger here to help put something into

728
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,840
place and I nearly lose my finger okay

729
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,490
there were plenty of people that lost

730
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,230
their finger before I nearly lost my

731
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:17,460
finger because safety measures were put

732
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:20,100
in place that's safety culture in excuse

733
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,660
me in tech this really came about at AWS

734
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,520
with a guy named Jesse Robbins he was

735
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,320
one of the original founders of chef he

736
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,780
would go around and AWS data centers and

737
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,100
just unplug things Chenin leads again

738
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:33,420
who is talking later she does the same

739
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:36,959
thing it into it during tax season all

740
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,650
right yeah she shouldn't be able to do

741
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,770
that right

742
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,780
we should have self-healing systems so

743
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,250
here this notion of generative culture

744
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,750
and it's often attached to the notion of

745
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,430
agile oh if you have a generative

746
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,290
culture then people have trust and they

747
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,570
they'll admit their mistakes and

748
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:54,090
whatever if you have a generative

749
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,220
culture you can say yo man I screwed up

750
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,220
and I need help figuring this out ma'am

751
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,530
can you help me figure it out please

752
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:04,740
that has power one it tells the other

753
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:07,320
person that you're a human and two it

754
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,240
gives them the permission to say you

755
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,379
know I make mistakes too so maybe we

756
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,040
need to rope in this other person

757
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,270
because I only have this much knowledge

758
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,370
because when it comes to security fake

759
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:21,750
it until you make it it can be a little

760
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:23,639
uh well scary so agile has four values

761
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,080
in its manifesto but it has 12

762
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,630
principles and this is the eleventh one

763
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,639
the best architectures requirements and

764
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,470
designs emerge from self-organizing

765
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,870
teams that's where you get to generative

766
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,260
culture culture is actually a pillar of

767
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,309
DevOps culture automation Lean Thinking

768
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,190
measurements and sharing those are the

769
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:42,960
five pillars of DevOps so safety culture

770
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,640
is the basis for today's common agile

771
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,140
ceremonies in other words safety culture

772
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,510
was around long before agile and DevOps

773
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,480
so if you want to look into maybe some

774
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:52,890
of the things that are going to be more

775
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,300
important as security comes in to the

776
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,590
DevOps chamber I think this is where to

777
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,389
start because this is where the really

778
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,220
high stakes stuff is happening and we

779
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,140
haven't explored it yet either and I

780
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:05,090
wonder if that's why security is only

781
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:07,110
now becoming the devstack ops movement

782
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,970
yeah everyone's seen the button you know

783
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,639
safety it's everybody's concern but

784
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,070
remember when you blame a person they're

785
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,750
gonna hide their mistake when you make

786
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,700
it safe to talk about mistakes you make

787
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,290
it safe to learn this is that generative

788
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,270
culture at the top of the hierarchy and

789
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,460
when learning happens maturity of the

790
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,320
system improves and ultimately we're not

791
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,490
trying to improve our department we're

792
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,040
not trying to move forward our own

793
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:33,960
agenda we're trying to make the entire

794
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:40,409
system operate optimally what's the goal

795
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:42,270
of any company to make money right we

796
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,230
need to empower teams and we need to

797
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,179
hold them accountable as they're

798
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,590
learning I have two college kids working

799
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,410
for me on my operations team right now

800
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,889
that's it and what I got to contrast in

801
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,149
May

802
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,409
the first thing I said to them after

803
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:58,018
watching them operate for two weeks as

804
00:32:52,409 --> 00:33:00,630
y'all are not effing up enough so yeah

805
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:02,640
move fast break things Facebook what I

806
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,710
told them actually is this though it's

807
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,590
okay to break something what's not okay

808
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,559
is to do it the same way twice if you're

809
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:15,289
gonna screw up do it in a new and novel

810
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,289
way all right

811
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,939
simplicity I can't stress this enough

812
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:25,190
it's come up in nearly every talk I've

813
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:27,659
been in today magical number 10

814
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,450
simplicity is the art of maximizing the

815
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:32,130
amount of work not done this is

816
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:35,669
essential remember this is from back in

817
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,320
early like 2000 okay and we're talking

818
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,700
about like Oh remove work from the

819
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,850
system like it's some sort of new thing

820
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,559
No Goldratt was from the 80s he was

821
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:48,360
talking about removing unnecessary work

822
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:50,668
from the system did y'all hear a jason

823
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,289
said Deming de mi ng I have had

824
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:56,070
reference to him later it was from the

825
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:58,049
50s yes okay so what's taken is so

826
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:03,450
bloody lost 60 years I thought we were

827
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:05,070
smart people yes sir how long did it

828
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,129
take for Henry Ford in the assembly line

829
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:10,049
to actually take off so I think it took

830
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,668
him about 15 years and he had to build

831
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,349
his own to prove that it worked because

832
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,418
everyone was resisting change to that

833
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:17,639
bespoke make the wagon really pretty

834
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:23,540
type of thing I think it was 15 years

835
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:26,790
but I'm not certain on that that's yep

836
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,409
and standardization was a big part of

837
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,719
that do you remember the quote you can

838
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:34,830
have it any color so long as it's black

839
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,330
yeah there you go right all right so

840
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:39,089
let's view this simplicity thing from

841
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:40,679
the perspective of the lean movement one

842
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:43,320
must strive to remove work from the

843
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,060
system that's lean is an outright an

844
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,639
outcropping of the Theory of Constraints

845
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,339
by Goldratt and jane ken is the Phoenix

846
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,859
project the first way is to remove

847
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:54,449
unnecessary work in order in order to

848
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:56,219
maximize the throughput of the entire

849
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,960
system and this comes in turn from the

850
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:01,649
work Denning and Goldratt did there you

851
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,790
go Thanks so you can read about the

852
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,320
three ways here or

853
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:08,430
you can pick up the book the Phoenix

854
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,370
project next anyone familiar with the

855
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:13,470
story of Alexander and the Gordian knot

856
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:15,299
okay Alexander the Great conquered the

857
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,100
world such as it was known at the time

858
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,840
right talk to the Chinese I think they'd

859
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,299
have a different view of that but hey

860
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,680
all right the Gordian now is this thing

861
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,030
that scholars were working on to Library

862
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,649
of Alexandria they were trying to

863
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,300
unravel this knot and it was the story

864
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,710
was that whoever could unravel the knot

865
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,170
would rule the world

866
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:33,900
so Alexander comes into the library one

867
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:38,090
day he looks at the knot he looks at all

868
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,770
the nerds any chops are not in half

869
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:42,450
thus unraveling it and going on to

870
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,120
conquer the world this is a true story

871
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,200
at least signs so much as the you know

872
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,140
something that's 3,000 years old can be

873
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:54,109
true and I kind of think he was the

874
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,109
world's first hacker all puns intended

875
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:03,090
so this is me complex is what smart

876
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,220
people do but simple is what smart

877
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:09,030
people who are responsible for the

878
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:12,180
outcomes do okay please keep that in

879
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,320
mind if you have a complex solution the

880
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,690
first thing you should do is seek to

881
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,460
simplify it but we're going to lose our

882
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:21,930
jobs there we go we're all leaving fat

883
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,030
jobs that create value we'll always

884
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,580
replace jobs that have business value

885
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,320
that's not an angel' principle this was

886
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,610
terrifying in the early days of DevOps

887
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,380
I've been running Austin DevOps for

888
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,990
seven years in the first year we have

889
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:38,340
every kind of sysadmin coming and going

890
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:41,220
my job's gonna go good you know what it

891
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:45,480
did the job of the sysadmin has largely

892
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:47,100
gone away and it was replaced by a job

893
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,700
called DevOps engineer again what the

894
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,549
 is that

895
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:54,149
uh-huh but I'll take it because it came

896
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:57,000
with a hundred percent pay raise yeah

897
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,290
waiting all right while there are still

898
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
sysadmin is in the world and they are

899
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,410
still really valuable there are still

900
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,950
people running the hardware that is the

901
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:07,350
cloud and infrastructure jobs again

902
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,600
those same people we value those

903
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:12,110
innovating on business value far far

904
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,279
more be one of those

905
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:16,549
so in DevOps what we learned is the

906
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,910
following it's only a matter of

907
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:21,529
the right place to practice your craft

908
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,788
if you can turn security in the code you

909
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:24,319
will become more valuable if you're

910
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:25,309
thinking about how to turn security in

911
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:27,288
the code if you're thinking about how to

912
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:30,619
enable people to turn security into code

913
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:32,539
you'll be winning that place is a at the

914
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,459
point of creation and not after creation

915
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:36,199
happens ie if it ain't measured in the

916
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:38,229
build pipeline you're slowing things

917
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:41,359
down and you're not delivering value

918
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:44,569
resistance is futile deficit cops was

919
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:48,170
coined by Shannon back in 2015 she was

920
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:49,699
at the time a dev sec ops on Twitter and

921
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,709
remember that there are plenty of

922
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:53,170
well-paid COBOL programmers in the world

923
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:57,109
you're safe

924
00:37:53,170 --> 00:38:03,859
and since admins to just just say all

925
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:05,239
right so sorry unless you marketing

926
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:07,038
versus reality this is what marketing

927
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:08,809
tells you DevOps is right oh it's simple

928
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:13,189
on this dev and its ops and it's purple

929
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:16,160
and it's pretty dog what DevOps really

930
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:18,709
is is messy okay because it involves

931
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,390
people that was not DevOps because there

932
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:22,368
are not clearly too defined and distinct

933
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,339
roles the implicit idea that they just

934
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:28,189
fit together is false simplicity is

935
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:30,890
implicit but complexity is the reality

936
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:32,118
and anyone can do it no anyone can't do

937
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,319
it because if everyone could do it I

938
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:35,119
wouldn't have got that hundred percent

939
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:36,679
pay raise just saying

940
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,999
yeah that's would be a hashtag right

941
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:41,809
hashtag just saying for all you like

942
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:46,160
young people all right there loves it

943
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:49,130
represents the entire system right it's

944
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,979
all the things and it comes assembly

945
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,390
required because your organization and

946
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:56,839
your system look different than other

947
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,538
people's organizations and systems it's

948
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:00,859
beautifully simple at a glance and

949
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:03,380
devilishly difficult to do right because

950
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:05,390
it requires as you pointed out with

951
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,999
those five focusing steps that repeat

952
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:11,660
you don't just do it you are constantly

953
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:14,419
practicing the thoughts of DevOps so how

954
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:17,959
do you get involved what can you do this

955
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,339
is how you act now you can join the dev

956
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:22,640
set-offs movement I actually think

957
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:24,589
that's oxymoronic ok I love that the

958
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,799
security gear has a lock on it and can't

959
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:26,799
turn

960
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:31,609
thanks Veritas I enjoy the I enjoyed

961
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,980
that all right

962
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:35,509
so consider joining forces with an

963
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,220
existing movement DevOps have been

964
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:38,809
around for 10 years and has been wildly

965
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,430
successful it is the way that many

966
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:43,069
businesses are saying this is how we get

967
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:46,058
things done consider that in the same

968
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:50,808
platform is one that you can learn from

969
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:53,480
and jeepers again a sick gear what were

970
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:54,920
they thinking all right so here's what

971
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,170
I'd like you to do most of you are from

972
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,910
Austin here's a local thing that you can

973
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:02,089
do please take out your phones and take

974
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:03,799
a picture of this and the slides will be

975
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:04,880
on but I'd like you to get involved

976
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:07,069
sooner rather than later

977
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,130
I run Austin DevOps we are a DevOps

978
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:14,269
community of nearly 3,000 people here in

979
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:15,829
Austin on a monthly basis 50 to 120

980
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:18,649
people will show up at a meet up to

981
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:23,329
discuss some DevOps topic join my meetup

982
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:24,920

content so when we get 100 people to

985
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:30,769
come out on a month security is usually

986
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:31,788
not coming at ease any more security

987
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:34,459

00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:40,880
run by Ernest Muller and the guys who

992
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,859
same thing they want your security

993
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,410
content they need your security content

994
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:50,269
we want you in our echo chamber so the

995
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:53,930
voice of security is bouncing around in

996
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:55,788
there with the voice of kubernetes def

997
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,769
second phase is happening there's the

998
00:40:55,789 --> 00:41:00,619
link DevOps neighs Austin will happen

999
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:03,499
May 4th and 5th at the Weston and don't

1000
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:04,910
forget your own community as you go out

1001
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:07,939
to these new communities and I'm putting

1002
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:10,160
this on you when you come to my meetup

1003
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,230
tell people about the OWASP meetup tell

1004
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,700
them what's gonna happen make personal

1005
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,309
invitations hateship would you come to

1006
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,939
my Meetup I'd sure appreciate it that

1007
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:19,369
matters

1008
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,480
because some of the DevOps people will

1009
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:22,519
come and they'll bring ideas into your

1010
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,369
community and eventually we will become

1011
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:28,180
one community making the entire system

1012
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:28,180
better

1013
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:37,109
anybody know this movie yeah I cried

1014
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:40,350
okay so I have one feeling and that

1015
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:42,240
found it so how do you pay it forward

1016
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,410
I'm inviting you in in them inviting you

1017
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,779
to benefit from all that we have done

1018
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,370
over the last 10 years if you're wired

1019
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,900
like any operations person and I know

1020
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:50,460
that you are you're thinking well I

1021
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,680
can't how do I take on the obligation of

1022
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:58,380
all that and not give something back

1023
00:41:52,680 --> 00:42:00,690
that's pretty easy really you're not

1024
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,130
gonna be the last one in if you look way

1025
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,480
on the horizon of DevOps right now

1026
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,120
there's dev chaos ops

1027
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,010
there's dev observability ops and

1028
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,509
somebody's like oh well observability

1029
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,970
and monitoring they're the same thing no

1030
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:14,070
they're not and observability matters

1031
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,240
but we don't know how and why yet we

1032
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,530
just know that we're talking about it

1033
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,000
but it's out there on the horizon and

1034
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,590
the security matures over the next

1035
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,680
couple of years of pattern fought that

1036
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:24,300
the pattern holds security will become a

1037
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,250
mature DevOps thing and a voice in the

1038
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,450
echo chamber and maybe observability

1039
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,750
will come next and when you think about

1040
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:34,169
it observability security hmm that's a

1041
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:36,090
good thing they have safety ops as I

1042
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,680
mentioned that sort of fringe talk for

1043
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:41,730
the last ten years around safety culture

1044
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,799
will you help you will help those new

1045
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,810
movements make their way into the echo

1046
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,130
chamber and make the entire system

1047
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:52,020
better for your own presence there okay

1048
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,120
DevOps isn't awesome because I'm there

1049
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,370
in fact you guys should take me out I

1050
00:42:54,120 --> 00:43:00,480
probably get better a lot faster all

1051
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:01,950
right so with that outstanding I have a

1052
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,170
question how many of you have read the

1053
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,730
Phoenix project great put your hands

1054
