people in InfoSec I actually didn't

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,309
realize that I was speaking now until

16
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,530
yesterday

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,210
um wait let me know I was like all right

18
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,280
what can I talk about what's something

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,410
that that's valuable I'm not a super

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,840
technical person when it comes to talks

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,190
I like to talk about soft skills I like

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,320
to talk about things that are valuable

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,600
to me that I think other people maybe

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,240
undervalue or don't hear often enough

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,479
and this was a talk I gave about ten

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,929
years ago I did tt-rs can Hugh second

27
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,170
and it was very well-received I started

28
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:46,560
thinking about our environment today I

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,330
started thinking about politics and you

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,520
know the fact that like everybody is

31
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,200
just butting heads like everywhere you

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,750
go when you're on Facebook I'm seeing it

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,250
bleeding into LinkedIn right everybody

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,810
is just butting heads and I think that

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,450
this talk is a good talk because it

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,490
talks about how do we quell that how do

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,170
we get things done how do we talk to

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,929
people how do we relate it to people

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,400
even if their viewpoints are different

40
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,270
than us even if they come from a

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,900
different place so as I mentioned I'm

42
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,459
Josh

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,040
I run the security team at National

44
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,709
Instruments I've got some certifications

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,260
I also am the guy responsible for your

46
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,640
lost comm bags hopefully you don't throw

47
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,079
them away you bring them home use them

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,230
for your groceries save the environment

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,840
right so yeah in the past I've been told

50
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,810
that was difficult to work with ten

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,490
years ago right I'm barren now I've been

52
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,820
called the dick some people who probably

53
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,110
dicks themselves pretty different story

54
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,540
had problems selling my ideas to

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,340
management to my peers I had

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,230
difficulties selling myself when it came

57
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,610
to raises and promotions I like that

58
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,470
they're taking pictures of this or like

59
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,890
yeah proof in a Java sedan

60
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,300
thanks guys awesome I'd even been fired

61
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,160
from jobs because I really couldn't

62
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,010
communicate effectively with my manager

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,150
and that's a problem if you guys can

64
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:13,399
relate to this this talk is for you it

65
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,070
wasn't really for a lack of trying

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,200
I tried to be the nice guy right I put a

67
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,120
smile on my face every day I tried to be

68
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,500
friends with people I had plenty of

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,900
people around me that I actually

70
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,620
considered friends people would go out

71
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,350
to after work I was a hard worker smart

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,240
I put in long hours I accomplished my

73
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,790
personal goals and I accomplished most

74
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,150
of my professional goals right so wasn't

75
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,130
that I wasn't getting the work done and

76
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,440
it wasn't that wasn't being nice who was

77
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,310
that I didn't know how to get myself

78
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,780
across so started thinking about this

79
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,090
and it's like why don't people like me

80
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,160
why can't I get things done and there

81
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,800
were two stories two things that happen

82
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,500
that really gave me a wake-up call the

83
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,150
first was a musician named Tish I used

84
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,970
to play in a band I played in a band for

85
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,190
about six years and I'd watch this band

86
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,800
at one point in time and I told her a

87
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,210
Tish I was like I watched you play

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,370
I've watched you play MAME any time she

89
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,530
was a singer and I was like I could draw

90
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,220
a one foot by one foot box on the floor

91
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,810
and you stand in that box I was like the

92
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,030
entire show you will stand in that box

93
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,890
and she's great she's moving around with

94
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,539
her microphone whatever but it's in that

95
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,130
box and so if you really want people

96
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,920
stand up and take notice

97
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,790
you gotta get out of the box literally

98
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,750
and metaphorically right but you need to

99
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,700
do that and it was probably a year maybe

100
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,880
two years later Tish came to me and she

101
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,620
said Josh when you told me that she said

102
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,480
I thought you were a dick I thought you

103
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,130
were arrogant I thought that you were

104
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,730
kind of sending I thought you were rude

105
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,770
but she said I realized something what I

106
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,840
realized is that everybody else was

107
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,010
telling me what I wanted to hear right

108
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,609
they were telling me that your great

109
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,680
issue

110
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,780
good job you know whatever she said

111
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,789
you're the only one who actually told me

112
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,710
something that I needed to hear right

113
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:06,530
you're the one who told me something

114
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,560
that could have improved and the

115
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,179
realization here was that it wasn't what

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,699
I was saying because what I was saying

117
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,009
was constructive where at least it was

118
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,719
intended to be constructive the reality

119
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,849
was as it wasn't taken that way and

120
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:23,840
that's all about me and how I was

121
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:25,490
communicated the other one is is my wife

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,799
recounting what my best friend told her

123
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,719
and I might tell the story later on if

124
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,639
we have time I've got a lot of slides

125
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:32,750
here that I need to to whip through so

126
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,000
we'll see about that

127
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,259
but in any case shortly after that is

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,539
when I picked up a copy of a book called

129
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:40,639
how to win friends and influence people

130
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:43,039
it's by a guy named Dale Carnegie he was

131
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,719
a sales guy but the book literally

132
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,789
changed my life reading through that

133
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,580
book there are so many things in there

134
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:51,789
that there's there are things that

135
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,448
should have been obvious but they're not

136
00:05:51,789 --> 00:06:01,580
right so if you take away anything from

137
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:03,650
this you'll read that book now this

138
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,150
presentation actually start with our OS

139
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,029
Austin security professionals happy

140
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,460
hours I was seeing a table with Kevin

141
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:12,259
McCoy who was with four or five dad Dan

142
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,628
had winger who's that set solutions at

143
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,699
the time Matt Snyder who I haven't seen

144
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:19,909
around in a while but he's over a down

145
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:21,500
group now and a lot of the content here

146
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:24,560
is based on the book how to win friends

147
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,569
and influence people by Dale Carnegie as

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,129
I mentioned typically a sales guy book

149
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,620
but it really is a must read for

150
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,669
everybody

151
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,009
so the things that we'll talk about here

152
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:36,378
are things that are covered in that book

153
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:38,389
how do we handle people how to make

154
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:41,300
people like you how to win people to

155
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:44,000
your way of thinking my talk about being

156
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,969
a leader and then time permitting we

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,169
might have some example scenarios so how

158
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:53,000
do we handle people he says if you want

159
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,909
to gather honey don't kick over the

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,060
Beehive and that that sounds like duh

161
00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:00,589
right he said I've spent the best years

162
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,779
of my life giving people the lighter

163
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:05,240
pleasures helping them have a good time

164
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:07,699
and all I get is abuse the existence of

165
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,240
a haunted man Who am I

166
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,770
America's most notorious public enemy

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,919
most sinister gangly er who ever shopped

168
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,419
Chicago Al Capone

169
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,490
can you believe a guy like Al Capone a

170
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,889
guy who's number one on the most-wanted

171
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,830
list said something like that right

172
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:27,139
giving people the lighter pleasures the

173
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,359
reality is that few criminals regard

174
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,939
themselves as bad men they're just as

175
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,710
human as you and I are and most of them

176
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:36,879
attempt to explain their actions by some

177
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,469
form of reasoning may be fallacious

178
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,229
fallacious may be logical but they want

179
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:45,199
to justify their antisocial acts even to

180
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,849
themselves so the thought here is if

181
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,610
criminals don't blame themselves for

182
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:53,960
anything what about people who you and I

183
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,279
come in contact with criticism is futile

184
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,378
because it puts a person on the

185
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,169
defensive and usually makes them strive

186
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:02,650
to justify themselves right anytime you

187
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,969
start to credit critique somebody

188
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,830
immediately they're put on that

189
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:09,439
defensive they're like wait wait why is

190
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,240
he telling me bad things it's dangerous

191
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,949
because it wounds a person's pride it

192
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,529
hurts their sense of importance and

193
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,199
arouses resentment and even though I

194
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,460
criticized tsch and my my best

195
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,939
intentions were to make her a better

196
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,919
performer it took two years for her to

197
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,199
come back to me and go man I realized

198
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,628
you were trying to do that it's all

199
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,879
about how you say not what you say and

200
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:36,019
by criticizing we don't make changes

201
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:38,510
that last and we're often incurring that

202
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:40,219
resentment there and the resentment that

203
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,130
criticism and genders can demoralize

204
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,110
employees family members friends I and

205
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,540
often times they may not even correct

206
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,420
the situation that you're condemning so

207
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,860
we need to do better so here's an

208
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,420
example that they bring up in the book

209
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,100
there's a safety coordinator for an

210
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,479
engineering company and one of his

211
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,920
responsibilities is to make sure that

212
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,920
the employees where their hard hats on

213
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,689
the job in the field right and when a

214
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,180
worker wasn't wearing that hard hat what

215
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,860
do you do we go up to them and yell at

216
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,899
them with a ton of authority be like I'm

217
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,970
in charge of this place I make sure that

218
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,589
everybody wears their hard hats it's a

219
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,819
regulation and you have to wear your

220
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:19,190
hard hat well you think the result was

221
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:22,400
the guys put their hard hats on while he

222
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:26,900
was there and then as soon as that

223
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,449
screw that guy alright so let's think

224
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,579
about this what if instead that guy

225
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,560
tried a different approach well if he

226
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,950
found some people were in their hats and

227
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,079
he asked them what's the problem guys

228
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,190
are the hats uncomfortable or they make

229
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,810
it heavy itchy

230
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,470
do they not fit properly are they

231
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:49,430
falling off your head right and then he

232
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,860
said look guys that hard hat is designed

233
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,930
to protect you it's designed to make

234
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,220
sure that you go home at night that your

235
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,079
head doesn't get hurt that you don't

236
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,710
have to spend time in the hospital right

237
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,360
it's there for you for your help and I

238
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,030
would recommend that you wear this

239
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,360
because I care about you you care about

240
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:11,600
you your family cares about you so the

241
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,420
result of that approach is in increasing

242
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,620
compliance with the regulation and

243
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,969
there's no resentment there's no

244
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,500
emotional upset because he wants to help

245
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,210
right and people care about themselves

246
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,590
and people care about the people around

247
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:29,570
them it's no longer confrontational they

248
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,850
said criticisms are like homing pigeons

249
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,100
they always return home in that the

250
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,870
truth right the person we're going to

251
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,730
correct and condemn is just going to

252
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,940
justify themselves and they're gonna be

253
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:45,980
mad at you in return right that's where

254
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:47,990
that dick comment came from right do you

255
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,540
know somebody would like to change and

256
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,000
regulate and improve how about yourself

257
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,900
right people in glass houses shouldn't

258
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,910
throw stones

259
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,650
it'd certainly be more profitable than

260
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,770
trying to improve others and a lot less

261
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:02,780
dangerous a few famous quotes here

262
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,640
Confucius said don't complain about the

263
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,050
snow on your neighbor's roof when your

264
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,900
own doorstep is uncleaned

265
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,579
Ben Franklin said I'll speak ill of no

266
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,860
man and speak all the good I know of

267
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,600
everybody Carlisle said a great man

268
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,930
shows his greatness by the way he treats

269
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,270
little men so the reality here is any

270
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:24,829
fool can criticize condemn and complain

271
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:27,050
most fools do we can't be fools guys it

272
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,680
takes character and self-control to be

273
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,599
understanding and forgiving so the

274
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,949
secret of dealing with people is there's

275
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,740
only one way to get anybody

276
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,630
to do anything and the only way that I

277
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,750
can get you to do anything is by giving

278
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,610
you what you want all right so what are

279
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,970
the things that people want they want

280
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,280
health they want to live they want food

281
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,290
they want to sleep they want money and

282
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,780
all the things that mine can buy they

283
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,520
want life in the hereafter heaven or

284
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,319
whatever they want sexual gratification

285
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,770
they want the well-being of their

286
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,620
children that's what motivates people

287
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:07,880
right we don't work to live or we don't

288
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:10,490
live to work we work to live the one

289
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,410
longing almost as deep in imperious as

290
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,790
the desire for food or sleep which is

291
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,459
seldom gratified as a feeling of

292
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,829
importance the desire makes you want to

293
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,720
where'd the layest Stiles drive the

294
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,390
latest cars talk about your brilliant

295
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,730
children right you're important and

296
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,160
Freud said that everything you and I do

297
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,070
Springs from two motives he was kind of

298
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,209
obsessed with sex right and the desire

299
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,740
to be great and dr. John Dewey said the

300
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:41,030
deepest urge in human nature is the

301
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:44,390
desire to be important so we need to

302
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:46,490
cater to that so here's an exercise for

303
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,410
you think about the last time you had to

304
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,610
call customer service or technical

305
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,730
support for assistance with something

306
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,460
and the representative was rude and they

307
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,950
didn't end up assisting with your issue

308
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,560
would you do you ball him out did you

309
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,180
ask to speak with their manager now

310
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,800
think about the last time you called and

311
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,339
the representative did everything you

312
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,760
needed did in a short amount of time

313
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:12,110
took care of you was courteous polite

314
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,020
what you do is you just say thank you

315
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,850
and hang up have you ever asked to speak

316
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,280
to their manager in the positive

317
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,310
scenario and comment on what an awesome

318
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,140
job that person was doing how you think

319
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,699
that made the employee feel the last

320
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,050
time I did this and I said hey can I

321
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,730
speak to your manager there I serve

322
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,500
something wrong I said no you did a

323
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,980
great job thank you I'd like to tell

324
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,230
your manager that oh okay let me get him

325
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,210
you get manager faster that way then

326
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,060
like

327
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:43,070
it's awesome and how you think that made

328
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,569
the manager feel so when you tell the

329
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,220
manager dude you do a great job hiring

330
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,410
that person you give them

331
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,930
promotion keep them around right they

332
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,880
get that sense of pride Charles Schwab

333
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,530
said in my wide Association and life

334
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,180
meeting with may and great people in

335
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,430
various parts of the world I've yet to

336
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,319
find the person however greater exulting

337
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,630
in the station who did not do better

338
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,910
work and put forth greater effort under

339
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:08,240
spirit of approval than he would ever do

340
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,550
under a spirit of criticism right if we

341
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,660
tell people we appreciate them if we

342
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,490
tell them thank you for the things

343
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,140
you're doing they're gonna do a better

344
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,790
job so you're probably thinking right

345
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,010
now you've tried this stuff it doesn't

346
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,800
work I work with really smart people

347
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:28,280
they're gonna see right through it and

348
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,079
this doesn't work if you're just doing

349
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,180
it for the sake of flattery right you

350
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,690
have to mean it you have to commit to

351
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,520
this as a mindset flowery doesn't work

352
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,960
with discerning people it comes off as

353
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,770
shallow and selfish and insincere

354
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,020
appreciation on the other hand comes

355
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,180
from the heart it's sincere it's

356
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,710
unselfish and most people really

357
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:54,500
appreciated he can do who can do this

358
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:57,020
has the whole world with him and he who

359
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,930
cannot walks a lonely way think about

360
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,400
your favorite fruit your food something

361
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,930
so delicious that you beg your

362
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,610
significant other to make it for you on

363
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,260
special occasions for me it's

364
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,400
Thanksgiving Darrin it's coming up right

365
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,630
now imagine you're going fishing are you

366
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,030
going to bait the hook with your

367
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,439
favorite food or there's am I gonna put

368
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,560
that Thanksgiving turkey on the line

369
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,970
dangle in the water

370
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,390
probably not fish probably aren't can

371
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,910
bite that so why not use the same common

372
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:29,360
sense when we're fishing for people

373
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:32,300
right remember that you heard only

374
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,700
interested in what you want and the only

375
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,650
way to influence other people is to talk

376
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:42,860
about what they want and show them how

377
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:44,390
to get it so here's an example there's a

378
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,000
lot of peer pressure on kids to smoke

379
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:49,100
cigarettes and this example may be a

380
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,190
little outdated now maybe it's baking

381
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,950
all right how you get them to not do

382
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,510
that your first option is to preach at

383
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,470
them tell them why you don't want them

384
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,910
to smoke how matt'll make you

385
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,880
you're gonna take away their car take

386
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,339
away their allowance right second option

387
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,400
is to show them that smoking could keep

388
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,530
them from doing something productive

389
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,970
from doing something that they love

390
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,939
maybe it's making the basketball team

391
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,350
maybe it's weighing the hundred-yard -

392
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,510
whatever it is which one of those

393
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,910
approaches is going to be more effective

394
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,830
the one where you're telling them you

395
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:26,550
know dad says don't smoke cuz it's gonna

396
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:29,190
make you an idiot right or you know

397
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,839
showing them here's the things that you

398
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,110
want to accomplish here's the things

399
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:37,500
that you value these are gonna go away

400
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,560
if you start that right those are the

401
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,840
things that are meaningful to that so a

402
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,060
few more quotes Henry Ford said if

403
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,680
there's a one secret of success it lies

404
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,569
in the ability to get the other person's

405
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,239
point of view and see things from that

406
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:54,900
single person's angle as well as from

407
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,210
your own 90% of people ignore this truth

408
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,920
90 percent of the time it's not

409
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,720
manipulation to get someone to do

410
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,780
something only for your benefit and for

411
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,870
their detriment right every party of

412
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:10,050
both parties everybody involved should

413
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:11,609
gain from this negotiation and the

414
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,280
takeaway here is that as security

415
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:17,399
professionals you may not be in sales

416
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,290
but you're always a salesperson you may

417
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,000
be trying to sell somebody on this

418
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,069
particular vulnerability and why we have

419
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,079
to fix that you may be able to try and

420
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,109
sell them on why we need to buy that

421
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,750
tool or why we need to hire that person

422
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:32,969
but we're selling something here and we

423
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:36,680
need to do a good job at otherwise the

424
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,390
things that we need aren't gonna happen

425
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,220
so three fundamental techniques in

426
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,340
handling people first don't criticize

427
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,410
condemn or complain second give honest

428
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,179
and sincere appreciation and third

429
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:53,700
arousing the other person in eager want

430
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,910
putting this all together so here's a

431
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,040
scenario for me and again this is from a

432
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,930
number of years ago but I was doing a

433
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,540
lot scanning for vulnerabilities on

434
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,730
hundreds of UNIX systems but they were

435
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,220
all systems that I didn't own they

436
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,960
belonged to the University and I was

437
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,860
working with this team to remediate the

438
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,559
vulnerabilities

439
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,168
and admittedly I did a really bad job of

440
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,570
conveying how this benefited the UNIX

441
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:22,120
team in this email but I did say how it

442
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,639
benefits the company so I've learned a

443
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,199
little bit since then

444
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,970
so the emails have Ronin I've begun

445
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,029
brain call scans using our internal

446
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,039
scanning appliance web addresses in this

447
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:34,870
range the goal here is to eventually

448
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,820
bring down the overall internal threat

449
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,320
level in a similar manner to what I've

450
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,389
been able to do with the public facing

451
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,158
IP addresses obviously this is a

452
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,929
long-term initiative but I would like to

453
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,059
begin by addressing the highest severity

454
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:48,309
issues first as these have the potential

455
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,720
for the biggest impact if exploit the

456
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:52,299
following is a list of vulnerabilities

457
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,370
that identified sf5 and on devices

458
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:56,110
belonging to your team I would be happy

459
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,239
to assist with remediation of any of

460
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,428
these issues please let me know who will

461
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,539
be my primary resource for remediation

462
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:06,940
of these vulnerabilities thank you right

463
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:09,580
so I'm I'm trying I'm trying to reach

464
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,260
out and and say here's what I here's

465
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,178
what I need this is how it's been

466
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,870
benefiting you guys this is how it's

467
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:18,490
going to benefit the company so they did

468
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,229
a really great job at room eating a

469
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,240
bunch of vulnerabilities up front front

470
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,549
but we also found a bunch of frustrating

471
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,769
false positives you guys all know what

472
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,779
those are right we were on the scan we

473
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:30,309
got 100 results in like five of them are

474
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:32,409
actually true positives and the others

475
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:36,220
are because they patch the system but it

476
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:39,220
doesn't show up with scan yeah those so

477
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,690
it started up a discussion on how to use

478
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,630
authenticated scans to get more

479
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,029
actionable results and they were working

480
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,710
with me I needed to encourage them to

481
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:50,169
keep working with me so what I did is I

482
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,990
sent this letter and this went to their

483
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:54,880
manager and my manager so I want to let

484
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,980
you guys know I had a discussion with

485
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,510
Rona and David from the UNIX team just a

486
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,950
couple weeks ago about some

487
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,019
vulnerabilities found in our production

488
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,610
environment by Qualis in the short

489
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:05,860
timespan since they have successfully

490
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,168
remade all confirmed 7 3 4 & 5

491
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,000
vulnerabilities leaving behind only the

492
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,470
low level and likely false positive

493
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,480
ulnar abilities they've committed to

494
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,610
working with me on getting SNMP polling

495
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,169
working on these systems so hopefully

496
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,360
alleviate some of the false positives

497
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:21,010
I'm extremely thankful to them for their

498
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,750
quick action assistance and we're

499
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,210
mediating these vulnerabilities want to

500
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,190
make sure you heard from me

501
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,049
on what a great job they've done a huge

502
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,929
step in the right direction of making a

503
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:33,299
nice environment more secure thank you

504
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:34,830
all right so I'm showing my appreciation

505
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:37,289
and this is very very sincere

506
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:40,408
appreciation I truly appreciated the

507
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:41,730
work that they put into this and I got

508
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:43,200
this back from the manager

509
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,600
I appreciate your positive feedback

510
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,369
we'll continue to address the issue to

511
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,959
get this loop closed on this this will

512
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:50,999
help us to expand the bar and Billy scan

513
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,879
to encompass all UNIX and Linux

514
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:57,840
platforms awesome I'm getting stuff done

515
00:20:53,879 --> 00:21:00,360
this is great manager supports it cool

516
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,918
let's try some more of this you guys

517
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,719
certainly deserve the kudos for your

518
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,519
quick action and we'll make sure that

519
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,860
every security win is as visible as

520
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,419
possible hopefully we can use you guys

521
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,549
as the positive example that other

522
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:13,559
groups should be following I'm looking

523
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,629
forward to working on the SMP stuff as I

524
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,940
think of the value-add there will be

525
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:19,980
large also eliminating false positives

526
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,779
sent Nelson an email follow up with him

527
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,580
on yesterday I guess he's on vacation

528
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:25,679
right now hopefully we can knock that

529
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,299
one out so that you don't waste your

530
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,580
time looking into vulnerabilities that

531
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:31,440
aren't there again I really appreciate

532
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,539
your effort on this I literally couldn't

533
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:38,309
do it without you thank you right so I

534
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:39,809
don't want you to waste your time

535
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:42,779
looking into vulnerabilities that aren't

536
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:46,350
there that's what he wants right that's

537
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:51,149
exactly what he wants here and showing

538
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:53,070
that sincere appreciation so the result

539
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:54,748
was they continued to work with me we

540
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,629
got those off n key and scan workings

541
00:21:54,749 --> 00:22:01,379
and we had outstanding results all right

542
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:02,610
awesome win right I read a book and all

543
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:08,428
of a sudden I'm getting all these scan

544
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:10,979
results done cool man so I sent another

545
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:13,169
email said hey Ronan this morning David

546
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,850
configure SNMP on three systems that

547
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:16,830
were slaved for retirement and I ran the

548
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,619
call scans against them both with him

549
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,449
without authentication with SNMP we

550
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,369
eliminated 19 confirmed born Billy is

551
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,259
four potential vulnerabilities 25

552
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:27,149
informational vulnerabilities below I

553
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:29,490
show which were found versus eliminated

554
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:31,408
if my math is correct turning on SNMP

555
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,999
authentication equates to about 68

556
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:35,159
percent reduction in the

557
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:36,689
vulnerabilities found this reduction in

558
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,879
false positives would certainly help us

559
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,889
to be able to focus our energy attention

560
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:42,809
in the right locations what are your

561
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:45,418
thoughts on enabling SNMP authentication

562
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:47,908
for these scans on other UNIX and Linux

563
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,649
systems is that difficult task or could

564
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,629
we just update some configurations and

565
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:53,968
sync it up thank you both for your time

566
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:56,998
on this all right so now we're working

567
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:58,879
together I'm showing him the value of

568
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:01,079
what he's already done to help here and

569
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:03,629
we're basically saying all right can we

570
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,329
push this a little more can we get more

571
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:08,069
value out of this relationship and the

572
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:10,049
result was Laird that week they enabled

573
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:13,139
offhand scans across all of our Devi

574
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:15,029
test systems the next release they

575
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:19,079
enabled authenticated scans on all the

576
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:20,189
production systems win-win right I get

577
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,139
better results because I have

578
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:23,819
authenticated scanning they get more

579
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:26,549
actionable results with less false

580
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:29,039
positives and then you talk about

581
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:30,918
win-win-win right because in the eyes of

582
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,419
management we're all looking pretty good

583
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,209
reducing the vulnerabilities I can show

584
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:38,159
them cool metrics and I can point to

585
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:39,029
these guys as the example and say these

586
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,739
guys did awesome

587
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:45,149
hey windows team let's do this right in

588
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:47,099
fact the desktop security administer

589
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:48,869
heard about what I was doing here with

590
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:50,729
the UNIX team and he came to me and is

591
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:53,039
like hey how did I get those guys to

592
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,989
work with me we've been trying for years

593
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,319
to get them to implement EPL on their

594
00:23:54,989 --> 00:24:01,219
systems and wasn't getting results and

595
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:04,249
so I was able to help him do that

596
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:09,599
all right how do we make people like us

597
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:12,689
it's an age-old question right so if you

598
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,428
do this you'll be welcoming where New

599
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:16,469
York telephone company made a detailed

600
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:18,599
study of telephone conversations to find

601
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:21,349
out which word is most frequently used

602
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,698
you want to know what that word was I

603
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:26,458
three thousand nine hundred times and

604
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:28,259
five hundred telephone conversations all

605
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:31,769
right that's a lot that's almost eight

606
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:34,349
times per conversation so when you see a

607
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:36,749
photograph that you're in what picture

608
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:40,499
do you look at first yours

609
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:42,539
right Alfred Adler said is the

610
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:43,979
individual who is not interested in its

611
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,639
fellow men who has the greatest

612
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:48,159
difficulties in life and

613
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:50,228
the greatest injury to others is from

614
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,229
among such individuals that all human

615
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:56,440
failures sprint so what we learned here

616
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:58,989
is the most important to any person the

617
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,320
most important person to any person is

618
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:04,899
themselves people aren't interested in

619
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,418
you they're not interested in me they're

620
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:09,728
interested in themselves morning noon

621
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:12,219
night now certainly there's exceptions

622
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:13,899
right and there's people who take time

623
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:16,869
to help other people and things like

624
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:19,570
that but you can make more friends in

625
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:21,789
two months by becoming interested in

626
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,168
other people than you can in two years

627
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:25,899
by trying to get other people interested

628
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:27,579
in you that's the reality when we when

629
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,988
we start to talk to other people about

630
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:32,019
things that they like things that

631
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:36,039
they're interested in we're gonna get to

632
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:38,200
know them a lot faster if we want to

633
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,299
make friends put ourselves out there to

634
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,950
do things for other people things that

635
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:46,149
require time that require energy

636
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:49,089
unselfishness thoughtfulness I received

637
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:52,718
a holiday card from from a friend a

638
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:55,570
while back and it was just a very simple

639
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:57,609
holiday card Bo's handwritten and it

640
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,139
basically said like dear Josh thanks for

641
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:00,999
everything you do I really appreciate

642
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:05,589
your friendship super simple like two

643
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:07,869
sentences that holiday card meant a lot

644
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:10,359
to me because what meant is that he

645
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:11,769
thought about me when he could been

646
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:14,619
thinking about tons of other things

647
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:17,440
going on that he took the time out of

648
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:19,899
his day to write something handwritten

649
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,950
to put in an envelope to write my

650
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:25,658
address on and to mail it to me right so

651
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,579
that single thing it probably didn't

652
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:30,940
take him more than you know couple mins

653
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:32,889
something like that people say it's the

654
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,229
thought that counts in this case it was

655
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:37,299
absolutely the thought that counts and I

656
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:39,659
thought very highly of him after that

657
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:42,459
point so if we want to make friends

658
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,249
let's greet people with AM nation with

659
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:47,859
enthusiasm all right let's be happy to

660
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:50,169
be their friend so a simple way to make

661
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:53,039
a good first impression who would you

662
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:53,039
rather get to know better

663
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:02,950
which one of those guys you like those

664
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:06,390
guys what about that guy that guy that

665
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:09,790
guy that guy that guy this guy right

666
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:11,160
looks way nicer super friendly it's got

667
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:13,270
a smile on his face

668
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,380
last one guy looks at you longingly

669
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:18,790
right the expression one wears on their

670
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,310
face is far more important than the

671
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,590
clothes one wears on one's back right it

672
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,690
doesn't matter what we're wearing if

673
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,330
we're smiling if we're happy we're

674
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:30,700
friendly people want to approach us well

675
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:34,389
I get to know us they wanna be part of

676
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,610
that fun Club right actions speak louder

677
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,430
than words and a smile basically says I

678
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:43,270
like you you make me happy I'm glad to

679
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:46,000
see people rarely succeed at anything

680
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:48,070
unless they have fun doing it so you

681
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,470
have to have a good time meeting people

682
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,889
if you expect them to have a good time

683
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,020
being you all right if you don't feel

684
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,240
like smiling what'd you do well make

685
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,070
yourself smile right if you're alone

686
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,420
force yourself to whistle humma tune

687
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:06,129
sing act as if you were already happy

688
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,580
happiness doesn't depend on out work

689
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,990
conditions it depends on what's in here

690
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,330
there's an ancient Chinese proverb that

691
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,260
said a man with a smiling face must not

692
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,530
open a shop

693
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,629
no boys can buy from that dude right you

694
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,800
know walk into the shop and be like I

695
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:24,220
wanna live from the meanest looking

696
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:28,840
person here gonna be a weird shop maybe

697
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:30,010
like a Halloween shop or something if

698
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,300
you don't do this you're Haim for

699
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,360
trouble anybody know what all these

700
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,770
things have in common

701
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,260
Tanya hit her candy down here maybe I

702
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:44,590
can throw us on that whoever is that

703
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:46,890
okay no boy no guesses you know that's

704
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,889
the day

705
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,959
wasn't the right answer but it is a

706
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:57,199
correct answer good job I just stole

707
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Tanya's candy don't tell her she all

708
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,419
right all these seeds were named after

709
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,519
people every single one of those days

710
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,799
Austin was named after Stephen Austin

711
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,049
Baltimore was named after Lord Baltimore

712
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,379
every single one of those cities was

713
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:14,629
named after a person so what's in a name

714
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,190
people are so proud of their names that

715
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,460
they strive to perpetuate them at any

716
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:21,559
cost right the average person is more

717
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,130
interested in their own name than all

718
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:27,019
other names on earth put together

719
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,309
remember that name called easily and

720
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:32,029
you've paid a subtle and effective

721
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:33,950
compliment all right forget it misspell

722
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,200
it and you've placed yourself at a sharp

723
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,700
disadvantage

724
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,169
most people don't remember names for the

725
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,669
simple reason that they don't take the

726
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:43,279
time and the energy necessary to

727
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:45,649
concentrate and repeat and fix that name

728
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,960
in their mind they make excuses for

729
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:55,340
themselves I'm too busy man I'm so

730
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:58,639
forgetful I just hit 40 write the name

731
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,250
sets an individual apart what make it's

732
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:06,080
what makes them unique amongst all other

733
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:09,169
people so if you didn't hear the name

734
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,139
distinctly say oh man I'm sorry I didn't

735
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:14,480
get that name clearly if it's an unusual

736
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:18,408
name I have a lot of trouble with Indian

737
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,000
names say how's that spelt right and

738
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:22,510
hopefully they'll they'll spell it out

739
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,159
for you okay got it

740
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:29,330
during the conversation take the trouble

741
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:30,769
to repeat the name several times and try

742
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,539
to associate in your mind with the

743
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:34,880
person's features their expressions

744
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,010
their appearance you're basically trying

745
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,510
to commit to memory

746
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,350
that's Wade Wilson that's whay Wilson

747
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,330
that's what Wilson

748
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:46,100
that's Deadpool sorry

749
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:47,989
true story alright so the six ways to

750
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,840
make people like you first become

751
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:51,249
genuinely interested in other people

752
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,230
smile

753
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,970
remember that person's name is to that

754
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,190
person the sweetest and most important

755
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,690
sound in a language be a good listener

756
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,210
encourage others to talk about

757
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,220
themselves talk in terms of the other

758
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,950
person's interests and make the other

759
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:12,139
person feel important but you have to be

760
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:14,600
sincere alright so how do we win people

761
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:16,428
to our way of thinking how do we

762
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,168
convince management that we need to fix

763
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:22,929
that vulnerability or whatever

764
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:25,789
first thing is you can't win an argument

765
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:27,830
nine times out of ten an argument ends

766
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:31,908
with both of the people firmly convinced

767
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:36,889
that they're absolutely right what we're

768
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:37,460
arguing on Facebook does anybody win all

769
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:40,389
right

770
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:43,190
Trump this Obama this doesn't matter

771
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:48,408
both sides go away and they're like and

772
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:51,350
screw that guy suppose you triumph over

773
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:55,220
the other person and you dump so many

774
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:57,379
facts on them that like fax back machine

775
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:01,480
right you shoot their argument full of

776
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:03,859
holes prove that he's an idiot

777
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,129
feeling pretty good man I taught that

778
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:09,980
guy you made him feel inferior you hurt

779
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:13,668
his pride you know probably resent you

780
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:16,249
a man convinced against his will is of

781
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:20,749
the same opinion still right if that

782
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:26,059
person didn't buy into that you ain't

783
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:29,330
changed their mind Ben Franklin said if

784
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:30,889
you argue and wrinkle and contradict you

785
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,928
might achieve a victory sometimes

786
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:34,309
they'll be an empty victory because

787
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:37,039
you'll never get your opponent's good

788
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:40,609
will so would you rather have an

789
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:45,139
academic theatrical victory would you

790
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:46,519
rather have a person's good will what

791
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:50,879
does the other person you're arguing

792
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:54,090
with what they want to feel important

793
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,150
so how can they get it do they give by

794
00:32:54,090 --> 00:33:01,050
loudly asserting their authority or by

795
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:02,630
you acknowledging it I preferred the

796
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:05,220
latter right

797
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:10,310
Buddha said hatred is never ended by

798
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:12,360
hatred but I love don't hate

799
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:15,840
misunderstanding is never ended by an

800
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,389
argument by tact diplomacy conciliation

801
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,830
and a sympathetic desire to see the

802
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:24,780
other person's viewpoint so how do we

803
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,540
keep a disagreement from becoming an

804
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,160
argument there's an article tiled bits

805
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,790
and pieces that was published by the

806
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:35,250
economic Press and says if there's some

807
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,920
point that you haven't thought about be

808
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,060
thankful Fitz brought to your attention

809
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,470
perhaps it's your opportunity to be

810
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,770
corrected before you make a serious

811
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:46,080
mistake all right cool maybe I don't

812
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,639
know everything maybe that thing that

813
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,850
that person just told me I didn't

814
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,550
realize that maybe I can be thankful for

815
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:55,080
it hey I didn't really consider that now

816
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,419
our first natural reaction is to be

817
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:01,770
disagreeable to be defensive let's keep

818
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:04,770
calm control our temper give them a

819
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:08,070
chance to talk don't interrupt them let

820
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:11,460
them finish don't resist don't defend

821
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:14,100
don't debate let's listen let's hear

822
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:18,300
what they have to say all right

823
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:20,400
I've heard you act so when you've

824
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,820
finally heard your opponent now dwell on

825
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,330
the points the areas that you agree

826
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:30,410
let's find some common ground here if

827
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:34,520
there's areas where I can admit error

828
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:38,239
hey I'm sorry I didn't realize that all

829
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:41,810
right we're making headway here

830
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:44,669
maybe promise to think over their ideas

831
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:48,270
yeah that's interesting I should look

832
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:52,100
into that more right they might be right

833
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:55,710
who knows thank them for their interest

834
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:58,560
and you know I realized we don't see gun

835
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,420
control the same way but I really

836
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,480
appreciate that you're entrusting this

837
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,829
right thanks for your time thanks for

838
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,890
telling me that stuff I didn't realize

839
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:10,319
that anyone who takes the time to

840
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:14,549
disagree with you is interest in the

841
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:17,279
same things you are right maybe postal

842
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:19,650
postpone the action let's give each

843
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,190
other some time to think through mmm ask

844
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:25,710
ourselves could they be right are they

845
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:28,470
part right is there some truth there

846
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,240
merit in their argument is my reaction

847
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,058
one that's gonna relieve the problem or

848
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,939
is it just gonna relieve some

849
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:37,890
frustration well my reaction drive my

850
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,950
opponents further away or will it draw

851
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:44,430
them closer am i go win or lose what

852
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:46,890
price do I pay if I win what price do I

853
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:52,500
pay if I lose is this difficult

854
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:56,220
situation and opportunity for me now you

855
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:01,859
can tell people they're wrong by a look

856
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:04,319
by an intonation by a gesture just as

857
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:06,750
eloquently as you can in words and if

858
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:10,440
you tell them they're wrong do you make

859
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,760
them want to agree with you no you just

860
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,589
struck a direct blow of their

861
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,349
intelligence their judgment their pride

862
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:18,509
their self-respect it arouses opposition

863
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:22,859
and makes the listener want to battle

864
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:24,059
with you before you even start word to

865
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:28,859
the wise never start off a conversation

866
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:30,780
with the middle finger so Alexander Pope

867
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:33,569
said men must be taught as if you taught

868
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,660
them not and things unknown proposed as

869
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:39,540
things forgotten the interesting Galileo

870
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,950
said you cannot teach a man anything you

871
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,000
can only help him to find it within

872
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:47,430
himself all right so what we're saying

873
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,069
here is that somebody has to figure this

874
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:52,500
out for themselves we can't convince

875
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:54,390
them we can't yell at them we have to

876
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,150
help them draw that conclusion for

877
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:59,819
themselves Lord Chesterfield said be

878
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,790
wiser than other people if you can but

879
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:04,589
don't tell them so always seek to enrich

880
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,529
yourself seek to make yourself smarter

881
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:09,450
that's cool but never be the bragger

882
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,510
never be the person who says man I'm

883
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:15,430
smarter than everybody else yeah

884
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,670
Socrates said one thing only I know and

885
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:21,250
that's that I know nothing my wife

886
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:23,830
sometimes tells me like and you know you

887
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,720
like I don't know anything about any of

888
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,080
this stuff you know your security bla

889
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,810
bla bla

890
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,819
I know look I never worked at a vet's

891
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:34,779
office you know way more about animals

892
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,970
than I do we all have areas of expertise

893
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,780
we all have experiences that we can draw

894
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:43,060
on and reality is you don't want to

895
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,770
trust me to work on your animal when

896
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,759
it's sick you don't even want to trust

897
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:51,790
me for advice my wife on the other hand

898
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,510
people call her right they don't call

899
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,950
her for the InfoSec stuff though if a

900
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,230
person makes a statement that you think

901
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,220
is wrong maybe even something that you

902
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,860
know is wrong

903
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:06,089
is it better to begin by saying look I

904
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:08,890
thought otherwise but I may be wrong

905
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,860
oftentimes I am my wife tells me I am a

906
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:14,100
lot and if I'm wrong I want to be put

907
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,990
right so let's look at the facts

908
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:21,339
you're never getting in tune in to

909
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:23,439
trouble simply for it mainly wrong it'll

910
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,990
stop all arguments and you'll probably

911
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,950
inspire your opponent to be just as fair

912
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:33,120
and open-minded as you are make him want

913
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:37,000
to admit that he too may be wrong right

914
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,529
we're drawing common ground so if you

915
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,720
know you're gonna be rebuked anyhow

916
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,990
isn't it better to beat the other person

917
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,180
to it and do it ourselves isn't it

918
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:49,540
easier to listen to self-criticism than

919
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:51,430
to bear condemnation from alien lips say

920
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,110
about yourself all the derogatory things

921
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,930
you know the other person is thinking or

922
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:59,500
wants to say and tends to say like hey

923
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:02,169
I'm a dick I get it and say them before

924
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,390
that person has a chance to say it it's

925
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,730
kind of funny after I gave this talk the

926
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,990
very first time I had somebody come up

927
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,120
to me he's like you know your

928
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,990
presentation was right I was like where

929
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,710
are you talking about things like you

930
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,709
are a dick

931
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:23,919
cool man it's up there he was on the

932
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:26,320
screen yeah I know chances are a hundred

933
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,090
to one that generous forgiving attitude

934
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,510
will be taken and your mistakes are

935
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,980
going to be minimized so there's a

936
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,540
certain degree of satisfaction and

937
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,970
having the courage to admit one's errors

938
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:39,009
it doesn't only clear the air of guilt

939
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,680
and offensiveness but often helps solve

940
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,510
the problem created by the air and any

941
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,750
fool can try to defend his or her

942
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,850
mistakes most fools do but it raises one

943
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,830
above the herd and gives a feeling of

944
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:54,400
nobility and a exultation

945
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:56,020
to admit one's mistakes sometimes it

946
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,800
actually kind of feels good to be like

947
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:01,810
dude you're right that was wrong as a

948
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,880
lot more fun to be honest and mid are

949
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,420
mistakes than to try and defend yourself

950
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,770
it's just digging the hole further right

951
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,620
there's an old proverb that says by

952
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:13,830
fighting you never get enough but by

953
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,529
yielding you get more than you expected

954
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,910
all right

955
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:21,250
Woodrow Wilson said if you come at me

956
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,720
with your fists doubled I think I can

957
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,850
promise you that mine will double as

958
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,040
fast as yours but if you come to me and

959
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:29,140
say let's sit down let's take counsel

960
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,230
together and if we differ from each

961
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:35,170
other understand why we differ just what

962
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:36,880
the points at issues are we will

963
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,010
presently find that we're not so far

964
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,870
apart after all that the points on which

965
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:43,210
we differ are few and the points on

966
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,160
which we agree are many and that if we

967
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,590
only have the patience and the candor

968
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:52,740
and the desire to get together we'll get

969
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:52,740
together it's quite the statesman right

970
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,240
Lincoln said it's an old true maxim that

971
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,700
drop of honey catches more flies than a

972
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,160
gallon of golf so with men if you would

973
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,259
win a man to your cause first convince

974
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,899
him that you're his friend since your

975
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,210
friend Darren is a drop of honey that

976
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,890
catches his heart which say what you

977
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:16,240
will is the great high road to his

978
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:18,270
reason the use of relentless of

979
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,470
gentleness and friendliness is

980
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,090
demonstrated day after day by people

981
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:25,370
who've learned that drop of Heian

982
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:31,430
catches more flies than a gallon of golf

983
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:33,500
or jar of vinegar secret of Socrates in

984
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,850
talking with people don't begin by

985
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,160
discussing the things on which you

986
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,920
different that's how we start the

987
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,540
argument we start by emphasizing and

988
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,510
keep emphasizing the things that we

989
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,130
agree on keep emphasizing if possible

990
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:49,790
that we're both striving for the same

991
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:53,270
end and that your only difference is the

992
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:56,630
method not the purpose get the other

993
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:58,430
person saying yes yes at the outset you

994
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:02,180
don't want your you're the other person

995
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:04,549
to be saying no no response is the most

996
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:08,120
difficult handicap to overcome when

997
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:10,610
you've said no your pride of personality

998
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,319
demands that you remain consistent with

999
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:14,900
yourself well I said no I gotta keep

1000
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,630
saying them right don't make my point

1001
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:22,280
and you might layer feel that the noah's

1002
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:25,700
ill-advised but you got your pride to

1003
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,130
consider so once having said a thing you

1004
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,600
feel like you got a stick to it alright

1005
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:35,210
how often do you feel this way with kids

1006
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:37,520
you're like I said no all right so it's

1007
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:39,440
one of the very greatest importance that

1008
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,230
person B started in the affirmative

1009
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,720
direction get them to say yes the

1010
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:47,450
skillful speaker gets at the outset yes

1011
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,580
responses and it sets the psychological

1012
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,620
process of the listeners moving in the

1013
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,290
affirmative direction oh yeah I said yes

1014
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:58,430
to that said yes to that yeah cool it's

1015
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:59,930
called the Socratic method most people

1016
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,819
trying to win others to their way of

1017
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:04,430
thinking do too much talking themselves

1018
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,770
let the other people talk themselves out

1019
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,000
they know more about their business and

1020
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,790
their problems than you do ask questions

1021
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,290
let them tell you more don't interrupt

1022
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,730
them if you disagree with them they're

1023
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,230
not gonna pay attention to you while

1024
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:17,780
they have that all these ideas flowing

1025
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:20,030
out let them get it out but be sincere

1026
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,850
about it encourage them to express their

1027
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,740
ideas fully and even our friends would

1028
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,960
much rather talk to us about their

1029
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:30,169
achievements than listen to us boast

1030
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,450
about ours I don't think we have time

1031
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:35,060
for the story but the lesson here is

1032
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:38,810
when our friends excel us they feel

1033
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,650
important but when we excel them they or

1034
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:44,210
at least

1035
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:46,970
feel inferior and envious so how do we

1036
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,620
get cooperation don't you have a lot

1037
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,480
more faith in ideas that you discover

1038
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,920
for yourself and ideas that are handed

1039
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,470
to a silver platter

1040
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,000
and if so what could be bad judgment to

1041
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,490
try and RAM your opinions down the

1042
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,500
throats of other people wouldn't it be

1043
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,330
wiser to make suggestions and let that

1044
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,900
other person come to their own

1045
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:08,600
conclusion Ralph Waldo Emerson said in

1046
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,940
every work of genius we recognize our

1047
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:15,020
own rejected thoughts that come back to

1048
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:17,990
us with a certain alien and majesty we

1049
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:21,470
don't have to take the credit they can

1050
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:26,990
have the credit I'd rather have the

1051
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:29,060
results let's say said the reason why

1052
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,859
rivers and seas receive the homage of a

1053
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,140
hundred mountain streams is that they

1054
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,450
keep below them thus they're able reign

1055
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,220
over all the mountain streams so the

1056
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,620
sage wishing to be above men could

1057
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,750
himself below them wishing to be before

1058
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:44,180
them he put himself behind them thus

1059
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,850
those place be above men they don't feel

1060
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,839
as wait those place be before them they

1061
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:53,089
don't count in an injury so people may

1062
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,390
be totally wrong but they're not gonna

1063
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:59,630
think so don't condemn them any fool can

1064
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,549
do that try to understand them there's a

1065
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,430
reason why they think and act the way

1066
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,860
that they do figure out that reason and

1067
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:09,290
you now know why they're acting the way

1068
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:12,650
they do you know why they are who they

1069
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:14,860
are and try to honestly put yourself in

1070
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:18,680
their place

1071
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:21,230
everyone wants there's a magic phrase

1072
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,240
that stops arguments eliminates ill

1073
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,830
feelings creates goodwill makes the

1074
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,350
other person listen attentively and

1075
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:30,380
that's I don't blame you one iota from

1076
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:34,160
feeling as if you do if I were you I

1077
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:37,570
would undoubtedly feel just as you do if

1078
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,350
I were you right because that's true

1079
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,820
three-fourths of the people you'll ever

1080
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,620
meet are hungry and thirsting for

1081
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,860
sympathy give it to them and they'll

1082
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:47,990
love you all people you meet have a high

1083
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,490
regard for themselves and like to be

1084
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,319
fine and unselfish in their own

1085
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:55,049
estimation JP or ma Morgan said up

1086
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,910
person usually has two reasons for doing

1087
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,730
a thing one that sounds good in the real

1088
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:01,830
one so the person himself will think

1089
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:04,710
that the real reason so you don't need

1090
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:06,360
to emphasize that and all of us being

1091
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,850
idealists at heart like to think of

1092
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,920
motives that sound good in order to

1093
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,810
change people appeal to the nobler

1094
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,340
motives

1095
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:16,890
merely staying a truth isn't enough the

1096
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:20,700
truth has to be made vivid interesting

1097
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:22,830
and dramatic showmanship movies do it TV

1098
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,649
does it and if you want attention you're

1099
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:27,000
gonna have to do it too

1100
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,270
Schwab said the way to get things done

1101
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,060
is to stimulate competition competition

1102
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:37,110
I do not mean a sword money game way

1103
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:40,529
when in a desire to excel desire to

1104
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,220
excel a challenge throwing down the

1105
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,500
gauntlet

1106
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:47,339
it's an infallible way of appealing to

1107
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,170
the people of spirit every successful

1108
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,390
person loves the game the chance for

1109
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:53,880
self-expression the chance to prove his

1110
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:57,509
or her worth to excel to win the feeling

1111
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:01,410
of importance so that's how we win

1112
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:03,660
people to our way of thinking avoid the

1113
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,370
argument and show respect for the other

1114
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,560
person's opinion you don't tell them

1115
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:10,830
they're wrong if you're wrong admit it

1116
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:14,190
be empathetic about it beginneth from

1117
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:16,710
the way gimm saying yes let them do the

1118
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:19,260
talking let them feel like the ideas

1119
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,870
theirs try to honestly see things from

1120
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,780
their point of view be sympathetic to

1121
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:26,150
the other person's ideas and desires

1122
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:29,220
appeal to their nobler motives and

1123
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:32,250
dramatize your ideas and lastly throw

1124
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,439
down a challenge so with that I think

1125
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:38,780
I'm out of time we're not going to do

1126
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,780
the scenario but thank you guys

1127
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:44,590
you

1128
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,590
