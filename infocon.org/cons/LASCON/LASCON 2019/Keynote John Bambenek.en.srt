2
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,860
all right good morning

3
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,270
they said I wear a lot of hats and most

4
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
of these hats will actually work weave

5
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,650
themselves into this talk and hopefully

6
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,970
to a coherent narrative I'm vice

7
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,650
president of security research and

8
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,510
intelligence at a small security company

9
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,570
called threat stop I am working on my

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,970
PhD in machine learning or informatics

11
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,200
specifically but machine learning at the

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,390
University of Illinois as well as

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,780
lecturing and teaching which I've done

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:08,250
for the last seven years and I produce

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,570
open sourced threat feeds so I have an

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,310
agenda things that are covered to

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,809
hopefully go from the abstract to

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,390
hopefully some general and specific

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,119
takeaways that I think will hopefully be

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,630
useful for you as we talk about ethics

21
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,200
technology and data in some aspects of

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,670
security of really of data that we are

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,110
creating through web apps and mobile

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,210
apps and some of the technologies that

25
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,040
we may all be involved in of which the

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,500
implications of that data creation I

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,539
don't think are entirely well understood

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,100
or well thought through and how we

29
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:43,020
secure it is also important but the

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,178
start is you know I often you know get

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,459
asked I'm sure you know by others right

32
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:51,090
why haven't you fixed security yet like

33
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:54,030
why is hacking still a thing Oh wasp has

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,759
been around for about 15 years 10 years

35
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,280
right and sequel injections still happen

36
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,250
right why haven't these problems been

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,530
fixed and a lot of these problems have

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,709
real implications not just in terms of

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,869
data theft but in real world physical

40
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,940
risks a different part of my research

41
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,370
involves surveillance malware used by

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,560
the Chinese government on ethnic

43
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,480
minorities and Tibet's and all the

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,370
various groups inside PRC that you can

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,899
name that are targeted by the Chinese

46
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,330
government who are using mobile phones

47
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,280
and vulnerabilities and mobile phones to

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,950
track and ultimately put people in

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,599
concentration camps you know we haven't

50
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,839
really fixed those problems in terms to

51
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,390
how to figure out how to use securely a

52
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,099
technology securely but as a way to kind

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,980
of hopefully wake you up a little bit

54
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,130
what is the earliest documented case

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,399
that anybody in this room of can

56
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:50,840
think of a social engineering attack yes

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,070
Genesis chapter 3 right and no matter

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,040
what you happen to believe about that

59
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,370
book right not to make a religious point

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,310
but that pen was put to paper for that

61
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,210
book thirty four hundred years ago and

62
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,100
they were talking about social

63
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,740
engineering back then the point is all

64
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,650
of this stuff has been around in essence

65
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,290
as part of the human culture since the

66
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,030
beginning right after Adam and Eve what

67
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,040
did the next generation did you know

68
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,860
Cain and Abel right you know we went to

69
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,950
straight fratricide right in generation

70
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,780
two all of these problems that we face

71
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,220
in cybersecurity are really human

72
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,380
problems that we're trying to use

73
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,770
technology to solve why do people commit

74
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:34,370
crime the only thing that technology has

75
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:37,100
allowed them to do criminals is to

76
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,800
commit crime on an unprecedented scale

77
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,269
in over larger distances people have

78
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,370
been doing credit card and cheque fraud

79
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,590
ever since there were credit cards and

80
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,210
checks until the internet you just had

81
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,360
to physically expose yourself now you

82
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:53,390
can do it from Russia so we can't fix it

83
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,730
because we can't fix you know we can't

84
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,920
fix human beings I don't know how to if

85
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,410
I did I you know I don't know what it

86
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,100
would be do you know what I do with that

87
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:06,710
I do a lot of teaching right of

88
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,010
in University and community college

89
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:12,770
environments and and higher ed right we

90
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,709
do okay teaching people concepts but we

91
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,630
don't do a well very well job of

92
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,480
teaching curiosity which is really what

93
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,360
is important for security and fixing

94
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,630
things and finding vulnerabilities so

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,470
here is a thought exercise what is the

96
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:36,170
neatest IOT embedded whatever gadget

97
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:38,690
that somebody in this room owns surely

98
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:42,590
somebody has some kind of you know smart

99
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:46,090
meter or something sir and Alexa all

100
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,799
right everybody knows what an Alexa is

101
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,359
now can I have a volunteer somebody who

102
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,930
has an idea of how to kill somebody with

103
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,930
an Alexa

104
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:06,558
that's a good point right if Alexis tied

105
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,808
into a smart home right disrupting

106
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:10,699
people's emergency communications right

107
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:13,159
that's a great example right

108
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,659
we had awkward silence but all of us in

109
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,659
this room are not normal right we're

110
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:20,419
dealing with misuses of Technology right

111
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:22,039
so we have biases but when I walk into a

112
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,558
college classroom and go through this

113
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,209
exercise with my students right and most

114
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:28,490
of my students are Chinese because of my

115
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:30,139
university they don't know how to parse

116
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,669
the question I'm asking all right if

117
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,860
you've ever seen like what it looks like

118
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:37,399
for a human mind to blue screen that's

119
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,379
usually the response that I get it's

120
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,029
actually and I couple years ago I

121
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,099
interviewed students for just a you know

122
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,449
a student job wore a nice suit whatever

123
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,449
and just put on a Burger King crown

124
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,889
didn't say anything about it the Asian

125
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,479
students could not parse what was

126
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,589
happening right I just had to take it

127
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,429
off because they were just completely

128
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:57,830
lost but this is not how normal people

129
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:59,208
think of technology right we do because

130
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,248
this is the world where and this is the

131
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:03,409
problem we're here to solve but when

132
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:05,990
people make these technologies they're

133
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:08,990
thinking oh with an Alexa right now I

134
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,180
can order stuff you know and just use my

135
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,469
voice I have an act on Alexa in my

136
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,779
office because I'll never have it in my

137
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:16,339
home and all it does is play Pandora I

138
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,808
really don't know what people get out of

139
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:19,309
this device because we're making

140
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:21,139
technology to do things to solve

141
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:24,349
problems people really don't have to

142
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,719
make money but nobody's as these

143
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:28,729
technologies are created saying hey what

144
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,769
are the consequences of that what data

145
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:36,139
is being collected how can that data be

146
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:37,669
accessed and misused the misuse of data

147
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,589
is particularly important to me

148
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:41,448
right informatics is a science of

149
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:43,969
information right specifically I do

150
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:46,069
machine learning a couple of weeks ago I

151
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:47,899
did my PhD call exam you know where I've

152
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,909
got my committee they're asking me a

153
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:52,699
bunch of questions and one of the

154
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:54,199
questions was this one right rough I

155
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,059
don't know if it's an accurate quote but

156
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,490
the essence of the question is right in

157
00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:00,529
the context of the Hong Kong protests

158
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,139
how would you address adversarial

159
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:04,669
machine learning and facial recognition

160
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,770
so I don't know if people know if those

161
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,840
terms are but adversarial machine learn

162
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,630
is basically subset of machine learning

163
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,508
of how you do machine learning safely

164
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,639
off of untrusted inputs it's an academic

165
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,750
gussied up way of saying input

166
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:24,710
validation but we use just various image

167
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:27,319
transforms to make a3 be processed as a4

168
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,150
or whatever so how do you solve that

169
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,889
problem and in Hong Kong we have a live

170
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,799
world way of doing it in academic

171
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,139
literature we've never there's never

172
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,150
been an attack in the real world until

173
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,650
Hong Kong on image recognition systems

174
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,750
their facial recognition systems we've

175
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:45,500
used Gaussian transforms and all this

176
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,990
nice pretty little math but ultimately

177
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,620
right if you think about it we're still

178
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,169
solving the same problem that was

179
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,819
written about 23 years ago and smashing

180
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,430
the stack with for fun and profit which

181
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:00,530
is basically buffer overflows is how do

182
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,930
you do computing safely on untrusted

183
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,940
inputs and we're really not anywhere

184
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,530
farther on solving that problem we have

185
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,990
lots of complexity some things we put on

186
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,719
top of it but that's also the problem of

187
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,000
web security right sequel injection XSS

188
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:15,949
you know all the web vulnerabilities you

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,449
can think ultimately come down to input

190
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:22,430
validation problems or untrusted inputs

191
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,789
so how bad is facial recognition or

192
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:32,149
litter image recognition what number is

193
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:33,370
on the slide no it's it's it actually is

194
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:38,979
3 we're not there yet

195
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,979
soon decaf slow down

196
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,080
there's what's called an M NIST data set

197
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,459
right which is just a pretty acronym

198
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,510
which it doesn't really matter what the

199
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,540
acronym stands for

200
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,790
it's just handwritten numerals of zero

201
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,449
through nine and getting a system a

202
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,130
computer to recognize what number it is

203
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,680
three four seven right the number of

204
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,560
classes is fairly simple so simple right

205
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,459
zero through nine nothing overly

206
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,670
complicated how accurate do you think

207
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:12,989
machine learning is on untrusted inputs

208
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:20,140
to recognize that correctly

209
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:24,279
percentage-wise wow you're all dark and

210
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:27,970
cynical it's not that bad for this data

211
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,610
set right there's this exercise right of

212
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,410
white box and black box testing of

213
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,110
machine learning algorithms and we get

214
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,089
up to two ninety six percent off of

215
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,600
artificially generated adversarial

216
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:43,089
examples right think about that one in

217
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,420
twenty five chance that a three gets

218
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:48,370
recognized as a seven and everybody is

219
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,890
throwing machine learning and AI into

220
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,550
everything and we can't figure out

221
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:59,079
Decimus just one decimal what could go

222
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:00,790
wrong right oh I don't know the biggest

223
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,770
use case I can think of of image

224
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,270
recognition is self-driving cars right a

225
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,760
car has to figure out what's around it

226
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,680
well you've only got a one a twenty five

227
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,410
chance of hey that pedestrian is really

228
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,410
a crosswalk oops

229
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,750
right we're creating technology that

230
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,149
that really the biggest loss is an

231
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,550
information it's life and safety

232
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:26,649
we're the best we can do is maybe

233
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:28,420
ninety-six percent to go back to our

234
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:30,190
example right image recognition or

235
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,380
facial recognition Hong Kong protests

236
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,060
I'm sure some of you seen the news there

237
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,189
use of laser pointers pointed at the

238
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,959
cameras people are putting faces they

239
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,510
got this little hologram stuff they put

240
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,790
on in front of their face all sorts of

241
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:46,779
real-world examples to mess with image

242
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:49,420
recognition systems right but assuming

243
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,160
you know that's done in in ways that the

244
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,990
system can handle it's a one or twenty

245
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,230
five chance that you throw the wrong

246
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,060
person in a concentration camp

247
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,279
that's the stakes of some of the systems

248
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,619
that we're creating today right and some

249
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,220
of those I mean Facebook is doing image

250
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,350
recognition

251
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,890
I don't think Facebook is feeding into

252
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,050
what's going on in Hong Kong yet but

253
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,339
that's the world we live in right and

254
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:18,029
we're adopting this technology anyway my

255
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,170
entire career in information security is

256
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:22,300
consisted of me saying hey you know what

257
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,170
this is a bad idea and you ought not to

258
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,490
do that

259
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,990
and people doing it anyway so hey the

260
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,850
great news is it's good training for

261
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,920
Parenthood right I'm about to have

262
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,350
teenagers who are gonna ignore me so I

263
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,000
spend most of my time as a father and

264
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,150
I'm gonna say this to my ten-year-old

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,540
son what you know when daddy says what

266
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:47,380
happens when you play stupid games you

267
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,969
win stupid prizes right that's about 12

268
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,620
years of fatherhood from you know to be

269
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,030
fair you know the toddler years I don't

270
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,090
say that too much they're just toddlers

271
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,910
but you get the point people are doing

272
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,170
things they ought not to be doing and

273
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,650
it's just not how we deal with data

274
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,150
that's changing right how we're dealing

275
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,130
with media and lots of other problems

276
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,550
right you know here's something I just

277
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,860
saw yesterday is that Newsweek uh you

278
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,770
know Newsweek was an established and

279
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,660
reputable media company back in the day

280
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,340
and this was a reporter saying you know

281
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,510
what our compensation was tied directly

282
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:25,630
to clicks which radically skews how we

283
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,830
do news I don't know what the political

284
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,450
balance of this room is and what you

285
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,180
feel about the media but the way

286
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,550
everything is reported now is basically

287
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,560
an influence operation I had the

288
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,030
influences clicks and whatever to make

289
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,489
you outraged or angry so you keep

290
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:41,980
clicking and keep reading but we are

291
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,310
radically changing all sorts of things

292
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,920
downstream because of social media and

293
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,239
lights right because now the number of

294
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,089
likes you have and the number of

295
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,430
retweets you have is a leaderboard that

296
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,310
now people are getting compensated on

297
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,050
which radically skews things but as you

298
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,839
know as people who've done security for

299
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,900
a while anything that is algorithmically

300
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,620
generated can and will be of algorithmic

301
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,689
ly manipulated that's life right what's

302
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,490
SEO or blackhat SEO

303
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,480
it's just manipulating search engines

304
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,980
because if you're not on the first page

305
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,500
of a Google search you just don't matter

306
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,420
so this is an entire industry we've

307
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,350
created to manipulate algorithms just in

308
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:26,110
search engines but to go back to my

309
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,090
point right what would you do in the

310
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,760
context of the Hong Kong protests to fix

311
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,860
the machine learning and facial

312
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,930
recognition I don't know if it was a

313
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,350
response my thesis committee was looking

314
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,719
for but my answer is I wouldn't I'm not

315
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,850
going to create technology that's going

316
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,710
to enable people to be thrown in prison

317
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,999
because they don't like what their

318
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,769
government is doing period full stop

319
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:55,889
kicked me out of my ph.d program if you

320
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:58,049
don't like right now the benefit is no

321
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:59,669
you clap right as if this is a

322
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:01,769
courageous stand it's really not right I

323
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:04,228
don't need the PhD kick me out whatever

324
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,299
right I'm getting the PhD to troll my

325
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:10,499
university it's being powered by

326
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:13,228
contempt and rage right you know yeah

327
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:15,419
I'm a lecturer they pay me 12,500 I

328
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:17,789
think we all know the median salary of

329
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,220
what we do in this room twelve five is

330
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,749
like my beer money it's money I can

331
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,269
spend that I don't have to tell my wife

332
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:26,579
about on stuff that I like right I mean

333
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:28,019
it affects me but really I'm going to

334
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,309
eat at the end of the day but when you

335
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:33,989
start your career you don't have that

336
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:36,089
luxury right but I think our primary

337
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:37,379
duty right I mean it's a rhetorical

338
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,569
question because you already know what

339
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:41,759
my answer is right is our primary duty

340
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:46,589
to our employers or to the world around

341
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:49,319
us we are not normal right is that we

342
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,999
have skills to help defend against

343
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,618
problems that we don't even really know

344
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:56,129
exist yet or at least the world around

345
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:57,899
us don't know exist yet and we all make

346
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,569
good money right getting into this

347
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,429
industry is you know a meal ticket to an

348
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,748
upper middle class life forever right

349
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:05,459
there's more problems than there are

350
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:08,220
people to solve them we're going to be

351
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:10,138
employed forever I'm not gonna retire I

352
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,109
don't have to retire right I can work

353
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:14,819
until I'm 80 having six kids by the time

354
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:15,989
the six kid is out of college I'm gonna

355
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:18,269
retire because I don't want to do crap

356
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:19,829
for nobody after that but I don't have

357
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:23,429
to retire I can keep working there'll

358
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:26,189
always be work but we have skills that

359
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:28,199
can help the world around us because if

360
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:30,748
we're just looking at our employers or

361
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,758
the web apps that they create we're

362
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:35,669
really talking about a small sliver of

363
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,519
the problem right of just enterprise

364
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:40,919
security basically but most of society

365
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,289
is not protected by security teams or

366
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,478
security tools or the things that we

367
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:48,720
create their whole genres of threats

368
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:50,970
that are directly b2c only as an example

369
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,399
of this I don't know if anybody in the

370
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,349
expo room has this swag it's my favorite

371
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,409
piece of swag because it shows how much

372
00:15:55,349 --> 00:16:01,050
we suck how many people have that little

373
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:03,030
slider in front of their webcam

374
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,630
it's more than that you can rape you can

375
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:08,970
all raise your embrace your shame people

376
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,680
right we're professionals our job is to

377
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,990
secure stuff and what do we tell people

378
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,910
about creeping on other people's webcams

379
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,480
put this little slider in front of your

380
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:21,750
webcam James Comey at one point the

381
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,100
director of the FBI got on TV and said

382
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,830
well you know what I put this little

383
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,650
slider in front of my webcam you're the

384
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:32,850
director of the damn FBI and we can't

385
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:35,370
protect your webcam we're nowhere on

386
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,500
solving this problem right here's a

387
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:42,540
little piece of plastic to just pretend

388
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:44,940
that the problem doesn't exist does this

389
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,980
have to do with web apps right you know

390
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,630
machine learning is just a subset of

391
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,390
data science as many of you know data

392
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,270
science is huge I think data science is

393
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,949
huge because we've created Web Apps we

394
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,350
created mobile apps or just another form

395
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,870
of web apps that generate tons of

396
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,670
information about us most of the people

397
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,750
who design these systems just want all

398
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,950
the information they don't know what

399
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,839
they're gonna do with it they don't know

400
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,130
what their use of it is just give me all

401
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,280
the information we'll figure it out

402
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,500
later now we've got this stock pile of

403
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,589
data on humanity that would have been

404
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,230
impossible to figure out even a small

405
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,579
scale 20 years ago let's figure out ways

406
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,550
to make money so we're gonna hire data

407
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,319
scientists to do data mining we're gonna

408
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,750
do machine learning to say oh people who

409
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,030
tweet about this you know we probably

410
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,910
ought to give them web advertisements of

411
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,470
these products and these services but

412
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,740
there's all sorts of risks just having

413
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,990
you know that data sitting around right

414
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,060
we talked about OAuth in terms of on the

415
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,700
front end right preventing malicious

416
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,020
access to that but on the back end

417
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,210
there's plenty of ways to access the

418
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,430
data what do you think Facebook's going

419
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,990
to do when they get in a National

420
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:56,010
Security Letter they're going to give up

421
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:58,320
the data as one example it's a cloud

422
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,480
service not a web app but I come from a

423
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,550
family of lawyers and judges and petty

424
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,080
criminals which is what makes me great

425
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,570
in security I can find a loophole in

426
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,429
anything but you know there's some

427
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,889
voice-over-ip company that goes to my

428
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,269
family's law firm says hey we can do all

429
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,219
your voice over IP or

430
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:16,919
voicemails will be in the cloud all this

431
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:18,149
study it'll be great it'll be cheap they

432
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,589
call me it says what do you what do you

433
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:22,830
think about this I think this is a

434
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:25,769
profoundly stupid idea because at the

435
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:28,019
end of the day every call that you get

436
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:31,469
as a lawyer is attorney-client

437
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:32,820
privileged it is the most privileged in

438
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:35,129
the Western world anyway it's the

439
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,259
highest class it's enviable except in

440
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:40,019
very narrow circumstances you just

441
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,399
cannot break that so cloud company what

442
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,779
happens when you get a National Security

443
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:46,949
Letter wanting to know my my uncle's

444
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,599
voicemails who's a lawyer his

445
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,999
communication between his clients

446
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,889
well we comply with legal process wrong

447
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:55,200
answer and that is why we're not going

448
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:56,820
to put it in the cloud but we're

449
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,659
adopting these services and I got an

450
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,950
example on you know the slide here right

451
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:04,529
what happens if you email your doctor

452
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,690
your therapist talking about anxiety and

453
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:08,070
depression right that happens we should

454
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,109
take care of our mental health you're

455
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,879
going to have that kind of communication

456
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:13,769
well now all the algorithms they may not

457
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:16,559
mine your therapist but they're minding

458
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:19,619
you and now you get has anxiety disorder

459
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,529
label on your gmail account even though

460
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:23,579
it's HIPAA protected information

461
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:27,839
congratulations we found a loophole in

462
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:29,999
HIPAA the data can be stolen it can

463
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,829
categorize us people have been talking

464
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:33,359
about China's social credit score if you

465
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:35,158
behave in ways that the Chinese

466
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,509
government doesn't like well all the

467
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,779
sudden you don't get to ride on trains

468
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:42,690
and fly on planes anymore okay well that

469
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:45,539
wouldn't ever happen here except well it

470
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,029
does because hey do you want a 20%

471
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,408
discount on your auto insurance install

472
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,909
this app on your phone that pays

473
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,859
attention to where you drive and how

474
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:55,079
fast you drive and all that information

475
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,820
is now available right insurance

476
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,440
companies like the social credit score

477
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,269
concept because it allows their

478
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,489
actuaries to give discounts to good

479
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:05,070
people and not discounts to people that

480
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:07,229
they don't like but it also allows for

481
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,749
some interesting you know avenues of

482
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:13,620
trolling one of my favorite hobbies in

483
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:16,230
the world is harassing politicians

484
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,668
not I don't harass any of them right you

485
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,529
know in order for this to happen they

486
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:23,279
have to deserve it in some way right

487
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:25,289
they're just bad people and eight years

488
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,970
ago had a conversation with a state

489
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:29,490
rapper right

490
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,230
it was redistricting you know he

491
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,360
promised to move into his new district

492
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,669
his wife didn't want to move so he

493
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,049
didn't so he decided to transfer his

494
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:41,309
voter registration to a hotel room I

495
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:43,168
don't know why that made sense to him

496
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,850
because the way they do it in Chicago I

497
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,809
also grew up in the Chicago suburbs from

498
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,879
a political family

499
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,158
I know Chicago politics because I lived

500
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,929
it for 20 years right how they do it in

501
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,460
Chicago is you just rent some apartment

502
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:55,470
somewhere you're getting 270 thousand a

503
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,450
year salary you get a $300 a month

504
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,590
flophouse in order to figure out if

505
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,500
you're actually there you got to put a

506
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:04,770
guy on the room watch it well this clown

507
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,360
with a functional IQ of 40 does a hotel

508
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,158
room which has patent BS to begin with

509
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,408
then the conversation goes something

510
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,820
like this

511
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,590
representative did you think about what

512
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,189
you did before you did it were you

513
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,980
talking about

514
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,529
that hotel room when you got it does it

515
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,870
have a little remote keycard well yeah

516
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,539
so you put it to the door to open it up

517
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,330
yeah well that means instead of having

518
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:28,890
to monitor the door I just send a legal

519
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,809
request to the hotel operator

520
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,260
how many times did your key open that

521
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:37,980
door representative is that number zero

522
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:41,760
yeah congratulations there's your first

523
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,100
felony that hotel operator also runs

524
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,080
nursing homes that get state funding

525
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,110
yeah that means you got a free hotel

526
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,870
room from a state vendor that's your

527
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,760
second and third felony would you like

528
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,949
to go to prison or would you like door

529
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,919
number two to just rage quit your office

530
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:03,960
he chose door number two I particularly

531
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:06,480
like the ragequit that's my favorite we

532
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,600
can't secure information right we can

533
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,059
try we can mitigate the risks right but

534
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,500
even if your web app is secure right you

535
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,418
can't deal with the malicious insider

536
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,090
problem very easily we haven't found a

537
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,710
good way to it about a month ago there

538
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,780
was a yahoo employee who was trolling

539
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,730
all the images people upload to Yahoo

540
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,750
looking for less than closed pictures of

541
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,520
women he went to prison

542
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,960
but I assure you there's more people at

543
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,090
Yahoo they were doing that he just got

544
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,500
caught right people with otherwise legal

545
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,810
access that are not behaving in

546
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,270
appropriate ways let's call them

547
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:43,540
intelligence agencies for short they get

548
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:45,670
information all the time right in China

549
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,310
they're all state-owned companies they

550
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,170
just ask in the United States well we

551
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,669
have due process that due process has

552
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,700
send a national security letter and they

553
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:56,500
get the information right so we create

554
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,510
all of these tools that have risks right

555
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,940
we may look at the risks on the front

556
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,550
end with web vulnerabilities but what

557
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,960
are the implications of that right now

558
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,940
of course when you start telling your

559
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,760
employer's no they tend to not like that

560
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,520
right I'm sure some of you have run into

561
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,920
this this is a bad idea right or better

562
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,660
yet I'm sure many of you do penetration

563
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,410
testing or vulnerability assessment in

564
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:22,810
this room how many of you do that now

565
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,360
how many of you having done that have

566
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,800
run to a client or your company who said

567
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,090
I'm not going to fix that vulnerability

568
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,360
because that would never happen in the

569
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,580
real world I'm pretty sure that's almost

570
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,580
every hand that was up for both right

571
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,960
now if you've done this you know

572
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,730
commercially right you know or or

573
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,470
internally right the most important

574
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,480
document you have right the tool that

575
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,910
says okay I mean you can make that

576
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,320
choice I think it's a bad choice you

577
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,960
just signed this risk acceptance

578
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,870
document because that means when it all

579
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,530
blows up that I'm not the one holding

580
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:59,280
the bag you accepted the risk that also

581
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,690
comes with consequences but that's okay

582
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,639
you just can't sit on top of the server

583
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,200
room yelling stop or whatever the

584
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,790
there's an old poem that has something

585
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,760
about that yelling on top of the hill

586
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,030
yelling stop we can't do that but how do

587
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,379
you secure the unsecure right

588
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,420
because the reality is it's all

589
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,540
defective duct tape and bubble gum right

590
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,910
you think web app security failure to

591
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,030
handle this character breaks all sorts

592
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:28,480
of things right the single quote just

593
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,490
one character out of 255 right there

594
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,170
there's your sequel injection problem of

595
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,340
course it's all web security is more

596
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,240
complicated than that

597
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:40,178
but the compromises are relatively

598
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,340
simple and we're just skipping past that

599
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,809
you'd compromise people trivially we'll

600
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,019
just skip past that problem because I

601
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:51,129
can't fix humanity right I can barely

602
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:54,129
fix technology right but these simple

603
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:57,759
vulnerabilities also allow us some

604
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:59,110
simple tools from time to time to do bad

605
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,539
things to bad people

606
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:05,830
or at least keep tabs on them help them

607
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:09,580
get put in prison every now and then as

608
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:11,499
an example in 2016 right the russians

609
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,490
hacked the dnc the russians hacked the

610
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:14,590
Democratic Congressional Campaign

611
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,990
Committee they didn't know what to do

612
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:20,230
with the data they had so hey I got an

613
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:22,869
idea let's get on Twitter and created

614
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,059
this account booster for 2.0 the reason

615
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:27,189
that we know the three individuals who

616
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:29,470
are associated with that account with

617
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,529
the Russian GRU is because one time they

618
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,720
were obviously not doing this from the

619
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:37,269
home office they went to a coffee shop

620
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,369
or wherever off site and one time the

621
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:41,950
VPN wasn't down I'm sure many of you

622
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:43,720
have personal VPNs these things fail

623
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,980
silently and now all of a sudden your IP

624
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,289
address is exposed oops there's Russian

625
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,330
intelligence you think they know better

626
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:54,850
but they're using tools that happen to

627
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,090
fail quietly and now we know who they

628
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,248
are

629
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,240
and they're under indictment but it's

630
00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:00,580
not like they're ever gonna come to the

631
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,960
US anyway right they made a relatively

632
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,970
simple mistake that allowed us to

633
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,789
enumerate them there's lots of

634
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,830
interesting other use cases right I love

635
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:11,139
Bitcoin right one of my hobby projects

636
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,629
is tracking neo-nazi fundraising the

637
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:15,309
reason I love Bitcoin is because it

638
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:17,399
allows me to follow financial

639
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:20,230
transactions without bribing bankers

640
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:23,320
right intelligence isn't my job title it

641
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,090
is what I do because bitcoin is

642
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,799
anonymous right you gather you know the

643
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,360
alphanumeric strings this is your wallet

644
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,039
right but all the transactions are

645
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,289
public because how do you know that

646
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,080
money has changed hands when there isn't

647
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:36,429
a central authority well all the nodes

648
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,740
have to see it and if they have

649
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:43,210
consensus then the transaction happened

650
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:45,100
it has to be public by design okay there

651
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,480
is so-called perfect use of Bitcoin but

652
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,490
you

653
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,890
the perfect use of Bitcoin is unusable

654
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,390
people want to transact money which

655
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,610
means they've got to let people know who

656
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,550
their wallet is which means anonymity

657
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:59,429
breaks right privacy is not even part of

658
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,620
the use case if you openly ask for

659
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:04,230
donations then it's obvious who you are

660
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,449
right daily stormer is not exactly a

661
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,340
wholesome individual right you know when

662
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,410
I say neo-nazis this guy has swastikas

663
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,480
on his website right this is not hey

664
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,180
he's conservative I mean straight-up

665
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,060
hates the Jews all all the way down no

666
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:20,250
ambiguity there's Bitcoin wallets on his

667
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,080
website all I got to do is go to an API

668
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,120
and now it's every time that he raised

669
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,929
his money he only got four dollars since

670
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,340
the last transaction but he's raised

671
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,830
depending on the value of Bitcoin about

672
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,980
a half million maybe a little bit more

673
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:37,439
and by the way as just a random aside

674
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,320
most of the mass shootings in the United

675
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,960
States and the unfortunate one in the

676
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,570
Christchurch Moscone nutri in in

677
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:50,190
Christchurch in New Zealand are tied to

678
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:51,780
his organization right so fairly

679
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,940
interesting individual but he operates

680
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:57,980
openly enough to where I can track his

681
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,980
money and he has real well real wealth

682
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:04,340
you can also do things like surveil

683
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:07,860
miscreants almost everything uses DNS

684
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,570
I'm gonna say DNS is life but as far as

685
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,790
the Internet is concerned it is right

686
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,980
without DNS there is no internet and

687
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,780
almost everything uses it so if

688
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,240
attackers want to reach victims or vice

689
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,550
versa they can't really play games with

690
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,800
DNS right there are host names need to

691
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,990
resolve which means I can go figure out

692
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,669
where they're resolving to and track all

693
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:30,720
of their infrastructure at least their

694
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:33,240
proxies than the first the first layer

695
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,210
of their network which means I can also

696
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,500
put those IP addresses into firewalls

697
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,360
nobody really thinks about firewalls

698
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,640
right this device oh I got a firewall i

699
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,429
plug it into the network I allow port 80

700
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,950
in port 443 you can also use that to

701
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,000
just block known bad stuff right and you

702
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,640
don't have to worry about that we'll

703
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,530
come to that point in a little bit Dhar

704
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,500
some caveats about deception an

705
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:58,350
attackers lie that you can handle you

706
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,720
know it also this kind of surveillance

707
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,070
says enable the predatory business model

708
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,860
where they register malicious domain

709
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,659
names and then see an IP address from a

710
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,059
company connect to it and then they get

711
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,559
a call from a sales associate it hey you

712
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,600
got breached I got the evidence right

713
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,510
here here's my invoice to help you clean

714
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,620
it up you know so we're also enabling

715
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:21,809
that vendor tactics but such as humanity

716
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:24,418
but it's easy to do is the point is that

717
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:27,330
often in security we create the

718
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:30,150
complicated solutions first and skip

719
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:32,039
past the simple ones which means we're

720
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,409
awfully inefficient in what we do right

721
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:37,530
limit amount of time budget and people

722
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:39,750
right start with a simple block as much

723
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,270
as you can and go from there because big

724
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,710
enterprises have big budgets I'm going

725
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,090
to guess most of the people in this room

726
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,429
are associated with small and medium

727
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,289
business and you're not going to be able

728
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:51,330
to I mean you'll get Splunk you might

729
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,610
get a security tool but you're not gonna

730
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,230
put a bunch of fireEye boxes in and a

731
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,250
bunch of Palo Alto this and a bunch of

732
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,440
this because you just don't have the

733
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,870
budget for it we create our security

734
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,870
tools for enterprises and we hope that

735
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,219
the people in smaller medium business do

736
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:09,020
what they can right there aren't that

737
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,020
many companies out there for that market

738
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,970
so I took that method right using this

739
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,860
one little line which is the guts of a

740
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,429
bunch of shell scripts to say I've got a

741
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:22,320
bunch of malicious domains about 900,000

742
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:24,120
whitelisting clean it up I'm writing

743
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,879
this little little shell script to just

744
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:31,049
turn those in IP addresses and turn it

745
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,150
into a business right not that I'm

746
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:36,480
trying to sell it but the point is is

747
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:40,230
sometimes some of our security problems

748
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,530
can be solved greatly not completely by

749
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:47,340
simple things right like using parallel

750
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:50,340
and asynchronous DNS queries right it's

751
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,980
not hard if somebody just has to do it

752
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,590
and sometimes I said me over complicate

753
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,600
things there's a notion of imposter

754
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,309
syndrome right which I'm sure some

755
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,750
people in this room know you know but

756
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:02,039
basically it's the notion of you know

757
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,809
what I'm not smart enough I'm not good

758
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,250
enough I can't I can't get on a stage

759
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:06,899
and give a talk I'm sure many of you

760
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,050
have not given a talk at a conference

761
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:12,170
are perfectly qualified to give a

762
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:14,149
we think of the problems as way too

763
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:17,390
complicated sometimes the solution is

764
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:19,430
relatively easy right DNS queries are

765
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,590
not hard right I've solved lots of

766
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,480
problems simply by just saying you know

767
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,840
what I can figure this out simply by

768
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,760
just doing advanced counting and math

769
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,370
all of us can do this but we're

770
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,170
pre-wired for whatever reason to think

771
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:37,250
of the problems more complicated than

772
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:39,050
they really are so start with a simple

773
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:42,080
and then leave the complex for last

774
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:43,909
because there's only so much so much

775
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,399
time so many people and so many

776
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,320
resources right especially if you're a

777
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,320
smaller company right and you should

778
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,080
always start with people if you have

779
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,970
employees that are resistant to clicking

780
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,620
on phishing links you have a lot less to

781
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,880
worry about that problem going back to

782
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,939
the human element you're never going to

783
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,470
solve social engineering but you can

784
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,540
make people a little bit more resistant

785
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,280
to it so let's take the example of

786
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,510
business email compromise right not a

787
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,760
web vulnerability primarily it's I'm

788
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:16,220
basically social engineering the CEO or

789
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:21,260
CFO or the accountant or whoever to wire

790
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,660
money my boss might see I report to a

791
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,610
CEO he gets us about once a month while

792
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:28,100
he doesn't people in the company get it

793
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,629
they get an email spoof from him the

794
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,429
email doesn't look like it's anything

795
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:33,050
close to him but it says his name hey I

796
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,540
need you to wire this money I need to

797
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,310
get back in contact with me ASAP people

798
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,560
are afraid of the CEO so they do

799
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:42,740
whatever he says instead of picking up a

800
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:47,149
phone how many people have bought or

801
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:49,730
sold a house about everybody how many of

802
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:55,400
you did that transaction exclusively

803
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:57,650
over email fine I said we're not normal

804
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,030
I had this conversation because I bought

805
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,560
a new house two years ago the bank's

806
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:04,550
like yeah I'd like your tax returns can

807
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:08,690
you email them to me no you're a bank

808
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:11,060
and this is a $300,000 transaction right

809
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,370
this is your a business email compromise

810
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,950
that are just compromising that low-rent

811
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:18,169
compromises of real estate lawyers and

812
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,390
title companies just doing low-rent

813
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,470
tricks no malware involved it's all

814
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,480
social engineering

815
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,850
it's a billion-dollar business and by

816
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,710
the way if your money gets wired

817
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,379
someplace else for a down payment on a

818
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,820
house you can't just say hey that wasn't

819
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,860
me and and it all goes away

820
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,450
you know somebody is going to eat that

821
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,370
loss it's not like credit card fraud

822
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,350
there are people that I've worked with

823
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:42,469
who have lost their life savings over

824
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,809
this because we can't secure information

825
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,309
email is insecure and it's insecure

826
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:49,520
there is nothing I can give you for an

827
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:52,399
email we have PGP how many people have

828
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,280
installed or GPG now how many people

829
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,590
have used a few people of the people

830
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,340
keep your hands up who have GPG

831
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,939
installed

832
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:08,719
how many sent just one email a day

833
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:11,540
that's encrypted right here's the best

834
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,819
part I didn't notice this until I was I

835
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,590
was teaching the CISSP class where

836
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,020
somebody sit there and shows screenshots

837
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,899
of what gbg looks like or actually what

838
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,840
PGP looked like in the 90s the interface

839
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:25,549
is still the same it literally hasn't

840
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,649
changed in 20 years everything else

841
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,330
about technology has changed email

842
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:32,210
encryption is here's this complicated

843
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,830
unusable thing that us normal people and

844
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,849
there were abnormal people in the room

845
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:39,589
don't want to use because it sucks well

846
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:43,550
just send your tax returns over email

847
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:45,799
it's all good it's not all good patching

848
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,450
the password security go a long way but

849
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,820
the third data points the most important

850
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:52,069
every time I do an audit of a small to

851
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,599
medium business you know I ask a

852
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,970
question right do you really need to

853
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,339
keep that information is that really

854
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:01,450
essential that you have health records

855
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:03,799
for ten years can you just shred that

856
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,240
you know do you really need to keep that

857
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,900
class of information and store it in the

858
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,509
first place

859
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,730
you know because you can't steal what's

860
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,170
not there people over collect

861
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,380
information and they keep it forever

862
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:18,530
right how many people had prune their

863
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,780
email folders how many people you know

864
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,230
or I said the flipside how many people

865
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,480
keep email forever

866
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:29,450
almost everybody right nobody goes back

867
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,440
and deletes it here's a fun anecdote

868
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:36,379
because I teach digital forensics also

869
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:41,260
how old does email have to be until I

870
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:43,730
can get it without a warrant 180 days

871
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,760
because then it's considered discarded

872
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,200
content unless it's on my server right

873
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,240
if you store it on a third-party

874
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,069
provider and it's over 180 days and

875
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,529
there's no under indication that you're

876
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,060
trying to keep it or preserve it you can

877
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,850
get it with just an administrator an

878
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,500
administrative warrant which means just

879
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,710
signed by some special agent in charge

880
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,380
of the FBI right you lose all your

881
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,210
protection of that right so why would

882
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,550
you keep data that long right for

883
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,500
folders for email servers that I don't

884
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,750
have to preserve I just have things

885
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,300
automatically delete after 150 days

886
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:19,640
unless I start how many people have gone

887
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,250
back to an email two years ago or three

888
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,660
years ago

889
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,330
occasionally how often do you do it once

890
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,649
a month once a quarter every now and

891
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,600
then it happens every now and then I

892
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,820
mean convene so I wish I had that email

893
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:35,360
from two years ago but it's really not

894
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,610
that big of a problem right use things

895
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,190
you already have

896
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:42,890
we like layering more product on top of

897
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,200
security right oh here here's another

898
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,730
appliance and another appliance and

899
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,370
another appliance hey that 24-port

900
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,230
switch can you make 22 of them span

901
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:54,710
ports so all these things can inspect

902
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:56,540
traffic but you have lots of things that

903
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,220
can already protect things and will the

904
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,380
firewalls are one right we'll talk about

905
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,669
another in a minute start with the

906
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,040
simple stuff and stuff that you already

907
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:08,570
have and then see what's left right see

908
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:10,400
what the gaps are how many people think

909
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:16,640
antivirus is still effective raise your

910
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:18,850
hands one person all right - a lot of a

911
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,490
room of a couple hundred give or take

912
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:24,650
right how many people would say don't

913
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,979
install antivirus as a security control

914
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,720
just say skip it don't ever install it

915
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,420
nobody would do that why is this product

916
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,009
still the thing we professionals don't

917
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,280
have much love for it right

918
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:41,230
dart nurse says AV is dead why is it

919
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,230
still here any idea

920
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:48,910
and up you know I asked a roomful of

921
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:51,640
cynics this question and you just

922
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:55,149
reinforce my low faith in humanity you

923
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,230
glorious glorious people all of that is

924
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,190
true but it's not the point I'm trying

925
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:03,040
to make we still have it because it

926
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,990
still blocks 70% of nonsense

927
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,119
80 percent on what the percentage is

928
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:10,000
it's it's going down surely there's ways

929
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,290
around it yes but it just blocks things

930
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,880
and it just makes it go away

931
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:16,779
right hopefully it's blocking dark comet

932
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,570
which is still a thing

933
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,010
12 years later or whatever it's made but

934
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,940
things are just blocked and you don't

935
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,670
have to worry about it

936
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,380
right and focusing on things like that

937
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,869
it's simple it's easy it's cheap it

938
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:32,109
blocks some percentage of the threat

939
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:33,580
landscape all right because it's often I

940
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,150
said it's not sometimes simple things

941
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,650
get you

942
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:40,119
so I ran for office in 2012 I actually

943
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm starting to run for Congress now but

944
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,339
that's another story altogether

945
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,500
this happened a couple what day is today

946
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:48,730
hey this happened Tuesday Monday I know

947
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,220
the days blend together whatever

948
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:53,140
happened recently right we ran for

949
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,700
office in 2012 at one point I set up a

950
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,009
test WordPress site we're doing a

951
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:59,319
redesign whatever forgot about it

952
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,990
it's not linked anywhere this test dot

953
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,790
whatever right the main website was

954
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,439
converted to static HTML because I lost

955
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:08,650
the race so I just down the website

956
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,430
little H static HTML Thanks whatever I

957
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,630
saw him going back to work cool

958
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,730
completely forgot about it right I just

959
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,530
assumed it was online unlinked so was no

960
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,349
longer live somebody found it two three

961
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,210
days ago right a scanner popped it and

962
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:23,589
tried to run an IRC BOTS on it some

963
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,060
other defenses that I had on the server

964
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:26,950
caught it which is how is like you know

965
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,810
let's go take a look at that that says

966
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:32,049
oh somebody's turning on IRC BOTS on my

967
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,400
server that's bad right but I'm a

968
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,380
professional right I shouldn't make

969
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,180
these mistakes well it's pretty easy to

970
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,580
make these mistakes this stuff I don't

971
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,049
have an IT department it's a test site I

972
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,380
forgot about because the main site was

973
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:46,990
already down but these things happen

974
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:50,920
right and that happens an awful lot

975
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:52,720
because of DevOps and cloud deployment

976
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,040
you've got a developer saying I need to

977
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,419
make something so I'm going to spin up a

978
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,150
bunch of

979
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:02,010
in AWS with test data ha we don't know

980
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:05,670
how to generate test data so we use live

981
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:07,680
data maybe it's you know we'll we'll

982
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,970
just swap first names and last names of

983
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,450
people but all the other data is still

984
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:14,160
there so it's test date it's not valid

985
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,839
and here we are right and I figure out

986
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,308
which bank it was where they found some

987
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,210
tens of millions of credit card

988
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:22,619
applications on an unsecured s3 bucket

989
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,480
it say oh you're a big bank you

990
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,880
shouldn't have unsecured s3 buckets well

991
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,309
when you give your developers access to

992
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,849
AWS and there's no control around it you

993
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:37,619
really can't stop that problem right oh

994
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:40,230
but there's data loss prevention ha okay

995
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:44,369
how many people actually believe in DLP

996
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:47,790
that DLP works you're professionals a

997
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:52,880
couple of people you have way too much

998
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:52,880
hope sir give me time I will break you

999
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:03,240
yeah it's a band-aid on a bullet wound I

1000
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,130
think I said it makes you feel better no

1001
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,209
not really

1002
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,410
does Brown look or help you feel better

1003
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:13,700
just brown liquor help you feel better

1004
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:13,700
let me play you the song of my people

1005
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:18,180
so as an anecdote of simple things that

1006
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:21,868
could work right how does DNS work all

1007
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,339
of you are familiar with DNS right you

1008
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:25,109
know you've got your root servers you've

1009
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:27,270
got your top-level domains you've got

1010
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:29,910
the authoritative nameservers and you've

1011
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:32,309
got your resolver that's mitigating all

1012
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,920
of that and trying to figure out how do

1013
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:36,960
I get to WWE Google calm because

1014
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,990
computers don't understand names they

1015
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,150
only understand ones and zeroes well if

1016
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:44,368
you control the resolver you control

1017
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,770
everything right and everybody has a

1018
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:48,630
resolver how many of your workplaces do

1019
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,089
not how many of you work in play

1020
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:55,440
workplaces that do not have your own DNS

1021
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:56,880
resolver right essentially nobody unless

1022
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,740
you work in a company of five people and

1023
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,059
then use your ISPs resolver and you

1024
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,430
shouldn't do that because your ISP

1025
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,410
probably wants your data and you might

1026
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,720
be tempted to go to qua dates you should

1027
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:09,250
because Google wants your date

1028
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,939
but you can block lots of stuff in DNS

1029
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,280
right

1030
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,470
there's response policy zones it's built

1031
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,270
into DNS you don't have to install

1032
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:19,060
anything it's already there all you have

1033
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,680
to do is tell it what to block right so

1034
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,210
instead of going to bad site comm they

1035
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,640
get something else either it doesn't

1036
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:26,410
resolve it goes to a security awareness

1037
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,940
page whatever you want because

1038
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,399
everything that's bad on the internet

1039
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,290
often starts with DNS how do you secure

1040
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,950
these IOT devices does anyone work in a

1041
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:37,210
medical environment here nobody all

1042
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,640
right that's fair right

1043
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:43,170
there are tons of devices we're putting

1044
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,790
on networks that we cannot modify

1045
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:48,790
regulatorily speaking you cannot modify

1046
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:50,620
an MRI machine that includes putting a V

1047
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:52,990
on it endpoint CrowdStrike whatever you

1048
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,390
want to put you can't do it when you a

1049
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:56,649
patch comes out that's all sorts of

1050
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,629
problems with the FDA and

1051
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:01,600
recertification right we've got devices

1052
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,950
that we can't modify IOT devices it's

1053
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,680
basically a computer without an

1054
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,390
interface full built out operating

1055
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,390
system you could do anything you want on

1056
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:12,250
you know an IOT teddy bear because you

1057
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:15,609
know what humanity really needs is a

1058
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:17,830
teddy bear connected to the Internet but

1059
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,150
you know it's there it's communicating

1060
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,650
and as full operating system and you

1061
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:23,020
can't protect it but that teddy bear

1062
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,720
uses DNS which provides you something

1063
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:28,030
right you can detect on hostnames IP

1064
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:31,750
addresses the authoritative name server

1065
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:33,640
hostname and IP address right your turn

1066
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,080
in X domain you could log the query and

1067
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,180
let it happen many of you work in large

1068
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,640
organizations that are allergic to

1069
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,220
blocking things because oh there could

1070
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,690
be a false positive okay well then you

1071
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,390
could log at at least the sake knows

1072
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:49,270
somebody queried something bad and do a

1073
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:52,600
response to it you can move things to a

1074
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:54,670
walled garden it says hey you clicked on

1075
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,529
a link an email that was fishing and

1076
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,600
this is why you shouldn't do that the

1077
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,100
reason that that is important is that

1078
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,500
everything we know about security

1079
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,990
awareness training and the indicators

1080
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,240
that we give people of the padlocks and

1081
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,029
the warning messages of this sites not

1082
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:13,029
secure the academic literature says all

1083
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:15,520
of that crap don't work effectiveness

1084
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:18,520
near zero the only thing that does work

1085
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,269
is real-time feedback that they did

1086
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,799
something and

1087
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:22,569
immediately they got feedback you

1088
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:25,989
shouldn't have done this and that's why

1089
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:28,479
you can do that in DNS right in fact

1090
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:30,909
there's a couple of companies that exist

1091
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:32,649
their entire business model is to send

1092
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:34,659
phishing attacks to their clients and

1093
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:36,969
when people click on links they get

1094
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:40,239
awareness training this was your

1095
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:42,489
security vendor fish labs or whoever we

1096
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,719
tried to fish you and we succeeded this

1097
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:45,849
is what you should look for don't do

1098
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:48,989
that again that is very effective not

1099
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:51,249
not very effective more than zero

1100
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:52,709
statistically significant effectiveness

1101
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:55,029
right

1102
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:56,529
you knew similar with firewalls you've

1103
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:58,209
got these devices in your environments

1104
00:44:56,529 --> 00:45:01,049
how many of you work for companies that

1105
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:01,049
don't have a firewall

1106
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:06,939
everybody's got a firewall and these

1107
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:09,149
things have access control lists let's

1108
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:12,279
say you're a financial institution right

1109
00:45:09,149 --> 00:45:13,899
there's an O fact list of sanctioned

1110
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:16,779
countries thou shalt not do business

1111
00:45:13,899 --> 00:45:18,848
with they have entire net blocks you'll

1112
00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:22,390
put in your firewalls go block Eastern

1113
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:26,109
Europe right you not that Geographic

1114
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:27,638
blocking is great but you know banking

1115
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:29,769
fraud is pretty heavily correlated to

1116
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:33,939
Eastern Europe if you block that that

1117
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:37,598
space you block an awful lot you can

1118
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:40,089
also do this for web apps usually and

1119
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,130
going back to the campaign website the

1120
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:44,199
IP address that initially found the

1121
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,839
vulnerability and put a little PHP

1122
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:49,719
script on on the server was a different

1123
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:52,449
IP than was actually uploading the IRC

1124
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:55,539
BOTS whatever the automated tools the

1125
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:57,549
adversary uses and most of the

1126
00:45:55,539 --> 00:46:00,039
exploitation of web apps start with

1127
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:02,589
automated scanning come from

1128
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:04,299
infrastructure that's well-known right

1129
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:06,130
they scan everything they hit honey pots

1130
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:09,069
right there's companies that will sell

1131
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,509
you honeypot data great woohoo tell you

1132
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:11,889
what set up your own honey pots you get

1133
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:13,599
all sorts of intelligence you to block

1134
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:14,709
those IP addresses because nothing

1135
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,499
should ever talk to a honeypot

1136
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:18,549
that's not terribly exciting but if they

1137
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:20,888
don't know you're vulnerable in the

1138
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:23,829
first place then they don't come back

1139
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:26,079
it's not a hundred percent right 80

1140
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:29,469
percent whatever it goes away because

1141
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,059
the automated tools won't catch you so

1142
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:31,780
that people won't come back to do the

1143
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:33,370
interactive stuff

1144
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,690
now if you're specifically targeted

1145
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,180
they're gonna go to your website and

1146
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:39,610
figure it out but the scale of the

1147
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,250
vulnerable space of society is too large

1148
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:44,140
even for the attackers right they have

1149
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,030
just as much of a scale problem as we do

1150
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,730
right so we can use that to our

1151
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:51,370
advantage right it's not a hundred

1152
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:54,370
percent nothing's 100% got an unlimited

1153
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:56,500
budget I could probably get you to five

1154
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:57,910
nines all right anybody who says they

1155
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,350
offer you a hundred percent Security's

1156
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:01,089
full of crap don't buy their stuff

1157
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:03,730
because they're probably just running a

1158
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:05,500
Perl one-liner and you know and and

1159
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,390
selling you snake oil but you know that

1160
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,280
but if you get ninety percent for cheap

1161
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,870
right that's why a V is relevant you

1162
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,270
spend fifty dollars a year at block

1163
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,859
stuff it blocks stupid stuff that you

1164
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,030
don't have to deal with because you use

1165
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,220
this every now and then are gonna click

1166
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:20,500
on stupid stuff right you're gonna find

1167
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,299
minor mistakes everybody in here has

1168
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,950
probably developed a web app and there

1169
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,990
was a stupid mistake that got missed

1170
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:28,029
and so you hopefully your automated

1171
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,859
scanner found it or your red team found

1172
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:32,350
it or maybe the attacker found it

1173
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,490
this is all too complicated and way too

1174
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:37,020
easy to make a mistake

1175
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:40,779
but if you can at least limit the the

1176
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,759
threat landscape by 90% hey that's

1177
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,560
something yeah my might be the one that

1178
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,990
saves you how many people have heard

1179
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,290
that in 2016 election authorities got

1180
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:51,189
compromised right I live in the state

1181
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,140
where that happened

1182
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,760
state of Illinois we had an online voter

1183
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,200
registration system right so people

1184
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,360
could say oh I want to register to vote

1185
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,620
normally you could do that for the DMV

1186
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,800
or whatever they created an online

1187
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:05,680
system because it made sense now we have

1188
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,230
universal voter registration so I it's

1189
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,899
all kind of deprecated but online

1190
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,310
website right they found a sequel

1191
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,780
injection vulnerability because

1192
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,240
something was scanning the entire

1193
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,320
internet and found it the way the

1194
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,229
Illinois State Board of Elections

1195
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,820
noticed that I had a problem is that

1196
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,410
their web servers were being knocked

1197
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,880
down under high load and they took a

1198
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,770
look and found that somebody was

1199
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,560
basically brute-forcing the tables to

1200
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:31,840
find information it was not nearly as

1201
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,060
targeted as an attack as people think I

1202
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,470
actually disagree with the FBI I think

1203
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,029
it was a conventional cyber criminal

1204
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,890
that was doing it not Russian

1205
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,270
intelligence that person may have been

1206
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,819
flipping information to Russian

1207
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:44,530
intelligence because you know that they

1208
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,700
do like their tribute every now and then

1209
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,470
either you're gonna cut him in on your

1210
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,060
on your profits or you cut him in on

1211
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:52,330
information and you get your 6 months

1212
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:55,570
harassment free card right but that

1213
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:57,700
would have been prevented just by the 7

1214
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,930
IP addresses they publish 6 we knew

1215
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,060
about would just scan the internet

1216
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,730
machines for years those who have done

1217
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:06,580
blocked the that compromise never would

1218
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:08,710
have happened so you can focus your

1219
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:11,259
spend on things that matter where your

1220
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:13,480
gaps really are or the security vacation

1221
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,460
club right you go to conferences DEFCON

1222
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,620
blackhat don't go to don't go to

1223
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:19,180
blackhat don't go to RSA go to well I

1224
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,240
guess Derby is not a thing anymore go to

1225
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:26,470
smooth shumou in DC is good right and

1226
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,479
and and less products but I mentioned

1227
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,700
earlier right what about the unprotected

1228
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,870
the amount of the internet landscape

1229
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,899
that's actually in an enterprise

1230
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:37,150
environment is relatively small most of

1231
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,160
the Internet is just people at this

1232
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:42,790
point most Internet traffic is mobile

1233
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:44,950
devices often on 4G right which means

1234
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:47,860
there's no protection whatsoever as just

1235
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:50,500
the endpoint on the wild wild west you

1236
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:53,440
know there is no AV for iPhones right

1237
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:56,380
here's you know here's what you have

1238
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,850
right we work for companies we have

1239
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,310
budget we have training we have tools

1240
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,870
the unprotected doesn't they don't have

1241
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,540
tools training they're just folk right

1242
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:07,029
and I said a majority of mobile devices

1243
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,370
are out there and if I compromise an

1244
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,260
employee at home well I've compromised

1245
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:14,170
the organization how many of you heard

1246
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:17,080
of the shadow brokers release right lots

1247
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,030
of data stolen from the CIA right and

1248
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,779
and and there's a different one from the

1249
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:23,530
NSA and and all sorts of interesting

1250
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,900
leaks that have happened in the past

1251
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:28,090
couple years which would lead to the you

1252
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,040
know the question in your minds is how

1253
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,900
is it that one of the most well-funded

1254
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,900
intelligence agencies in the world can't

1255
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,060
keep a damn secret anymore but that

1256
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,100
happened because somebody brought

1257
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,500
hacking tools home because they're a

1258
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,940
contractor wanted to get ahead I'm sure

1259
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:47,110
many of you have brought your work home

1260
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:49,960
too he turned off his AV because he

1261
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:52,200
wanted to for whatever reason get a

1262
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,190
cracked version of Microsoft Office

1263
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,799
because he didn't

1264
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:58,480
I imagine what a salary was I don't know

1265
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:01,089
why hundred dollars would make or break

1266
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,250
him but he installed a crack version of

1267
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:05,019
office and he had to turn off his AV

1268
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,329
because AV was deleting his crack

1269
00:51:05,019 --> 00:51:08,859
version of office could have put in a

1270
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:11,279
directory exception whatever didn't do

1271
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:14,380
that realized he got all the malware

1272
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:16,960
because he didn't have a V anymore so

1273
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:21,460
bought Kaspersky Kaspersky is good

1274
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:24,369
antivirus kind of by russian company but

1275
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:26,650
it's good AV sol attack Kaspersky found

1276
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:28,119
all the malware and coincidentally the

1277
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,369
hacking tools that he was working on

1278
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,410
because well guess what those are

1279
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:34,299
hacking tools that AV shouldn't detect

1280
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:36,009
that and all these things ship it all

1281
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,990
back congratulations

1282
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:40,900
the Russians now have the CIA and NSA

1283
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:43,720
stools which created a great

1284
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,549
geopolitical shitshow between the United

1285
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,578
States and Russia over Kaspersky and

1286
00:51:45,549 --> 00:51:50,650
leaking these tools all sorts of fun but

1287
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:52,509
the matter is even intelligence agencies

1288
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,619
you had a contractor bring stuff he

1289
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,930
really should have brought home because

1290
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:58,390
it was highly classified but did anyway

1291
00:51:55,930 --> 00:52:01,538
and got compromised at home because it

1292
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:03,460
was outside of the Enclave right if I

1293
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:05,710
can compromise intelligence agencies the

1294
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:08,769
most well-funded Intelligence Agency in

1295
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:10,450
the world over this problem right this

1296
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:13,180
is where the problem that the problem

1297
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:15,848
really needs to be solved you're not

1298
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,660
normal right all the other normal people

1299
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:18,339
they don't know how to protect

1300
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,529
themselves right

1301
00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:21,970
you know what normal people do is I

1302
00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:24,009
don't know if anybody has a VCR anymore

1303
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,089
but I'm sure you have friends or family

1304
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:27,339
who couldn't figure out how to set the

1305
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:30,160
time on a VCR or a DVD player if it's

1306
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:31,650
still blinking 12:00 o'clock right we've

1307
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,058
got to solve the problem for that

1308
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:36,039
because we may be able to solve the

1309
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:38,289
problem in terms of the front end of our

1310
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:39,819
web interfaces but a duty to broader

1311
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:42,309
society has helped protect the ones

1312
00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:43,779
around us right we have all sorts of

1313
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:46,119
physical threats that are being emerged

1314
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:48,490
ten years ago the information security

1315
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:50,859
threat was information you'd lose credit

1316
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:54,129
cards you'd lose state secrets you lose

1317
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:55,690
whatever now we were inventing actual

1318
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:58,329
physical crimes or things that with a

1319
00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:00,190
physical Nexus right romance scams

1320
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:02,589
cyber bullying all this stuff which

1321
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,000
leads to body counts I don't know how

1322
00:53:02,589 --> 00:53:05,359
many people have killed themselves over

1323
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,940
cyber bullying but that

1324
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,589
number is not zero right and that is

1325
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,680
enabled by technology that we are in

1326
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:14,269
part helping to create if I steal user

1327
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,828
credentials for an online bank and

1328
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:18,229
transfer money you know are we gonna

1329
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:20,720
make the victim eat that loss you know

1330
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:25,069
in some cases we do in business email

1331
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,180
compromised in real estate fraud so with

1332
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:27,890
great leap this comes great

1333
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,839
responsibility we have all sorts of

1334
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:33,368
ability right we are trained

1335
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:37,190
professionals if we're we're not really

1336
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:39,259
protecting our employers one but society

1337
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,849
and generally until we start doing

1338
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:43,549
something about those unprotected there

1339
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:45,739
are resources for that there stop think

1340
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:47,480
connect you know you can have a session

1341
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:49,519
to protect consumers go meet with your

1342
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,369
Chamber of Commerce or a church group or

1343
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:54,470
a PTA or whatever and say hey you're

1344
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:56,089
having a problem with this here's

1345
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:57,799
something you can do for cheaper free

1346
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:59,779
because we have that knowledge and

1347
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:02,089
there's nobody out there doing it we

1348
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:05,319
could say why isn't the government doing

1349
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:09,349
X or one example why isn't the FBI

1350
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:11,180
prosecuting more cyber criminals because

1351
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:13,579
we would have to grow the FBI to an

1352
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:17,269
insane proportion to deal with the

1353
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:19,489
amount of crime what and that's skipping

1354
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:21,799
past how hard it is to get international

1355
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:25,579
cooperation in law enforcement because

1356
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:28,038
crime can transit can travel across

1357
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:30,950
borders and law enforcement jurisdiction

1358
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:33,440
doesn't right you could look at the

1359
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:35,328
global cyber cyber alliance they have a

1360
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,769
toolkit to protect elections and SMBs

1361
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:41,059
how many of you concerned about election

1362
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:43,069
security everybody is but the problem

1363
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:44,239
landscape for them is much the same as

1364
00:54:43,069 --> 00:54:46,190
what you dealing you or your own

1365
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,019
organizations the Illinois State Board

1366
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,999
of Elections had a sequel vulnerability

1367
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:52,459
I'm less worried about the state

1368
00:54:49,999 --> 00:54:53,749
election authorities because elections

1369
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:57,499
are governed and the votes are counted

1370
00:54:53,749 --> 00:55:01,220
locally I have counties in my state that

1371
00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:03,140
have sub 10,000 population they're never

1372
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:05,538
going to have resources to stand up to

1373
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,670
the Russians or the Iranians or the

1374
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:09,319
Chinese or anybody else that was

1375
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,079
inspired I'm up around in our election

1376
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:14,359
since 2016 it means the only thing that

1377
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,849
they can do is rely on somebody like me

1378
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:18,340
driving down to help them and say hey

1379
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:20,680
let's go look at your website

1380
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:22,630
let's go run a quick pen test let's go

1381
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,930
put you behind cloud Slayer so at least

1382
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:28,150
you have in effect some kind of a laugh

1383
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:30,220
at home so I protect myself right

1384
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:32,290
you got people to do it at home I've got

1385
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:35,200
two raspberry pies one running a piehole

1386
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:36,340
run running threat stop which you know

1387
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,470
that would cost them the money for

1388
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:40,660
normal people but just give people pie

1389
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:43,600
holes and just start blocking things in

1390
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,580
DNS which oh by the way starts blocking

1391
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,470
things from kids who like visiting where

1392
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,210
games and places on the internet they

1393
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,970
ought not to because kids click

1394
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:55,870
everything right it's two raspberry pies

1395
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:57,399
you know it's about $100 $120 and I

1396
00:55:55,870 --> 00:56:00,790
could block millions of domain names

1397
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,170
with it right it works is relatively

1398
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,660
simple I had to tweak it a little bit

1399
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,860
but by and large I travel a lot if

1400
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,839
there's any problem with the internet

1401
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,120
I'll hear about it and I've got to fix

1402
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,640
it for whatever so yeah I could I could

1403
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,109
create a whitelist and github

1404
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,620
doraleous I get to have fun with my kids

1405
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:21,130
every now and that yes Gabe I dunno what

1406
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:23,250
websites you're going to not sorry at

1407
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,250
all

1408
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:28,000
InfoSec will never be solved we can't it

1409
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:30,730
is it is I don't want to say it's an

1410
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,080
unsolvable problem but we can't solve

1411
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,920
humanity right

1412
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:37,600
I can't sanctify mankind I'm not sure

1413
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,080
mankind would like it if it were my

1414
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:43,120
brand of Santa fication we are making

1415
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,560
society less secure by adopting

1416
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,589
technology that we ought not to adopt

1417
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,330
but we can't say no we overcomplicate

1418
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:51,730
protection start simple go from there

1419
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:54,100
but also you know we've got to work and

1420
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,010
protect the unprotected right spend some

1421
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,060
measure of time sometimes pro bono

1422
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,830
protecting things around us that matter

1423
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,470
we all have skillsets that could solve

1424
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:05,860
some problem somebody in society is

1425
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:07,509
having right so I said I'm gonna make a

1426
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,460
good salary providing for our families

1427
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:11,620
it's all fine and good we need to expand

1428
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:14,110
the sphere of beneficence and obviously

1429
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,390
the actual risks are no longer just

1430
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:21,120
information right there are physical and

1431
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:21,120
real-world risks any questions

1432
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:29,619
I know it's not 10:00 a.m. quite yet but

1433
00:57:25,299 --> 00:57:33,690
you don't have to let me off easy it is

1434
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:39,940
I am bang on best speaker ever

1435
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:43,159
[Applause]

1436
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,159
[Music]

1437
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,600
you
