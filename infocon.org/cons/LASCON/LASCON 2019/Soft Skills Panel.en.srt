[Music]

2
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:42,350
okay come on paper oh and I've organized

3
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,350
this up Marcus you're already talking

4
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,030
okay I organized this team because I

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,920
think we're gonna get to a very

6
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,900
interesting topic interesting to me is

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,210
soft skills are they really soft

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,879
are they really hard you know it that

9
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,120
that's hug and you hear the idea of soft

10
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,230
and it sounds kind of wimpy so we're

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,959
gonna we're gonna get to all these

12
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,970
issues first I want everybody starting

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,149
with Wendy to introduce themselves and

14
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,000
to the audience please hi I'm Wendy

15
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:14,490
nathir I lead the Advisory seaso team at

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,369
dual security which is now part of Cisco

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,399
and as far as soft skills go I have

18
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,040
hacked some of the preeminent hackers in

19
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:28,280
the world because they never saw me

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,140
coming Wow what do you do to follow that

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,009
chip coy I'm a security consultant have

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,220
been for quite a while have have worked

23
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:42,390
at at a number of of commercial and

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,690
state governments and yeah like that and

25
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,670
it's the one of the reasons that I

26
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,310
chimed in on this is there was a lot of

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,390
discussion of well do you want to stay

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,209
technical or do you want to become a

29
00:01:51,390 --> 00:02:00,149
manager it's like well wait a minute why

30
00:01:54,209 --> 00:02:07,380
are those mutually exclusive so I'm

31
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:08,940
Marcus I'm just a country boy trying to

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,099
try to figure out how to make it in a

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,060
big city

34
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:18,149
and so I started company a couple years

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,010
ago we just sold the company about two

36
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,450
weeks ago to a company called robotic

37
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,760
West so I'm part of a lot of quest now

38
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,828
I'm doing a my title there it's called

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,989
Enterprise Architect I'm gonna get the

40
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:32,549
heck out more and code a lot more so I'm

41
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:36,540
pretty pumped with getting this far I

42
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:41,249
definitely use a lot of soft skills hi

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:45,180
I'm Tanya Jenkins should have soft

44
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:48,840
skills and I'm from a security sidekick

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,730
okay awesome so what I'd like you to do

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,730
now is starting with Wendy and going

47
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,290
dumb down the rope is take one soft

48
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,780
skill that pops into your mind and

49
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,510
describe it I'm trying to get at what

50
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,389
are soft skills because it's a little

51
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,418
bit fuzzy so go ahead

52
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:10,019
name one yeah soft skills to me

53
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,579
encompass it sounds manipulative but

54
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,250
actually building relationships with

55
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:16,979
people so that they will want to do what

56
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,109
you need them to do whether it is as a

57
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,500
parent getting your kid to get

58
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,989
potty-trained and using a combination of

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,509
bribery and and threats and an

60
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:31,139
obfuscation and deception to get them to

61
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,790
do that or whether it's you know trying

62
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,129
to convince an auditor that no you

63
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,810
really did address this problem even if

64
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,819
they don't recognize the words that

65
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,079
you're using so you know maybe

66
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,369
persuasion would be part of that oh good

67
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,849
you didn't take the one I was going to

68
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,530
talk about if there's one thing that I

69
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:54,619
keep running into over and over again

70
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:57,719
it's folks who are great pen testers

71
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,259
application evaluators and they don't

72
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:04,650
want to write so and when they do right

73
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,358
they get this this written diarrhea

74
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,699
where you know I'm going through pages

75
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:11,639
and pages and pages trying to find a

76
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:14,459
point like don't do that make the point

77
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,799
in the first paragraph spend as many

78
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,899
pages you need to back it up but I don't

79
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,298
care about your background I don't care

80
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:26,878
about your methods I want to know what

81
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:28,830
happened and what it means so I would

82
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:33,419
say that a couple of soft skills

83
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:36,240
leadership communications and

84
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,799
communication is definitely is the top

85
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,759
one because if you can communicate

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,250
properly you gonna be able to write well

87
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,800
you get people to do what they need to

88
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:52,199
do so I would say communication it's

89
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:54,569
definitely a soft skill I would say my

90
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,090
top skill is or that I look for is

91
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,710
empathy specifically the ability to put

92
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,000
yourself in someone else's shoes you can

93
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,039
understand where they're coming from

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,599
many times it worked with teams where

95
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,229
they only care about getting their

96
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:10,139
business unit done and at the peril of

97
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,729
everyone else and if you can't just for

98
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,129
a second look at things from other

99
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,240
peoples going to views it's really it's

100
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,419
hard to come to and these are

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,430
compromised that's really nice so does

102
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,389
anybody have any other examples of soft

103
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:27,000
skills that they would like to point out

104
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:30,389
um I think one that it you know it it

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,130
has been on display all day today when

106
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,800
when you've seen people talking it's the

107
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,229
ability to talk you know in public to

108
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,229
explain in language that people can

109
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,490
understand to be engaging even though

110
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:42,930
there are a whole bunch of you staring

111
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,719
at me and there's only one of me staring

112
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,520
at you but you know creating a

113
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:49,949
connection and that's often underrated

114
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,690
when you are bringing somebody in when

115
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,490
you're trying to hire somebody with that

116
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,069
skill who can make that sort of

117
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,400
connection one-to-many as well as

118
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:05,340
one-to-one I would also say cooperation

119
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:07,500
because they're really good if they want

120
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,779
to just work for themselves and never

121
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,699
work with other people for the rest of

122
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:15,529
us like 99% of people that have to

123
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,529
interact with other humans cooperations

124
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,700
that's a conflict conflict resolution is

125
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,130
super-important soft school to have

126
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,420
definitely uh I think that one of the

127
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,060
skills that definitely in the

128
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,670
cybersecurity industry new we have is

129
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:36,510
we're pretty much all smart probably you

130
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:38,130
know most before you know some people I

131
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,969
think everybody I work with pretty much

132
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,460
the super smart

133
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,610
everybody smarter than me but sometimes

134
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,289
if you're smart you can't take criticism

135
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,300
and so how do you how do you how do you

136
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,370
resolve those conflicts and I think

137
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,720
that's it that's something that I mean

138
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,860
you look on Twitter and you see people

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,570
going on because they can't resolve

140
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,510
conflict so that's a big one I never

141
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:02,010
thought of that that's neat yeah so the

142
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,840
the other one that as security

143
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,210
professionals we tend to skip right by

144
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,489
getting whoever we're working with

145
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,710
convinced about the problem we keep

146
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,020
trying to essentially sell them the

147
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,289
solution and if we stop for just a few

148
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,240
minutes and focus on getting everybody

149
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,420
getting to agreement that we have a

150
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,330
problem then it's just a matter of

151
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,010
picking a solution but if you can't

152
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,570
agree that there is a problem you're

153
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,340
just gonna spin your wheels and

154
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:33,210
everybody's gonna get frustrated and

155
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:39,119
yell at each other and no empathy no

156
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:42,930
cooperation no nothing okay any you're

157
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,680
good okay so by focusing on soft skills

158
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,690
are you diluting your technical prowess

159
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,900
any thoughts on that in any order that

160
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,219
you like because you you really instead

161
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,080
of being a hundred percent technical

162
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,310
heads down learning all you can in a

163
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,830
particular area you're kind of you know

164
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,060
generalizing and and is that healthy is

165
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,169
that good what do you think the balance

166
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,430
is I was gonna say what why and it as a

167
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,550
stripper saying why does that need to be

168
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,650
mutually exclusive it doesn't at all and

169
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,660
I suspect I'm gonna go out on a limb

170
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,179
here and say that the people who think

171
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,550
that technical is the opposite of soft

172
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,110
think that also that blue is the

173
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,819
opposite of pink and

174
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,830
that masculine is the opposite of

175
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:29,530
feminine and narrow the twain shall meet

176
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,150
and oh my gosh you won't catch me doing

177
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,429
this other thing because that's that's

178
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,439
you know antithetical to Who I am and

179
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,380
that's the kind of person that is the

180
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:45,790
most difficult to work with

181
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:54,100
yeah actually and he was talking about

182
00:08:45,790 --> 00:09:03,329
how basically people after work with you

183
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:06,100
you sound like humans that's a flop Oh

184
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:09,519
like just immediately I was like oh I

185
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,320
don't need to read the rest but I did

186
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,079
mostly so I could make fun of it but

187
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,149
yeah I don't think I think there are

188
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,099
people out there that hot that if they

189
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,540
can recognize in themselves that they

190
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,399
need to improve their soft skills like

191
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,890
when I was younger I actually on purpose

192
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,740
worked on my sociability skills because

193
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,660
I was too blunt and to direct and people

194
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,670
yeah I'm Way less blunt and direct now

195
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,589
can you imagine that Wow

196
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,860
yeah I worked on it because I would just

197
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:37,300
say exactly what I thought and it

198
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,990
apparently is intimidating and

199
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,060
terrifying venue a but no but like I

200
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,430
recognized as an issue and then I worked

201
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,719
on it and I think like willing to work

202
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,029
on things then you can become really

203
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,060
fully rounded and awesome and I don't

204
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,560
think my technical skills lack it's just

205
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,949
like an extra thing I knew I needed to

206
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:02,890
work on so sci-fi fans in the house

207
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:04,630
Bob Heinlein put it best you should be

208
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,540
able to lead you should be able to

209
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,089
follow ya hold and I'm gonna mangle the

210
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:16,420
quote but it ended with specialization

211
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:18,550
is for insects so if somebody says oh no

212
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,439
no I can't learn that this if I want to

213
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,219
stay technical like just say

214
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,079
specialization is for insects and then

215
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,290
we get to all explain it to HR later but

216
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,290
that's

217
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:35,939
yes sir I don't definitely uh on a

218
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,459
technical side I kind of look at it like

219
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:40,889
there's a lot of sayings like you know

220
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,979
if a tree ever Falls if a tree falls in

221
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:47,129
the forest nobody's around it's really

222
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,889
fall so I would say like you can be mad

223
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:51,569
technical but if nobody ever sees your

224
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:55,829
work or you're not able to communicate

225
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:57,269
something it it's gonna it didn't even

226
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:00,089
happen you know you're gonna be in your

227
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:01,079
cube all day doing whatever you done but

228
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,240
if you're not able to properly

229
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,550
communicate until they tell people that

230
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,829
story tell people why they should do

231
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,069
this tell people don't just don't just

232
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:13,319
issue edicts from you know just go

233
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:15,599
explain to people hey this is why you

234
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:17,699
need to have a password manager or

235
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,439
whatever you trying to do you can't do

236
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:21,870
it in isolation and he just can't send

237
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:24,059
stuff out it should be two-way dialogue

238
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,420
so even if you're like the most

239
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,499
technical person in the world if you

240
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,309
don't if you're not able to communicate

241
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:33,899
that in a way this is consumable you

242
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,990
know you're gonna have a terrible life

243
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,360
probably so so here's an example that

244
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,069
everyone can try at home try to explain

245
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,379
to somebody why their code is bad

246
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,199
without pissing them off there you go

247
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,420
technical soft skills in at the same

248
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:52,139
time go off and do it I would say that

249
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,660
not having soft skills is a it does

250
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,120
present a challenge for them and and the

251
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,040
the ones that I know want to work on it

252
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,019
because they realize it does present a

253
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,420
problem to them if they choose not to

254
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,480
work on it it doesn't make them bad but

255
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:23,219
it does mean that it it is going to be

256
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:25,620
more challenging for them well we all

257
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,569
have to you know we're all born with

258
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,029
certain skills traits characteristics

259
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:32,969
and what that does is it makes us us

260
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:35,579
right but I think everybody should try

261
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,430
to strive to be the best us you know

262
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,319
whatever they may be

263
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,989
and figure out how you communicate bus

264
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,920
you know and then you want to be

265
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,780
successful whatever you do so directly

266
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,640
to your point what do we do about people

267
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:54,530
who there are challenges when they're

268
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,360
put up in front of customers there are

269
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,839
challenges when they're put up in front

270
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:05,440
of executive management but they're

271
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:07,880
brilliant well it become this is where

272
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,160
you better hope that there's somebody

273
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,020
somewhere in the management chain who

274
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,209
doesn't believe that management and

275
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,569
technical are mutually exclusive because

276
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,550
that leads to that brilliant person

277
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,260
getting fired

278
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,479
whereas with some proper management

279
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,840
support they can still do brilliant work

280
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,180
and it can be properly recognized they

281
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,970
can get promoted all sorts of things but

282
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:36,530
it's gonna take support from other

283
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,150
people any follow-up can I handle air

284
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,650
too

285
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:43,850
I've worked with all sorts of types of

286
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:46,640
people and if someone's willing to have

287
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,890
effort things can go well even if like

288
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,180
they're super clumsy or you know if

289
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,800
they're on the spectrum and they have

290
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,010
certain things that just don't work for

291
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,810
them because of real reasons all of

292
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,060
those things I feel are things that you

293
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,400
can totally work with and get to where

294
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,040
you need to go especially if you

295
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,590
yourself have the social skills in order

296
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,569
to recognize ok so this person is not

297
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,400
you know getting my jokes or whatever

298
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,350
and so you can adjust yourself and your

299
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,260
communication style so that you can work

300
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,630
more effectively together however there

301
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,170
are some people in our industry just

302
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,160
like every industry who don't have like

303
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,620
something that is restricting them from

304
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,750
understanding social situations they're

305
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,910
just a jerk

306
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,649
and sometimes I've had people say like

307
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,730
oh that person's on the spectrum and I'm

308
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,620
like don't make fun of people with

309
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,779
autism because that's what you're doing

310
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,129
you're like you're blaming it on them

311
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:40,269
and that's not what's happening here

312
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:43,939
that person is jerk it's not the same

313
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:48,639
and so I think sometimes we need to be a

314
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:50,480
bit more sensitive when we make like

315
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,220
accusations like that like a lot of

316
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,720
people so I'm Dyslexic and while people

317
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,069
are like oh I spelled this wrong I'm so

318
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,350
dyslexic I'm like no you just made an

319
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:58,790
error and that's okay right and like if

320
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,170
someone's a jerk I don't think we should

321
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,819
be like oh they're on the spectrum I'm

322
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:06,290
like no dude yeah absolutely not and in

323
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,000
my experience people on the spectrum

324
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,649
know that they have difficulty

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,449
connecting with people and they are

326
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,730
desperate to reach out and make those

327
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,319
connections they want to do that they're

328
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,110
not like well I am the way I am and

329
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:20,449
that's just too bad I think some of the

330
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,939
jerky behavior that we see is a function

331
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:26,120
of a very different societal dynamic

332
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:28,610
where if you are seen as successful and

333
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,199
status in a certain way you start to

334
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,059
believe that you can behave however you

335
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:40,099
want to and that is absolutely that as

336
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:42,019
nothing to do with with autism remember

337
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,750
like I think it was like English 101 or

338
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:47,209
whatever basically and even like when

339
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,600
you do public speaking we take classes

340
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:53,359
on how to train people the first role of

341
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,509
that is always know who you're talking

342
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,089
to like know your audience and that's

343
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,980
what any public speaking thing will tell

344
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:02,899
you so I'm kind of I kind of know my

345
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,350
people this is my family the whole

346
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:09,259
hacker family you know so but everybody

347
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,509
that you interact with you and that's

348
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,639
worth that the empathy term comes in and

349
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:17,000
the play I know that that term is beat

350
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:21,079
up a lot because it means you soften you

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,480
know whatever right and it's like what

352
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,130
was crazy what that is like empathy just

353
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,300
means understanding

354
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:31,760
- and if somebody is you know I think as

355
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,959
they say the term on a spectrum you kind

356
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,830
of kind of understand alright this is

357
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,420
one talking to but again there is no

358
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:41,180
Evernote note there's no excuse for

359
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,449
being being a bad person or hurt other

360
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,819
people there's no cheese for a million

361
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,310
women on the internet have infirmed me I

362
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,590
don't have time to teach every single

363
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:56,270
person that says a sexist thing why

364
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:58,910
they're wrong well all work and open

365
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,400
yawn just do you know what I mean so I

366
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,250
think it really depends on but

367
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,230
professionally what people like I said

368
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,650
earlier I'm pretty direct so I'll be

369
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,300
like I didn't like that you said that

370
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,310
and they're usually just stare at me I'm

371
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,020
like here's why and they're usually

372
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,490
pretty uncomfortable but then they think

373
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,859
about it and we usually get along better

374
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,980
but your demeanor is very kind and

375
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:23,929
you're smiling I don't know if I smile I

376
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,089
think like sometimes I think sometimes

377
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,790
people can't tell if I'm upset because I

378
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,919
don't yell and scream I like never flip

379
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,510
out and so I'll tell people like when I

380
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,850
call customer service I'll be like I'm

381
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,100
irate and they're like oh I'm like no

382
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,010
like I'm very angry but I don't believe

383
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,449
in abusing nice people that have these

384
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,620
help desk jobs like it's not your fault

385
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,540
you didn't come over here and break my

386
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,189
things then we'd have words but like

387
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,450
there's no need for me to be a jerk but

388
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,730
could you tell them like right in the

389
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:55,460
notes of a customer was irate it works

390
00:17:51,730 --> 00:18:00,440
well so how do you deal with somebody

391
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,940
who's being a jerk who's there if you

392
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,420
believe they're capable of doing good

393
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,890
work and for whatever reason they're not

394
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,220
is that the definition of shirk read

395
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,220
think

396
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:18,809
well okay but well you know it's the

397
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:27,699
well so you're doing this well and that

398
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:29,499
well in this other great thing and you

399
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,940
could do these other great things except

400
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:33,700
the path you're on somebody's just gonna

401
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,620
shoot you dead so let's try and fix that

402
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,919
part so that you can do all these other

403
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,649
wonderful things I don't know is that

404
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,899
their pointy-eared boss approaches look

405
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:48,668
so anybody that you ever work with my

406
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:50,139
family teams organization you got to

407
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,360
make sure that everybody's trying to

408
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:54,008
achieve the same goal there's a really

409
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,869
good book called from good to great that

410
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:58,360
talks about this as long as the people

411
00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:00,789
in organization are a sinner or on the

412
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,070
same pad this is where I want to get and

413
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,869
then look hey you're not gonna I would

414
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,549
say if you want to get to this goal if

415
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:08,289
we both believe in this cold

416
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,720
you're not gonna we're not gonna get

417
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:12,730
there which you behave like this and so

418
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,730
if they believe that you're always gonna

419
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,740
if your team you know they gotta think I

420
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,179
don't play for the championship that's

421
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,980
why certain teams it's up year after

422
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,499
year because the organization don't care

423
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,649
about whether the championship or not I

424
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:28,869
hate to be totally totally you do it and

425
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:32,408
go to the sports analogies sports balls

426
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:34,449
yeah so what it is is like food what is

427
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:37,269
the goal we're all going towards this

428
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,399
goal and that's what it is also I

429
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:41,830
believe in you you should have some

430
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:43,268
sense of radical transparency is it is

431
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,220
it time people have you should be able

432
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,629
to tell somebody in their jerk if you

433
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,809
can't tell if you can't tell somebody

434
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:51,639
that I just I don't know if I could work

435
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:53,200
with people I can't just be a little bit

436
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:58,449
transparent little you know sound like

437
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:01,720
you're acting like a jerk man well in at

438
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,580
duo one of our official branded

439
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,179
corporate values is being kinder than

440
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,439
necessary and so you know I would not go

441
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,299
up to say somebody hey you're acting

442
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,700
like a jerk even though the transparency

443
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:15,668
is very transparent it's not very kind

444
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,340
so one of the things I've worked on with

445
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:20,049
a with the coaches one thing she taught

446
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,340
me about is called nonviolent

447
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:24,110
communication which is not where you

448
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,158
refrain from punching somebody over the

449
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:30,529
head but you you stay with fact-based

450
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,990
statements like you know you said this

451
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,799
when you said this maybe you didn't

452
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,970
realize it but it had the effect of this

453
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:40,279
now I don't think this is what you

454
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,200
intended is it because if you didn't

455
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,700
intend it this is what happened and

456
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,210
let's see if we can avoid this in the

457
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,610
future so you know you bring them in as

458
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,260
a problem that you know that you're both

459
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,320
facing the same problem that you want to

460
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,720
solve together and that can be that's

461
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,450
different from I don't know who heard

462
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,340
Josh SoCal's talk earlier today where he

463
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,070
came out and said somebody came up and

464
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,370
someone said you know you were a dick so

465
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:10,220
you know that sometimes that works with

466
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,840
people and sometimes it doesn't so but

467
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,580
luckily there are a lot of tools that

468
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,139
you can learn to do the right kind of

469
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,678
communication with somebody to give them

470
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:21,320
that feedback I'll add one other thing

471
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:24,260
and that's to all joking aside on the

472
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,350
getting shot dead thing is taken to the

473
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,720
consequences it's like if this continues

474
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,428
here here's the path you're on you know

475
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,490
that goes to Christmas future sorts of

476
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:36,529
thing and say look you know it's that

477
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,240
you've still got time to change your

478
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:41,840
path if you can do things just a little

479
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:45,020
more over this way you're gonna be a lot

480
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,080
more effective and you'll still have a

481
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,080
job

482
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:52,440
as a manager I was a little blunt I want

483
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:54,389
to try to steam ahead a little bit

484
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,519
because I want to I want to be sure we

485
00:21:54,389 --> 00:22:00,478
cover what would you recommend

486
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,639
you know people us do an info ii and

487
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:05,759
other apps ack to improve their soft

488
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:08,789
skills what are your recommendations of

489
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:12,690
how to really get it done how to make

490
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:15,779
progress first our doors and if you ask

491
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:21,869
a question we brought candy so I hope

492
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:24,570
that incentivizes you you know there's

493
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:27,570
bribery um the book that Wendy mentioned

494
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,099
nonviolent communication I read that in

495
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,339
a you know like when you start booking

496
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:34,439
uh but someone was like you should read

497
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,989
it so I did and then I got into it more

498
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,789
and more as continued and then one of

499
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:40,379
like I have like five thousand cousins

500
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:42,749
and one of my cousins called and we have

501
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:44,519
like this big fight and she was really

502
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:49,019
pissed at me about something I had not

503
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,639
realized for a while and then because I

504
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,799
could listen to it from this vantage

505
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:54,359
point of instead of her being like she

506
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,700
said something pretty snarky I was like

507
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,759
how long has this hurt your feelings for

508
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,710
and you didn't tell me why didn't you

509
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,659
tell me that you were upset all this

510
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,229
time and she's just like totally stocked

511
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:09,179
it was like and I don't think she

512
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:10,409
realized but if I hadn't read the book I

513
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,210
probably would have just been like a

514
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:13,769
fling that barb right back at you you

515
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,960
won't be challenged let's be childish

516
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:17,820
but that book really helped me kind of

517
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,379
see like oh she's coming at me with pain

518
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,239
like where is this coming from me oh

519
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:26,129
we're like BFFs where is this coming

520
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:28,649
from and I'm like oh yeah that's it

521
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:30,599
that's a great story yeah that that's a

522
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:32,549
great story I would say in general if

523
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,189
you're trying depending on which kind of

524
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:36,389
soft skills you're trying to develop

525
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,070
there are a lot of different ways there

526
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:40,498
are books there there's mentoring

527
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,029
there's coaching where you actually pay

528
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:44,700
a professional to work with you

529
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:46,919
one-on-one to develop in the areas that

530
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,139
you want to develop but with a lot of it

531
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,059
it has to be practice you have to have

532
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:53,580
muscle memory you have to be able to

533
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,979
work through the habit of responding in

534
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,000
certain ways to people or asking them to

535
00:23:55,979 --> 00:24:01,750
do things in certain ways

536
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,280
or even thinking about understanding

537
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,620
getting more situational awareness

538
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,960
around organizations and personal

539
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,810
dynamics so that you can make a better

540
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,220
plan for what you want to accomplish so

541
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,820
all of those things at a very high level

542
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,100
are things you can do when I work to say

543
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,770
you search for the key and I got into a

544
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:27,760
management role which I quickly cuz it

545
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:29,290
turns out that it's helped but but they

546
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,020
sent me on all these communication

547
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:34,690
courses and one of the ones like they

548
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,010
put us with people and they're like so

549
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,810
no one's officially the leader but you

550
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,930
have to do this and basically people

551
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,820
just immediately it turns out I'm that

552
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,680
leader type where I'm like okay well how

553
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,360
about this and I'm the tape where I ask

554
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,580
everyone's opinion and then we come up

555
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,870
with a plan and then we all agree sort

556
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,790
of thing but some leaders are like you

557
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:55,989
will do is say well the training they

558
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,149
sent us through was actually really

559
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:00,610
incredible I have no idea what's wrong

560
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,020
with all those managers because because

561
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,750
this training was amazing I'm like how

562
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:09,160
do you end up like that but anyway yeah

563
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:13,660
a similar story so after being in IT for

564
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,250
a decade and a half somehow I ended up

565
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,500
in a well I had a project that got

566
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,360
cancelled and I switched over to a more

567
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,720
political group to figure out what the

568
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,129
hell happened to my project and I guess

569
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,550
I missed a meeting because I ended up

570
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:29,380
being a rep to to some user group and

571
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,860
the first thing I did is send me off to

572
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,500
video charm school so you know there's

573
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:39,370
there's no fun like like being recorded

574
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,660
and critiqued by your peers so talk

575
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,000
about getting out of your comfort zone

576
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:46,360
but that's I think that's the the big

577
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,130
thing is what you do well well you do it

578
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,649
well you got to get out of your comfort

579
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,320
zone and a lot of the skills we talked

580
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,880
about they didn't certainly didn't come

581
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,010
naturally to me and they probably still

582
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,710
don't but you get out of your comfort

583
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:03,280
zone you learn something a little new

584
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:05,830
whether it's a communications course of

585
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,970
one sort or another or as simple as

586
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,379
sitting down and reading one of the

587
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,150
books

588
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,040
the last con reading list out of out of

589
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,830
all this because we've heard half a

590
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,600
dozen books that they probably are not

591
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,370
sitting on all of our bookshelves or if

592
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,550
they have that got dust on them and we

593
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:23,820
need to actually read them someday but

594
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:26,010
the one that I keep going back to for

595
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,689
that list is another one these little

596
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:30,629
thin books called getting to yes by the

597
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,760
Harvard negotiating project and it's

598
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,190
really about getting agreement on the

599
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,320
problem before you start trying to argue

600
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,320
people about which solution to pick a

601
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,190
couple of other examples of soft skills

602
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,540
and things you can do to learn them one

603
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,630
of them is being able to talk to the

604
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:54,000
press to be to be interviewed because

605
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,440
that you know that Pete your PR people

606
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,240
generally after they get to know you

607
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,940
they know who they can trust with an

608
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,530
interview and who they can't you know

609
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,570
like God don't put them in front is it's

610
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,100
very difficult especially if you're

611
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,649
getting difficult questions to be able

612
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,480
to be engaging with the the PR press

613
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,970
with the journalists and get them on

614
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,740
your side and saying gosh I wish I could

615
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,450
answer that but I'm not really not the

616
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,340
right person to do it let me come back

617
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,290
to you with this person but in the

618
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,050
meantime what I can say is this

619
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:24,780
wonderful thing about our company and do

620
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:26,639
it in a genuine way or as my dad used to

621
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,460
say if you can fake sincerity you've got

622
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,560
it made you know that that's another

623
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,530
kind of skill where there is PR and

624
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,590
media training that you can take for

625
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,270
that sort of thing another great place

626
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:43,379
where soft skills are very useful is in

627
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:45,210
usability at UX design and engineering

628
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,410
where if you can put yourself in

629
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,500
somebody else's shoes especially

630
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,960
somebody you know who's disabled

631
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,340
somebody who is non-technical somebody

632
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,170
from a different part of the world with

633
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,659
different cultural assumptions about

634
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,850
what they're seeing on the screen you

635
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,940
are going to make the technology so much

636
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,500
better so you know there's a huge you

637
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,630
know I guess we're all arguing that

638
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,670
there isn't a technical versus soft

639
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,800
skills that these all blend in together

640
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,330
and in fact applying the right soft

641
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,669
skills can make your technical skills

642
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,169
even better you know Wendy I just have

643
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,770
to pipe in here I'm not really on the

644
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,250
panel

645
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:22,320
I love I love the definition of product

646
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:26,429
manager is really grief counselor

647
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,070
because because it's it's true anyway

648
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:31,679
go ahead I think it's Marcus next yes so

649
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:35,070
I just want to say something I don't see

650
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:39,210
a lot of and this is a soft you know two

651
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:41,340
things just apologizing and of course

652
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:46,529
like being able to apologize if you mess

653
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:49,320
up like like you know you know I did you

654
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:50,880
know I system crazy and I definitely I

655
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,168
just bought that book of non-violent

656
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,990
committee cases because I need that so

657
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:59,520
much this is like therapy for me I'm so

658
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:01,980
hood it's amazing but uh so but yeah so

659
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,590
so basically forget being able to ask

660
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,010
for forgiveness we mess up is a boss

661
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:10,949
heart and also on a flip side forgiving

662
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:15,240
people when they mess up is a lost art

663
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:17,940
and so if if we can't we seem like we

664
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,700
can't do that definitely online I mean

665
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,919
like and people going about that there's

666
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,750
a council culture whatever side whatever

667
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,700
you feel about that but I do feel that

668
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,649
we we just forgot how to forgive each

669
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,020
other if people mess up or say something

670
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:33,360
wrong and it's part of that empathy

671
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,908
thing and this whole soft skill thing is

672
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,399
that there's this perception that you

673
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:40,350
have to do everything perfect you nobody

674
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,260
in this room is perfect you want to mess

675
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:46,049
up say you're sorry and if somebody says

676
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:50,779
and it's a SERP apology they didn't

677
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:55,668
never mean anything about it just real I

678
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:55,669
love it owning our mistakes is so

679
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:01,890
selvedge many relationships by by saying

680
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,970
that was my fault how can I fix this I

681
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,799
got work

682
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,110
something happens especially with

683
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,030
security like okay so we dropped the

684
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,040
ball on that what can we do now and what

685
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:15,928
can we do in the food that that never

686
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:18,299
ever happens again NIT you know who here

687
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:18,900
has never made a mistake go ahead come

688
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:23,760
on somebody

689
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:25,890
yeah right yeah you know in all in all

690
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,679
humbleness with soft skills you're wrong

691
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:33,600
it's I mean we make mistakes in IT

692
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,130
what's the old saying if builders built

693
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,809
buildings the way programmers wrote

694
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:40,890
programs the first woodpecker to come

695
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:42,510
along would destroy civilization so you

696
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,549
know we're in the mistake business so we

697
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,549
got it we got to take what we do in our

698
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:49,020
in our nice technical world with you

699
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:51,480
know stuff up on the screen it's like oh

700
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,309
goodness I screwed it up again and take

701
00:30:51,480 --> 00:31:04,500
that to the human realm and be a little

702
00:30:53,309 --> 00:31:07,830
more forgiving of each other on that is

703
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,990
a is weak we sometimes insecurity

704
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,210
we have people so afraid to make a

705
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,220
mistake they're not gonna if they

706
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:16,230
clicked on something and they got owned

707
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,290
instead of coming and telling you eh

708
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:22,020
I clicked on something they're not it's

709
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:24,600
about communications they should have a

710
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,160
policy to be able to come to you you

711
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,418
should be totally approachable as a

712
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:32,460
security person in our organization

713
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:35,250
Inessa that's a part like like you know

714
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,870
when to all classical I'm McMahon ops I

715
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,549
feel like some of the whole school

716
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,979
technology I know but when you when

717
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:45,210
you're doing communications you have to

718
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,669
have an open socket ready to listen for

719
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,919
anybody coming in and bound and that's

720
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:53,280
something that we're good at talking a

721
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,820
lot but we suck and listener yeah that's

722
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,820
so true

723
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,520
so the question was is sitting in a

724
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,559
meeting with customers being

725
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,780
customer-facing in your role is that an

726
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,520
effective way to build slav skills or

727
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,559
taking along and watching like how the

728
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,030
salespeople work I think if you want to

729
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,280
learn the art of persuasion and sales

730
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:30,570
definitely you should watch salespeople

731
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,129
because they're amazing know what if I

732
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,320
would think that was the best way I have

733
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:51,590
to say I've seen a lot of salespeople

734
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:54,629
that make me unhappy and I would suggest

735
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:57,780
putting a little work in to acquire some

736
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:00,960
skills in dealing with people who are

737
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:02,970
paying the bills first because being in

738
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,640
a sales meeting and you know the lead

739
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:07,500
sales guy says XYZ and you put your head

740
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,590
down on the table because it was just so

741
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:15,000
wrong it's probably not the best way to

742
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:21,209
build sales skills or stay employed but

743
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:25,169
a little a little learning in this area

744
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:27,600
goes a long way and hey pregame it you

745
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,590
know chat with the salespeople what what

746
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,719
does it you think you're gonna tell

747
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,850
these people oh we're gonna say the

748
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,640
product does X Y & Z it's like well you

749
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,439
got one out of three can we tune that up

750
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,600
a little bit before you you tell the

751
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,210
customers better do that before you're

752
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,799
sitting in front of the customers then

753
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:47,190
at the table but there was part of the

754
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,870
question of just observe hey come on hey

755
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,520
who in this room can observe when

756
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:58,139
somebody's telling a blatant lie and not

757
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:59,370
not guffawed what's up no no no I don't

758
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,150
think wait

759
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:05,340
I think everybody in life and I'm

760
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:08,159
actually a tech guy who learned how to

761
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,580
do sells and I sold my own product or

762
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,050
whatever right so I would say that it at

763
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,049
the root of it we're all just trying to

764
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,139
help each other out and if you just have

765
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:21,530
that mantra if your sales person

766
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:24,720
software person helped us cybersecurity

767
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:27,000
how can I help you out how can we do

768
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,319
this the best way we can do it how can

769
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,659
we do the solution the best way we've

770
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,330
known how can i how can I give you the

771
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:36,210
right solution that you need but I have

772
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:38,190
to listen first and that's what a great

773
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,580
salesperson is always going to do listen

774
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:43,409
and then give you the solution the best

775
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,549
that they can give you and that's like

776
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:49,409
life in general my wife my kids you have

777
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,750
to learn how to listen and you have to

778
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:55,139
give them what what what they what they

779
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,660
uh what they want for sure and then

780
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,960
sometimes what they need I mean I mean

781
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,920
what they need and then what do you want

782
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,910
some of what you're talking about comes

783
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,530
down to basic teamwork is everybody had

784
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,000
you have to have a little discussion

785
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,220
before hands such that everybody

786
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,030
understands that we're not gonna bayonet

787
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:18,569
our buddies in front of the customer and

788
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:21,080
that's that can be tough I mean I can

789
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:23,070
tell you that that's a lesson

790
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,319
particularly dealing with folks who are

791
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:27,270
in customer support sales problem

792
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,150
resolution all those nice customer

793
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,710
facing roles as a as a guy well behind

794
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,710
the scenes that took me a while to

795
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,890
figure out to go back to your question

796
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:40,230
though I do agree that you know like

797
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:44,790
working with your teammates on other

798
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:47,040
teams for instance I get with it and

799
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,910
helping them I'm holding this

800
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,130
incorrectly it keeps cutting in

801
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:55,269
yeah okay we'll just pretend you can

802
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:56,950
only hear me oh I do agree um other

803
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:59,229
members of my team are doing it's a

804
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,730
great way to learn more about how they

805
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,440
communicate and what they do and what

806
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,299
their role is so that you can understand

807
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,619
and have empathy in your role like I

808
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:12,240
think part of why I hate going to you I

809
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:14,529
think prior the reason why I'm good at

810
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,569
working a knapsack is because I as a

811
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:18,880
software developer so long and I view

812
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:20,109
those as my people if that makes sense

813
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,759
and so I'm always like how can I help

814
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:24,549
you make your app securely I'm your

815
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:26,859
helper as opposed to sometimes like

816
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:28,269
people that have not come from it from

817
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:29,619
that angle sometimes they have trouble

818
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,118
understanding so if you're trying to

819
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:33,039
learn soft skills and you see someone

820
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,269
who has awesome soft skills observing

821
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,230
them does sound like a brilliant idea

822
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:40,990
yeah yeah I would agree that yes

823
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,230
observing and a lot of different you

824
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,549
know customer facing or you know

825
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,160
interfacing roles like a product manager

826
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:50,440
who has to deal with interface with so

827
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,328
many different people in order to get

828
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:57,880
one thing done or to get something out

829
00:36:52,329 --> 00:37:00,609
the door or tech support or or sales or

830
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,640
you know any of these other things are

831
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:06,490
are great but first you have to see a

832
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,828
model of what success looks like because

833
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:12,339
I know a lot of organizations but thank

834
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:14,470
you judge you know he's dangerous

835
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:16,000
you have to I know a lot of

836
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,828
organizations where you can watch what's

837
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,960
going on but they are not consciously

838
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:22,480
developing the soft skills that are

839
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,259
needed to be successful in that role so

840
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,819
if you see a salesperson who is very

841
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:29,230
aggressive and from the customer mentor

842
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:31,150
and you happen to see them when they

843
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,160
manage to close a deal you'll think that

844
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,859
those behaviors are what you know

845
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,799
successful soft skills are like and they

846
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:41,619
might or they might not be so you know

847
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:44,170
look look at other leaders around you or

848
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:46,150
managers or people who you you know

849
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,910
people say wow so-and-so is really good

850
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:51,220
you know Kate is you know she is

851
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:54,618
brilliant at you know calming down

852
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:57,169
people or you know matters

853
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:58,910
fantastic manager and you know everybody

854
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,769
knows it you know you can talk to him

855
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,480
say what what's your secret and if they

856
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:04,519
are consciously developing certain

857
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,359
skills then you can say great where can

858
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:10,910
I learn and practice those yeah you know

859
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:13,369
it back to your point about speaking up

860
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,499
and hitting that yeah putting your head

861
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:17,059
on their desk it's that's a really good

862
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:19,549
way when you don't know all the facts to

863
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:21,619
get fired it's because you know

864
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:23,240
especially if you're very junior and you

865
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:26,359
blurt out what you believe to be the

866
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,129
truth it's very risky three million

867
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:34,788
short and information security getting

868
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:36,440
fired but one of the things we talked

869
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:38,390
about we're sort of dancing we've talked

870
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,160
a couple of times about the manager

871
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:43,038
versus technical I think there's an

872
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,308
assumption that managers are expert at

873
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,259
some of these soft skills when in many

874
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:50,390
most cases nothing could be farther for

875
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:53,150
the from the truth it's I've had a few

876
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:55,069
good bosses but many of them have

877
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:58,609
resembled the pointy-haired boss from

878
00:38:55,069 --> 00:39:00,980
Dilbert so it's one of the things that

879
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:03,319
we do as a as a set of technical folks

880
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,999
if we say no no we're gonna stay

881
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:07,970
technical we're not gonna learn that

882
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:10,189
other stuff is we're depriving the

883
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:13,578
organization of people who know what the

884
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:16,880
heck they're doing I feel like there's

885
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:19,640
managers there's leaders and sometimes

886
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,579
you get both of those traits and the

887
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,098
same person and it's magical and I've

888
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:28,039
had amazing managers but that didn't

889
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:30,230
really lead I would do that usually or

890
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,150
you know amazing leaders that I can

891
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,400
follow but they didn't really do the

892
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,049
management evening yeah I was gonna

893
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,059
mention there there are also different

894
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:40,160
styles of management in one position I

895
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:41,720
was trained on different styles where

896
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,970
some people are you know much more

897
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,160
comfortable being coached where you're

898
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,839
you're encouraging them and you're

899
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,609
teaching them what they need to know in

900
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,499
order to be able to carry out you know

901
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:53,239
their responsibilities there other

902
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:54,950
people who prefer delegation where you

903
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:56,809
just say hey here's something go take

904
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,189
care of it and you leave them to do it

905
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:59,839
the way they want to and they're very

906
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,730
happy with that there are different

907
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,349
combinations of that I think another

908
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,930
thing you can work on if you are

909
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:07,320
managing people is to be able to manage

910
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,180
each person in this

911
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,230
they like that in the style that they

912
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:15,120
like the best that they prefer and you

913
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,990
know also be able to manage upward in

914
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,549
the style you know which yet your your

915
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:23,729
supervisor won't you know prefers you to

916
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,710
use I was in a job interview and like a

917
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:27,120
while ago and the person that was doing

918
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,640
the hiring asked me what my love

919
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,170
languages were so he could make sure he

920
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,990
managed me well and I'm like I just need

921
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,760
to hear like good job I hope you didn't

922
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:40,560
say was touch because that would have

923
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,640
gotten you in a lot of trouble but

924
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,380
there's like different types of

925
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,859
communication right and some people like

926
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,540
a bonus will make them feel valued and I

927
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,550
like money in my bank account just to be

928
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,490
clear but hearing I do a good job it's

929
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:57,380
like magical for me and having your

930
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,379
manager ask that it's like oh you care

931
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:04,529
so I want one thing so one of the books

932
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:07,170
I like that taught me a lot of like

933
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:10,860
solve related skills and I definitely

934
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:13,110
need some work for sure but the four

935
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:20,790
agreements I wonder too one of the four

936
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:26,220
grievances memories the second thing to

937
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:28,380
go I was gonna say what's the beater

938
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:33,689
staff award to work be impeccable which

939
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:35,340
that's the one that's the one what's

940
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,560
cool about that book is also talks about

941
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,630
how you talk to yourself inside your own

942
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,060
head and so that's something you have to

943
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,790
you got to make sure that you're good

944
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,490
with yourself and then you can go out

945
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:49,320
you can be the case of people so make

946
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,229
sure that you're taking in positive

947
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,140
stuff and you're and that's gonna help

948
00:41:52,230 --> 00:42:01,010
you'll go a long ways it's helped me

949
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:03,450
sure okay what do you think about the

950
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,310
technical track and management track

951
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,109
like IBM for years has had the IBM

952
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:08,940
fellow and and and they're allowed to

953
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:11,280
just basically do whatever they want

954
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,130
because they're so brilliant technically

955
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,930
that they

956
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,540
take it they can make as much as the VP

957
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:18,640
with 500 people reporting to them kind

958
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,490
of thing do you think that works and

959
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,230
it's just perspective on what size of

960
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,939
company it might work at or if you don't

961
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,340
think it works at all do you mean like

962
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,560
an individual contributor yes where you

963
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,500
can make you can you have an equal but

964
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:34,029
you don't have to manage people track

965
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,620
part of why I left the Canadian

966
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,240
government is because I was sitting at

967
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,609
the highest technical position for over

968
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,129
a decade and there was just nowhere for

969
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,380
my career to go so I wasn't getting

970
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,540
raises anymore and like all I could do

971
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,460
is just try cool new jobs and have like

972
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,400
really cool high-profile projects and I

973
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:54,670
was just like you know I'm I'm not even

974
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,290
old yet at all I saw Unzen and they're

975
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,610
like that you can retire in 18 years I'm

976
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:02,230
like you think I'm gonna not have a

977
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:03,850
promotion for 18 years like I gotta go

978
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:06,130
I'm gonna do bigger better things and

979
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:07,839
they're just like what and I explained

980
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,160
to them if you don't have a place work

981
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,030
for that person to go and they have to

982
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,029
go into management

983
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:15,490
some people love management I'm glad so

984
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:18,640
you can do that job instead of me but

985
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,859
like it's not for everyone and yeah you

986
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,379
you end up ending people's careers and

987
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,950
they go somewhere else yeah absolutely I

988
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,600
mean I'm at Cisco where we have a

989
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:30,759
individual contributor or you know a

990
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,960
technical track I don't want to say that

991
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,730
they're the opposite or that they're

992
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,340
separate there's a managerial track and

993
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:39,520
an individual contributor track and you

994
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,170
can be a very technical manager but if

995
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,660
you're a manager you're on a particular

996
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,700
track up to certain grades and if you're

997
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,830
an Icee you get up and you don't manage

998
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,640
anybody you can get up as high as I

999
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,310
think fellow

1000
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,870
I think cisco has fellows I haven't

1001
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:57,009
found that part out yet I've only I'm

1002
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:59,470
only a year in but when I when duo was

1003
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,720
acquired by Cisco they couldn't figure

1004
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,629
out what to do with my team because we

1005
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,870
are all former CISOs so we're very you

1006
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:10,270
know high highly placed technically but

1007
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:13,390
I was only managing four people and that

1008
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:15,610
didn't fit into the scales that they use

1009
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,129
to map roles from one to the other so

1010
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:20,680
either I would have had to be a much

1011
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:23,860
lower rated manager managing these very

1012
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,480
senior technical people or what they

1013
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,400
ended up doing was putting me on

1014
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,500
the same level as them technically in

1015
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,420
the icy track and then putting some

1016
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,480
flipping some bit that said I was also a

1017
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,040
manager so that I could see their stuff

1018
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:46,750
but yeah they weren't really sure how to

1019
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:49,300
make those two things match either good

1020
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:52,840
so basically there's managers and

1021
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,730
leaders I think that sometimes yeah I

1022
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,619
don't I don't those aren't the same

1023
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,570
people so you definitely interview

1024
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:00,040
individual contributors they don't they

1025
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,109
don't want to they don't want to manage

1026
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,369
nobody and sometimes you don't want them

1027
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:06,940
to manage anybody either

1028
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:09,220
right for sure so I think both are

1029
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,560
needed and what's funny though is that

1030
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,569
sometimes those individual contributors

1031
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,850
can be the leaders they can be the rock

1032
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:18,130
star that everybody wants to be like and

1033
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,750
so sometimes they can be toxic they make

1034
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:22,420
a lot of money they can party out of

1035
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,369
town and and they they're very

1036
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,869
influential and organizations so

1037
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:29,140
sometimes those people can be the leader

1038
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:32,920
of an organization but they don't have

1039
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:35,859
any management responsibilities so as a

1040
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,580
manager sometimes you're not you can be

1041
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:42,340
not respected I would say in some cases

1042
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:44,830
but uh again so what if if you have that

1043
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,680
going on and I've seen it in person

1044
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:49,660
where we have rock star people everybody

1045
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,220
wanted to everybody want to work with

1046
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,049
that person everybody wants to hang out

1047
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,629
with that person but in their neighbor

1048
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,340
like totally ignored of management so

1049
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:00,250
that's why your communications inside an

1050
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,680
organization are critical tell your

1051
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,810
rockstar a rockstar it's called but they

1052
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,000
actually work for me me they came to go

1053
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:08,910
Nicole research that you've done hey we

1054
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,280
have to we have to do that's wet

1055
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,940
communications credible so it's

1056
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,950
interesting

1057
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,750
Kate and I are both recovering IV

1058
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:19,330
Emmer's so when you look at that

1059
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,950
organization in many ways the the first

1060
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:23,890
level where you were actually managing

1061
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:27,640
people was more equivalent to sort of

1062
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:29,980
the sergeants it more in line with squad

1063
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:33,339
leaders than it did lieutenants and on

1064
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:35,410
up using the military analogy and it's

1065
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,910
interesting it was you'd see a lot of

1066
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,629
people who would do very well in that

1067
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,359
because

1068
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:44,440
and then if they got promoted where

1069
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:46,410
their primary duty was doing budgets and

1070
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,309
all of a sudden they're like yeah we're

1071
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,618
don't you have some technical work that

1072
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:52,960
I can do and that's where people tend to

1073
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:55,539
switch back over to the technical tracks

1074
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,920
where they brought in the first line

1075
00:46:55,539 --> 00:47:01,119
manager you do all the people management

1076
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:04,029
nonsense sorry I want to put PowerPoint

1077
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,119
in with the budget thing because so many

1078
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:10,779
people have just been crushed for

1079
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:14,619
PowerPoint yes but it's the right code

1080
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:16,150
now they do powerpoints yeah and and the

1081
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:18,160
people who were been doing PowerPoint

1082
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,220
for a decade while we were writing code

1083
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:25,960
beat us to death so let's not do that

1084
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:28,240
but if nobody takes those first line

1085
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,069
manager roles the folks who are doing

1086
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,979
great technical work tend not to get

1087
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:35,799
promoted because if it's only Dilbert

1088
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,730
the pointy-haired boss and those first

1089
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:39,099
line manager roles

1090
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:49,660
it's the weasel gets promoted and

1091
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:55,599
everybody else gets shafted so it's a

1092
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:56,890
inaccurate so it's the in many ways a

1093
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,869
lot of those first line management

1094
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,190
positions what we're talking about you

1095
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:02,200
have to acquire a little bit of soft

1096
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:06,220
skills beyond just being able to crank

1097
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:10,990
out code or blow stuff up there there's

1098
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:12,910
a lot of value in there in many ways you

1099
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,669
look at those those first line

1100
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:18,098
management positions and they're more on

1101
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:20,770
the follow me model than they are on the

1102
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:22,720
you know let me play out our corporate

1103
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:25,569
objective sort of things so if you're

1104
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,538
looking to stay technical you don't have

1105
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:31,150
to not do management in many ways it

1106
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:34,420
becomes a in order for all of the

1107
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,920
technical folks to thrive somebody has

1108
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,780
to take the position

1109
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,630
managing or you know working with peers

1110
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,920
is one of the hardest social engineering

1111
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:46,099
tasks that there is and unfortunately

1112
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,810
that's the the role that the CSO has to

1113
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:50,119
do a lot of the time in order to get

1114
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:51,650
things done unless they actually you

1115
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:53,450
know have the root passwords to

1116
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:56,599
everything they're going to have to

1117
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:59,089
convince peers across the organization

1118
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:02,869
to work with them and and to get things

1119
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:04,460
done so it's it's it's very if you think

1120
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,950
soft skills is just appealing to

1121
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:10,160
hierarchy you're completely wrong it's

1122
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:14,560
it is what you do with people in the

1123
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,560
absence of any authority that you have

1124
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,210
windows admins

1125
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,760
and so what I did and this is kind of

1126
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:34,130
technical but it's also soft skills

1127
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,770
approach so what I used to do I

1128
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:40,160
I said way back inators to be a Solaris

1129
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:42,820
admin as well so so this will be a

1130
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,069
Solaris stuff for UNIX people so I

1131
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,330
understood how to do patching and

1132
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:49,369
configurations and stuff so I would I

1133
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:51,109
would I would take take the run ability

1134
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:54,800
report over I see then you got all these

1135
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:56,180
bones and here's how you fix it or you

1136
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,099
have this Windows things you need to do

1137
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,299
this domain policy and this is how you

1138
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:01,609
this how you set that up

1139
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,800
it's actually going the extra mile to

1140
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:05,089
learn a little bit more but you can

1141
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,780
actually take that to all the

1142
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:08,900
organization

1143
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:11,030
all your peers because like the truth is

1144
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,710
you don't work with you just don't work

1145
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:14,960
with security people it's all those

1146
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:17,119
other people that you work with and so

1147
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,369
as much as you can make it a layup for

1148
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,560
them I mean like a point guard

1149
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:23,510
now this sports ball analogy you're

1150
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,270
giving them you're giving it out you're

1151
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:28,700
trying to make everybody's life easier

1152
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:30,440
and that's how I've done you know how do

1153
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,560
I help other people in the organization

1154
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,370
get better you know maybe you learn a

1155
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,130
little bit

1156
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:38,529
code or on a scanner or impaired image

1157
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:41,840
that run the scan rooms than themselves

1158
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:45,830
so it's always a way to work with those

1159
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:48,800
organizations and them as well when um

1160
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:51,590
so I used to be a CSO and when I first

1161
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,430
graduated let's call it that into the

1162
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,190
sea so roll

1163
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:57,710
we had a pen tester perk him in or all

1164
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:01,780
these things wrong I was very upset and

1165
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:05,480
I had a meeting with all of the bosses

1166
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:07,880
and fire we have to fix these things and

1167
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,800
they just thought didn't know and after

1168
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,480
I you know I went to my director I'm

1169
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,280
like what do I do and he's like ton you

1170
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,440
can't just yell at us industry best

1171
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,720
practice blah blah blah you have to

1172
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,180
explain it in words that we understand

1173
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,490
we're all really smart that's why we all

1174
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,020
have these jobs but we don't know the

1175
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,850
security stuff that you know so you have

1176
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,860
to explain it in a way so we understand

1177
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:30,130
how's this gonna affect my developers

1178
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,930
how's this gonna affect our operations

1179
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,850
like what are the actual risks to our

1180
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,910
business so I came back the next week

1181
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:40,339
and I was ready and I explained exactly

1182
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:42,170
what you know so because we're not using

1183
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,120
these security headers this could happen

1184
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,470
if you click on this link I made for you

1185
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,600
here's this proof of concept where this

1186
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,240
happened you see the risk here this kid

1187
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,190
and everyone voted unanimously yes a

1188
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,379
week later and he's like you have to

1189
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:56,270
learn how to communicate clearly you

1190
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:59,090
have to talk in their language not your

1191
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:00,920
