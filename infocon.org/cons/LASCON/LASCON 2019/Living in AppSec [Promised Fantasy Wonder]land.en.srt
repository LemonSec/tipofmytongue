00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,739
is a really abstract fantasy land but I

6
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,440
work at github which which many we'll

7
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,330
get to why we the the the background of

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,730
the joke kind of the running joke that

9
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,559
github is app sec Fantasyland in fact

10
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,599
Justin Justin just walking in if you

11
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,330
turn and look at his shirt we'll be

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,970

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,250
stuff from that podcast that is where

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,910
the running joke about it started so

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,410
perfect timing Justin thank you and I

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,920
chatted briefly with James wicked

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:17,009
anybody know wicked here you know we

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,869
talked a little bit he said you know he

19
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,640
said you know a lot of these talks we

20
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,040
give we're all given like variations on

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,340
the same talk you know so as I sat

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,500
through Dan's and Tonya's and now Justin

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,149
Sacher thought yeah we're gonna a lot of

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,460
these same things we're starting to say

25
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,630
here so so if you guys don't enjoy my

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,479
talk you probably heard it somewhere

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,100
else so you fall asleep because you just

28
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,319
had lunch that's alright you probably

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,288
heard no I I think there's some unique

30
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,509
things and and my purpose here is is not

31
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:49,580
to promote github not to tell you to use

32
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,899
this although it's great if you do but

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,420
genuinely I got to get hub and I was

34
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,209
like this is amazing like I'm amazed at

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,550
what they're doing here app SEC wise as

36
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,959
a longtime developer so so let's just go

37
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:06,240
ahead and transition to that Who am I

38
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:08,610
did development for 15 ish years all the

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,880
way back to the days of slinging Perl

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,510
anyone ever write a CGI script can you

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,490
claim that yes did that have always been

42
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,769
interested in security in the year 2000

43
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,209
around 2000 I was a grad student they

44
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,030
brought me to work on a data warehouse

45
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,650
and they got me a log and I'm like how

46
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,480
does this authentication stuff work I'm

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,010
really curious about this there was this

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,010
new thing called cookies by the way

49
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,920
they weren't using cookies they were

50
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:41,160
passing a hidden input from page to page

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,470
to page to page valid username in the

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,130
input hidden input you're logged in that

53
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,700
works so I put my exploit on a floppy

54
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,460
disk

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,989
the the three-and-a-half inch walked it

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,610
down to the project leads opposite said

57
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,340
you know you have a problem here and and

58
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,020
he was for to my good fortune he didn't

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,230
expel me from the school didn't call the

60
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,770
FBI for hacking he said thank you he

61
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,500
said you've just made a theoretical

62
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,680
debate we've had real you demonstrated a

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,660
real problem now go go work you young

64
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,450
grad student go work with the 50 year

65
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:20,040
old IT guy to fix this problem whose

66
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,929
thing you just broke and then I learned

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,900
I said I'm not qualified for that and he

68
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,750
said well the land of the man with one

69
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,260
eye is king and land of the blind so go

70
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,760
help him anyway so that that was my that

71
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,350
was kind of the start of my interest in

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,160
web application security I saw how

73
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,769
brittle it was not until 2016 did I

74
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,790
start working full-time I'll get to the

75
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,250
last con connection in just a moment and

76
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,390
everyone's me with imposter syndrome

77
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,890
right feeling like you don't belong

78
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,750
everyone knows more than you I'm

79
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,640
postured my way into work in an abstract

80
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,000
fantasy land ie

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,670
github so there's hope for you if you if

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,930
you're if you feel you're struggling

83
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,390
also I don't have this on here but I've

84
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,040
worked on web goat from an old purse

85
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,230
pecked above yours I don't put it on

86
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,019
here because I haven't done squat in

87
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,290
like two-plus years so I've done squat

88
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,190
but very little so for the last gun

89
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,099
connection there were some good things

90
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,779
you may have seen this image circulating

91
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,700
around the bottom image here from Pete

92
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,549
chest lock this was part of the keynote

93
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,800
when I came to Alaska in 2015 that image

94
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,900
has gotten a lot of mileage and it's in

95
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,480
some ways true about our life at github

96
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,419
some ways not so I thought it was worth

97
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,740
including Jack Daniel also gave a talk I

98
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,420
think it's a good reminder something

99
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,120
just good to remember it's not germane

100
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,070
to my talk today but he talked about

101
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,380
saying on the shoulders of giants and I

102
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,060
think it's always important to

103
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,730
you do you remember that there's someone

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,850
came before you laid some groundwork and

105
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,860
to be grateful for that

106
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,750
as far as the last gun connection anyone

107
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,480
seen the job board ie the white board

108
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,300
out here so I took a picture of that

109
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,350
took home and the one booth that I

110
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,020
didn't stop at Aztec consulting I they

111
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,270
had written up on that board I sent them

112
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,460
an email and that was my and my entree

113
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,260
into app application security full-time

114
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,630
work working with Aztec good company

115
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,170
they're now part of Moss Adams which is

116
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,900
a larger consulting firm like a like a

117
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:24,290
smaller grade like a smaller version of

118
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,789
Ernst & Young sort of thing so anyway

119
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,350
that's my last kind of connection so I

120
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,150
appreciate last con I think it's a great

121
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,020
conference and I have an extra special

122
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,390
connection there so let's talk about why

123
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,650
this app sec fantasy land here is

124
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,030
anybody recognized I know Justin

125
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,650

an app sec team we also have a project

166
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,370
team but credit where credit's due

167
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,810
you know I I struggle with putting this

168
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,950
presentation together I don't want to

169
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,660
sound elitist I don't want to sound

170
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,000
jaded I just really want to share

171
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,770
something I hope will benefit someone

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,570
else I think it's really cool to see

173
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,569
what what's happened at github from an

174
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,060
application security perspective and so

175
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,250
top left is Greg OSA I'm not going to go

176
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,260
through everybody he's my boss you saw

177
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,560
him briefed briefly in that clip and he

178
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,480
runs the app SEC team he along with let

179
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,760
me see if my pointer works Neal that's

180
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,130
Neal that was mentioned Patrick to me

181
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,950
and Bente is here they're kind of the

182
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,810
original app sect team at github and

183
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,690
have done a lot of work along with other

184
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,189
people that have come along over time

185
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,720
and now we've split off so we have an

186
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,120
app SEC app sick team and we have a

187
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,260
project team differences app SEC I'll

188
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,709
say assesses and educates and project

189
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,699
builds security features so to FA

190
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:47,819
web off in credit credential scanning a

191
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:50,819
one heard that we scan public repos for

192
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:52,589
like AWS tokens left hanging out things

193
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:55,740
like that they build those sorts of

194
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:57,660
features so that's more or less the

195
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,999
layout but but these are the people that

196
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,429
really deserve credit over time and

197
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:05,129
continuing to to build great things at

198
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,589
github for a knapsack perspective so if

199
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:10,019
you really want to go get lunch this is

200
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:12,600
the this is it this is this is the list

201
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,029
of things I think that makes a github

202
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,499
app SEC Fantasyland except for the one

203
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,420
weird trick that I'm gonna wait until

204
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,679
the end to tell you about but it's

205
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,509
actually kinda been mentioned in some

206
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,300
other presentations just not the exact

207
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,889
same way I'm going to mention it I feel

208
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,839
like I'm cutting in and out on this is

209
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,839
that do I need to hold it differently or

210
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:40,589
it's something might turn my head yeah

211
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:42,779
it's gonna be great for people listening

212
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:43,379
on YouTube is that better yeah there we

213
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,670
go alright

214
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:49,620
oh the messing up Monalisa here miss

215
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,769
Mona Lisa the octi cat by the way that's

216
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,029
her name our our mascot so that's a

217
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:55,439
that's an overlay but we're gonna talk

218
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,240
about here's another way to look at

219
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:59,189
things I'm gonna talk about the things

220
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,170
that make us that makes github app sick

221
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:02,670
Wonderland but there's things that we

222
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,929
still struggle with and some of these

223
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,360
things are you might look here and say

224
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,249
yeah we struggle with that too and I'll

225
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,709
tell you right now I don't have specific

226
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:12,839
slides on asset or domain inventory I'm

227
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:16,649
just gonna tell you that's a struggle

228
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,480
everywhere oh we have we're running

229
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,629
something on that domain oh that's still

230
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,839
hanging out there you know that that

231
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:26,459
custom app somebody built for this

232
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,660
specific event three years ago oh that's

233
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,729
still hanging out there and it's

234
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,389
connected to what yeah we struggle with

235
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,769
that too so here's here's some other

236
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:38,220
things we're gonna we're gonna talk

237
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:39,019
about and yes that is not a copy-paste

238
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,040
error

239
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,259
anyone running bug bound near been

240
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,670
involved in a bug bounty program so you

241
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:49,799
understand maybe understand this okay so

242
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,120
number one reason the well not the

243
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,529
number one reason but the first thing

244
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,270
I'm going to talk about is top-down

245
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,180
support

246
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,339
and Neil mannitol was supposed to give a

247
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,599
presentation and we talked about this he

248
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,899
wasn't able to give it but one of the

249
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,270
things we talked about was my threat

250
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,920
model is not your threat model of the

251
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,329
things I have to do don't necessary

252
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,130
apply to you if you work in retail you

253
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,980
probably have to run ads you have to

254
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:17,279
worry about performance if our page

255
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,050
loads if github loads a second slower

256
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:25,830
are you running over to get lab to use

257
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:26,880
it probably not right and we don't have

258
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,730
to regret our bitbucket

259
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,860
so we finally got we finally got Dave

260
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:35,899
off get bit buck no is he still a bit

261
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,339
bucket Justin I can't remember anyway

262
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,839
anyway the point is is is we're not

263
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,600
running ads remember sceneline a

264
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,140
headland github.com if you have then

265
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,339
something happened please let us know

266
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,990
because you shouldn't see that and so

267
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,180
that affects our threat model we don't

268
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,980
have to worry about that and the fact

269
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,859
that we have a Content security policy

270
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:59,339
in place that would eventually kill what

271
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,589
essentially killed most ads helps us so

272
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,720
that that gives that at bay we don't

273
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:06,320
know how long that'll last but we'll

274
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,940
take it for now

275
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,700
top-down support another point in town

276
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,500
top-down support this was posted when we

277
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,170
had an application security position

278
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,829
opening earlier in the year sorry it's

279
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:21,060
filled in case you're job hunting but

280
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:25,439
feel free to talk to me if you want to

281
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,779
network some for the future but you know

282
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,810
the recognition that that security and

283
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:34,620
trust is paramount and we need to do

284
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:37,109
that but whose company says that secure

285
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,120
anyone no companies that publicly say

286
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,000
security is important but internally a

287
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,000
little different

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,490
anyone ever experienced that yeah yeah

289
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,950
probably most of us from an internal

290
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,680
meeting NAT said I'm proud of the app

291
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,579
SEC reviews we're doing a CEO of a

292
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:59,520
company mentioned an app's tech review

293
00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:01,979
where does that happen AB SEC

294
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,730
fantasyland right it happens a knapsack

295
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,620
fantasy line and so we have a repo and

296
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,800
more about this everything on github is

297
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,889
done in github we dog food to the nth

298
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,740
degree so you can come and create an

299
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:19,170
issue for a knapsack review and we will

300
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,170
review your feature your your new app

301
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,899
your new service whatever and so so we

302
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,029
do that we work right in in github and

303
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:31,649
we do app set reviews and that's

304
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:35,160
recognized from the top down prod SEC

305
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:37,290
their ships are celebrated at universe

306
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,180
and satellite in case you don't know

307
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,160
universal satellite or events that

308
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,709
happened about every six months universe

309
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,329
is coming up in November satellite will

310
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:48,209
be in spring satellites usually in

311
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:50,399
Europe universe is in San Francisco it's

312
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,699
the big event github announces great big

313
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,889
features it's like a conference but our

314
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,439
security features get get celebrated

315
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,209
right along with hey we're doing actions

316
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,810
hey we're doing these other things that

317
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:05,550
github and so credential scanning to FA

318
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,930
you have often pwned passwords

319
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,670
integration they might know about the

320
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,300
panic pwned passwords integration what

321
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,160
that is anybody know about pwned

322
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,709
passwords

323
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:20,010
Troy hunt have I been poned look it up

324
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:23,279
you can download the list of compromised

325
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,959
passwords see if you can see if you can

326
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:30,870
use one of those compromised passwords

327
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:36,060
on github and it told you yeah and so

328
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:37,769
initially right yeah we think they

329
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,449
finally started enforcing originally it

330
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:41,490
was just we're gonna put this banner up

331
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,260
and annoy you until you change it now I

332
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,329
think they actually enforce it and force

333
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,769
you to change it we got a lot we a

334
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,269
little bit of backlash about some of

335
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,370
that B were like no stop telling me I

336
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:51,449
don't it won't for one funny story was

337
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,800
someone was like you're telling my

338
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,779
co-workers that I have a weak password

339
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,859
like there's an easy problems an easy

340
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:03,569
solution for this so that was literally

341
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,790
their complaint on Twitter okay and then

342
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:07,319
if you didn't know if you didn't see

343
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,688
this actually Mike's presenting later

344
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,720
today

345
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:15,689
we acquired simul which is a secure a

346
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,280
code analysis for security company and

347
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:21,010
we'll be integrating that as

348
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,119
github offering we haven't from an

349
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,859
internal perspective we haven't been

350
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,599
able to dog food it I wish I could talk

351
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:28,020
more about it I wish I had been able to

352
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,169
get my hands on it so far but

353
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,180
essentially we are we are bringing

354
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,100
bringing the tools to do code analysis

355
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,080
for security into as a github of

356
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,790
offering so pretty cool when you get

357
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,520
that level of top-down support this is

358
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:46,300
all about top-down support so what's the

359
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,900
downside of that most of us all of us in

360
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,060
github

361
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,820
you know apps X like what did I miss

362
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,620
who's gonna get a bounty on this right

363
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,520
what did I miss it's gonna show up in

364
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:01,899
the bounty bounty program anyway I do

365
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,870
pen testing here No so anyone know who

366
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,250
ed SCOTUS is so somewhat the sand shirt

367
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,159
you should know who it's go this is

368
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,190
let's go this has a great at least as I

369
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:16,930
heard this attributed to him he talked

370
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:19,720
about you get a pen test penetration

371
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:24,340
test and there's no findings are you

372
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,650
secure to your pen tester suck maybe

373
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,939
right but that's how we feel right I

374
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,060
didn't find anything

375
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,550
do I just suck right I'm no good I

376
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,320
didn't find any problems in the code and

377
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,240
so we struggle with that right impostor

378
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,220
syndrome I don't belong here

379
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,030
just a side note public service

380
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:45,070
announcement you know this is people who

381
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,100
get imposter syndrome other people who

382
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,379
get it and yeah all of us get it so so

383
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,240
you know it happens it github - we

384
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,640
struggle with that and it has happened

385
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,470
where we've done reviews and I'll talk

386
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,060
about it in a little bit where we will

387
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,140
remit something or we don't get to it

388
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,840
and it does show up in the bounty

389
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,870
program and and it's not easy it's a lot

390
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,010
of stress because well this is important

391
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,780
we're supported to do this right so I

392
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,160
didn't understand the 10x engineer

393
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:17,470
thread that ran around on Twitter while

394
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,540
ago name one see that anyway we're two X

395
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,520
engineers at github meaning if you do it

396
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,409
two times it's time to automate it and

397
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,120
so one of the things that makes OPSEC

398
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,850
github apps like Fantasyland is mature

399
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:35,529
engineering I gave as I spoke in

400
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:38,019
a separate webinar about this in my

401
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:41,830
advice if I come into a place to consult

402
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:43,389
and say what do you want to do to make

403
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,320
your secure your development lifecycle

404
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:49,269
secure first answer is mature your

405
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,850
development lifecycle get away from

406
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:54,880
works on my box doesn't work on your box

407
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,590
right get your automation down get your

408
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,450
unit testing down get your integration

409
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:04,110
testing down get your functional testing

410
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:08,309
down authorization tests right ozzie

411
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:11,080
automated tests right this was this was

412
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:13,450
just another software engineer at github

413
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,509
we didn't do this we didn't work with

414
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,909
this it just showed up on an internal we

415
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:21,610
call it team there's a like an internal

416
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:23,559
blog to get hub and this showed up one

417
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:27,209
day someone's like I improved writing

418
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:29,950
authorization tests you're welcome

419
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:35,950
and we're like this is amazing it's ABS

420
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:37,450
act Fantasyland right so but the

421
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,399
struggle then is you get mature

422
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:43,929
engineering things happen faster right

423
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:46,029
so we get mature Imagineering we can

424
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:48,159
reproduce problems we have automated

425
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:51,820
tests we have confidence in our deploys

426
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,799
things really start to move fast and so

427
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,750
we struggled to keep up with it right

428
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:59,350
and we don't always get apps or services

429
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:01,029
or future reviewed and hit I want to

430
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,620
chat more about that Justin the whole

431
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:07,539
concept you had in your presentation

432
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:09,039
about reviews and peer reviewing but I

433
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:10,990
would say this the example I want to

434
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,500
give is a peer review because prod sec

435
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:18,990
wrote a security feature anyone anyone

436
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:21,970
see that we shipped organizations can be

437
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,799
ssh certain authorities and you can

438
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,940
require that for commits in your

439
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:31,149
organization okay so if you have an

440
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:34,720
Oregon github you can require you can

441
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:37,620
become an SSH Sirte thority for your

442
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,260
organization and you can sign

443
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,809
certificates and issue certificates for

444
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,080
people in your organization they have to

445
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:49,510
have

446
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:52,689
that that see it your CA issued cert to

447
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:55,030
commit code I can issue them for one day

448
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,650
and then I show you another one for one

449
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:01,899
day so I can kind of like a let's

450
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:04,300
encrypt model so Project Engineer wrote

451
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,560
that up ssh is pretty solid the

452
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,840
components on that are pretty solid

453
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,310
right so that went to the bottom of my

454
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,449
review pile because i had other things

455
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:16,149
to get done and it stayed at the bottom

456
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:19,480
of my review pile and then they shipped

457
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,180
it and then a bounty submitter found an

458
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,370
issue with the management interface

459
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,230
pretty simple problem but i didn't get

460
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,040
to it because there was a lot to do and

461
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,430
i thought yeah project guy wrote that

462
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,639
we're good

463
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:35,620
that's solid right and so you know we

464
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,220
struggle with that just the the the

465
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,840
shipping security at scale and speed and

466
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,880
keeping up with that and we're not

467
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,949
officially a blocker in many cases like

468
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,920
i said this didn't get us an app sec

469
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:51,220
review before it shipped and so

470
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,560
sometimes that means we miss things

471
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,300
other times it's perceived that we are a

472
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,100
blocker and we're pressured into it

473
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,899
because we do want to review things

474
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,659
before they go out and so that's a

475
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,220
struggle like like many places like seth

476
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,430
talked about in the clip you know you've

477
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:11,380
got three people four hundred apps

478
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:14,470
they're all high priority right so same

479
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,730
buddies company hire rockstars anybody

480
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,310
work with a company and says we hire

481
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,650
rockstars you've seen that right we hire

482
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,620
rockstar developers or whatever well

483
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:26,140
this is a great thing a github is we we

484
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,669
prefer janitors over rock stars janitors

485
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,040
get their hands dirty they clean up

486
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,880
messes they take on difficult tasks they

487
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,710
do the jobs people don't want to do

488
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,800
anyone ever dealt with OAuth code from a

489
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:41,370
review or a writing perspective you're

490
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,370
lucky okay

491
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:49,960
Omaha is a nasty complex thing to code

492
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:52,720
to implement to get right and so you

493
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,670
know Liz feminists Diaz her her handle I

494
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,850
think pretty much everywhere she said

495
00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,590
and that's her it's also her Abbott

496
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:03,389
are everywhere the sloth in a and a cup

497
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,100
you know and she took that on she just

498
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,070
came in and said you know this needs

499
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,409
doing I'm gonna do it and so this makes

500
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:15,270
you know these issues get hung out and

501
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:19,220
what happens anyone done consulting like

502
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:21,510
a security consulting you do the review

503
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,610
right and there's a finding and you come

504
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:27,090
back for the next annual review and the

505
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,740
finding is so they're right so this

506
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,879
wasn't a finding but it was an issue

507
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,970
that was hanging out that needed

508
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,990
addressing and it got done right because

509
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,810
janitors are better than rock stars

510
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:39,660
because rock stars trash your room right

511
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,760
and throw a fit the janitor comes in and

512
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,510
cleans it up wait we want janitors not

513
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:49,170
rock stars and your wall was much better

514
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,730
than mine Justin we don't lob things

515
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,160
over the wall github and I think this

516
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,210
was very high on the list of why it's AB

517
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,660
sec fantasy land

518
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,860
there's no lobbying hand over the wall I

519
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:02,610
see got on a call yesterday with a

520
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,040
developer they want to do an integration

521
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,000
with a partner on something and we sat

522
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,790
and worked out the problem together

523
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,230
right we sat we got on the call and he

524
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:13,500
showed me what he was working on and he

525
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:15,780
showed me this error message and content

526
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,640
security policy was blocking him right

527
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,379
and I'm like okay well this is why and

528
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,970
let's let's talk about other options of

529
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,930
how we can do this or if there's a way

530
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,610
to get when you call it an exception in

531
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,350
place for this and I said you know bars

532
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,389
are bars pretty high for a set of

533
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,980
exceptions but you know let's let's look

534
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,900
at all the options and so we don't lob

535
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,960
things we work in issues we work in pull

536
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,920
requests we work in repos all together

537
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,320
dogfooding

538
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,470
within github and so that makes it a

539
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,850
great place to work with developers

540
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:48,630
sounds fantastic right dreamy right

541
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,080
anybody want to guess what the downside

542
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,080
is

543
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:59,269
notification bankruptcy right so high

544
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:04,039
when you work with all the deaths you

545
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:06,349
work with all the Deb's right we anyone

546
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:09,229
used mentions I mean we use mentions in

547
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:12,859
github so we can at github slash app SEC

548
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:14,929
internally that is us as a team or you

549
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:17,779
individually I might get an app misfire

550
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:19,669
and hey can you look at this hey can you

551
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:23,539
review this or I've got a question about

552
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:26,529
this and you know email and then we get

553
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:29,960
all the email about that from github and

554
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:34,869
yeah anyway so yeah notification

555
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,869
bankruptcy yeah it can be overwhelming

556
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,249
[Music]

557
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,739
so you again this was something that was

558
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:45,710
mentioned in at least two talks possibly

559
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:49,669
three today I've I've come across tuned

560
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:54,320
and automated sassed security static

561
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:56,059
analysis security testing so if you've

562
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,859
done application security for any time

563
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:02,090
or you've use sassed you've probably

564
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:05,149
seen the run run the stock SAS product

565
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:07,939
on some large code base generate one

566
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:12,590
thousand pages of mostly false positives

567
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:16,190
right lots of noise little use okay

568
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:20,649
so must be tuned it must be automated we

569
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:24,440
run we run this and these are automated

570
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:27,289
actually Sentinel that's the user that

571
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,659
does it and Sentinel will drop a comment

572
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,429
in the issue and will say hey looks like

573
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:35,289
you're it's like Clippy right but

574
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:39,320
tougher all right if I remember Clippy

575
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:41,090
so Clippy but much tougher right so say

576
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,320
hey it looks like you're changing you

577
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,939
want to change the content security

578
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,428
policy looks like you're trying to do

579
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,460
this and then we'll link them off to a

580
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:51,109
guide if we have it about like what they

581
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,869
might want to consider or how to do that

582
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:59,029
securely etc one of the things we look

583
00:27:53,869 --> 00:28:02,570
for for example is in in concerns about

584
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:04,669
server side request forgery SS RF we

585
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,600
look for HTTP client connections

586
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:07,669
outbound

587
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,159
and so we get a notification and it

588
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:13,940
drops a comment about that do we get

589
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,480
false positives yes are they easy for us

590
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,789
to triage yes do we also get some true

591
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,760
positives yes and that's where the bang

592
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:25,940
for buck really comes in until we run

593
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,710
break man on Ruby on Rails opinionated

594
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,710
framework break man works well for that

595
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:33,500
we have customized components of break

596
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,350
man and then we do a lot of reg Xing

597
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,780
quite simply right we just say if we see

598
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:41,090
this in the code we want to look at that

599
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:45,799
for two seconds and we can usually

600
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:48,379
triage it right so automated and tuned

601
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,960
this happens basically on every PR on

602
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,360
every pull request that comes in to the

603
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,490
you saw the reference the monolith

604
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:01,850
anybody want to guess what the monolith

605
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:04,070
is it's github.com it's the main product

606
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,799
right so it's the large code base that

607
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:10,399
is the monolith so this runs regularly

608
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,340
on github.com code but our struggle is

609
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:19,220
oh there's much shinier things than Ruby

610
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:20,389
on Rails right so there's golang if you

611
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,460
hadn't heard we were acquired by

612
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:28,760
Microsoft so we might be using Azure

613
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:30,890
some may be AWS we have github actions

614
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,419
now which is hey run your own code over

615
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,460
here in the sandbox and hopefully we're

616
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,230
safe right so there's all kinds of stuff

617
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,730
we have to worry about that that we

618
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:41,289
still have to learn how to tune and

619
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:47,809
automate and look at to alert us on

620
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:49,370
you'll notice no c-sharp though so all

621
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:51,080
right so this is this is another thing I

622
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,989
think that's great about github and I

623
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,360
think Greg OSA my boss is a really does

624
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:59,080
a great job with this security

625
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,389
absolutism right I remember sitting in

626
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,399
as a software engineer my 15 ish years

627
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,260
as a software engineer anyone sat in a

628
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,250
meeting and like we have these eight

629
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:16,158
tasks and this guy literally was like h

630
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:19,470
h h h for what high priority

631
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,110
everything was in h by the time he was

632
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,840
everything was an age high priority if

633
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,729
everything's high priority

634
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,350
nothing's high priority so we have to do

635
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,860
that in security right you have to care

636
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,480
about certain things you know and dan

637
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,879
Cornell I think earlier today talked

638
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,269
about this he got a great perspective on

639
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:42,389
it the business is risk right we often

640
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:45,179
worry about information security risk

641
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:46,408
but what about the businesses risk right

642
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,980
you have to think about the business

643
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:53,720
risk if we stop to fix absolutely every

644
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:56,070
little security potential security bug

645
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,860
we're gonna slow down until we're out of

646
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:02,220
existence right so what do we care about

647
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,779
we care about authorization issues we we

648
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,460
care about cross-site scripting we don't

649
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,200
think it's just solved we've just put a

650
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,970
lot of work into it and so we have a

651
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,429
pretty good handle on it now we really

652
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:17,129
do care right we watch for it

653
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:18,570
so and I and I've told my son this a few

654
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:21,149
times recently anyone have children

655
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,590
teenage children especially you end up

656
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:25,408
in these all-or-nothing grudge matches

657
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:27,418
right or it's I want this at no

658
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:30,629
compromise and I told my son I tell them

659
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:32,850
I told him a number of times recently if

660
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:35,668
you go about all or nothing you're gonna

661
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:40,529
end up with a lot of nothing right and

662
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:41,639
so can't be security absolutist bounties

663
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:43,139
all right

664
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:46,309
so who is my who's one who's that who

665
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:50,449
has improved my bounty people in here

666
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:50,450
what's your favorite part of the bounty

667
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,570
yeah it's kind of nice like say hey you

668
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,500
found something good here somebody

669
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,139
what's your what's your least favorite

670
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:12,800
part about the bounty this why do I

671
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:14,420
outsource my presentations yeah yeah so

672
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,760
and so the great thing about bounty you

673
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,610
notice I had you know wonderland

674
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,200
bounties struggle bounties right and so

675
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:23,689
bounties are great my first week at

676
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,270
github 10,000 bounty 20,000 bounty I

677
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:30,170
watched them happen because problems got

678
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:32,210
solved not publicly right we handled it

679
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,330
early that problem came up early we

680
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:37,460
dealt with it we rewarded the bounty

681
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:40,070
submitter and we moved on right I

682
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,460
awarded about a month or two ago I

683
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:46,100
warded $42,000 in bounties Fred came in

684
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,260
from over the weekend again I'm not

685
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,850
gonna tell you what it was I can't but

686
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,410
those problems were solved and that's

687
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,540
the great thing I don't have to tell you

688
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,940
about it it's not one Krebbs on security

689
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:59,450
on the front page so that's the wonder

690
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,850
of bounties and you get talent that you

691
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,640
get and I don't have to pay anyone until

692
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,770
they find that right once they find it

693
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,900
it's good we pay them I don't have to

694
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:11,750
pay for the extra forty hours they spent

695
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:14,120
not finding something but we pay them

696
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:16,250
for what they found and then we get to

697
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,439
triage and so that's great so let me

698
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,540
walk you quickly through just just the

699
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,130
anatomy of how a bounty works at github

700
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,700
because I think it's I think this is

701
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:28,460
useful we chat off a lot anybody else do

702
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,530
chat ups know what anybody know what

703
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,910
they might want to know what chat Ops is

704
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:35,960
I'll pause for a second okay great I

705
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,060
please stop I should have said this

706
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,450
earlier if I throw out some term and

707
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:44,020
it's there like what please stop me is

708
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:47,060
you see I have no problem interacting

709
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:51,950
too much often so I'm watching my clock

710
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:54,379
here because yeah I got lunch still so

711
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,260
chat up is the concept of like any when

712
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,870
you slack do you use slack okay so you

713
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,760
can wire up slack essentially to listen

714
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,919
for something and then send off a

715
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,820
request elsewhere and then it would does

716
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,179
work that's the short way to put it

717
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,949
right so essentially we we give slack a

718
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:15,290
command in this case it would be dot

719
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:19,699
bounty and then I tell it triage it or

720
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,699
give it an info response which means

721
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:24,509
yeah that's helpful but no we're not

722
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:30,569
gonna pay you and then it closed it so

723
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:33,419
if I do bounty info the the submission

724
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:35,429
ID and then we have like canned messages

725
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:38,308
we can optionally send a canned message

726
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:40,710
to them and so what happens is we chat

727
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:43,109
up so a bounty comes in let's say and I

728
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:45,659
look at and I take whatever time it

729
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:47,819
takes me sometimes short sometimes long

730
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,480
there's the downside of some of the

731
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:54,210
bounties and I say yes this is real this

732
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,649
is valid right so we need to we need to

733
00:34:54,210 --> 00:35:00,180
look into this we need to create an

734
00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:03,509
issue so I would dot bounty triage the

735
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:05,609
bounty ID and then I'd pick the repo

736
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,290
it's gonna go into and github and it

737
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:10,619
will create an issue in that repo and

738
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:13,640
github I'll go in I'll go in will click

739
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:16,410
the link into that issue from slack and

740
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,410
then I will comment a little more

741
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,450
usually like I tested this I think this

742
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,180
is where the code is that's causing it I

743
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,740
might have already found the code I

744
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,299
might have tested another scenario on

745
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,098
top of the one the bounty submitter gave

746
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:32,030
me and I'll add a little more commentary

747
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:34,290
to the India issue of what's going on

748
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,849
and then I will typically mention

749
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,529
whatever team has responsibility I'll

750
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:39,869
find what team has responsibility for

751
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,359
that area I'll at them and then that is

752
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:44,309
my issue to work with them right so I

753
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:47,848
work that issue to the end till it's

754
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:49,890
fixed and sometimes before it's fixed

755
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:51,780
but oftentimes after we then will pay

756
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,650
the bounty submitter and again the

757
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:58,170
bounty that's dot bounty payout bounty

758
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:01,170
bounty issue ID and the amount I'm gonna

759
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,849
send them all right and yes we whitelist

760
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:06,869
the amounts we send them so if you had

761
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:10,859
an extra zero because because that is

762
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:12,390
it's an issue right so so we chat off

763
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,950
all of that meaning basically we

764
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,558
automate it so I can just do it right

765
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:18,689
from slack I don't have to go into 20

766
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,390
different systems to do it

767
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,310
and that's one of the that goes back to

768
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,040
the mature engineering aspect right we

769
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,410
all chat up it at github like every team

770
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,290
does and so it's a culture of doing that

771
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:34,170
it's an automation it helps vastly

772
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:36,090
because those tanya talked about toil

773
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,130
right if you were in there she talked

774
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,200
about toil something else that makes

775
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,720
github app sec Fantasyland is we don't

776
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,750
have we do have some of the toil but a

777
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,589
lot of it has has been been handled that

778
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:52,500
way so we run that we're comment the the

779
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:55,410
the absolute Fantasyland story in this

780
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,630
was I got a submission it was cross-site

781
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,339
scripting but it was low risk because it

782
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,890
was not it wouldn't have it wouldn't

783
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,840
affect github.com it didn't have your

784
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,700
github session it wouldn't have been

785
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:09,180
related to your github session and he in

786
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,970
any way I created the issue I added the

787
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,040
I mentioned the the responsible team and

788
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,620
I think I mentioned a specific developer

789
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,230
who had worked on a similar issue she

790
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:23,970
came in she fixed it we verified it we

791
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:26,220
deployed it in three hours so that's the

792
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,790
absolute you know Wonderland story for

793
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,169
that and that yeah and that and that was

794
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,290
an amazing experience

795
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,630
um the downside though we have someone

796
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,970
who's written blogs complaining because

797
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,500
we didn't accept their submission they

798
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:44,399
also deleted their blog in like two

799
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,870
hours after they posted it but kind of

800
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,330
weird but yeah we have that back and

801
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,859
forth because inherently there is

802
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,900
competing interests in your bounty

803
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,970
program the submitter wants that

804
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,070
security absolutism they want the

805
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,140
low-risk issues to be seen as high risk

806
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:00,270
so they can get paid out and so they can

807
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,339
get their reputation because reputation

808
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,780
is also a currency on bounty programs

809
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,270
and understand that if you're looking

810
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,610
into one they want their signal there's

811
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,320
there's two things reputation and signal

812
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,510
and some people are very particular

813
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,630
about the reputation and signal in those

814
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:18,270
programs so that's the the downside of

815
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,890
the bounties right and I and I should

816
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:25,460
have clicked forward to this at that

817
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:28,970
point right so bow me please right

818
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:33,550
I went seeing that the clip which like

819
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:36,950
money please so anyway so that is the

820
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:39,080
that's the upside and downside of bounty

821
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,700
programs in terms of abstract Wonderland

822
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,930
so what are we doing to make it more

823
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,029
wonderful I'm going to hit on a couple

824
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,770
things that still at the end that that I

825
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,770
think make it wonderful that one weird

826
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:50,480
trick included but the automation and

827
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:53,270
the chat hopping that I that I've talked

828
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,800
about right so walk over here so when

829
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:59,360
when I create a bounty issue it puts a

830
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,680
label on that issue that it was bounty

831
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,320
it also puts an issue on it those

832
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,730
security I can run a separate command

833
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,550
that says dot vuln or dot bounty I think

834
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,200
we Elias at both ways and it says I put

835
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:16,190
in the github issue and then I put in

836
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:19,520
the severity high on this one so it puts

837
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:21,380
in our security high label right and on

838
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,540
top of that and I think this this is one

839
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:26,120
of so much here since we started doing

840
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,850
this just in the last several months we

841
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,730
say high severity target time to fix

842
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:34,069
this is not contractual no one from the

843
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,240
top down said hey when security tells

844
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,980
you it's high this is how you have to

845
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,069
fix it we're just saying this is one we

846
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,870
think it should be fixed and we find

847
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,340
that developers go you're right we

848
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,470
should get to that we should fix that

849
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,660
and then there's a little note about why

850
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:52,310
what are examples of high severity

851
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:56,120
issues so sentinel sea sentinel drops

852
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:59,029
this issue in for its and comments on it

853
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:03,170
and that helps a lot so just for the

854
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:05,630
record our issues are or our our

855
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:09,800
severity czar since the low medium high

856
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:13,670
critical times are ours one day one week

857
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,170
and then negotiable but we don't want to

858
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,780
let it go past two months and we'll set

859
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,340
a reminder to follow up on it so for low

860
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,290
issues we don't really bother with

861
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:24,790
informational issues we might I think

862
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:29,750
it's officially a level but we rarely

863
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:31,509
they're hardly worth an issue bounties

864
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:36,490
again we are cultivating relationships

865
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:39,609
with top security researchers

866
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:43,118
this is from the hacker 1-7 h1 702 event

867
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:46,690
it's co-located to Def Con hacker one

868
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,940
puts on a life hacking event Verizon

869
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,160
github other companies participate in it

870
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:56,470
where they actually bring the hackers in

871
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:59,770
live and they bring them in live and and

872
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:02,049
we get to work with them hands on

873
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:05,050
I haven't participated in one yet but

874
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:07,839
it's a lot of work it's a lot of work

875
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,520
it's like a long long day cuz you know

876
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,779
the stereotypical hacker works until

877
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,390
like 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning right

878
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,680
yeah that actually happens here I don't

879
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,660
think it's just because of stereotypes

880
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,910
it's just because it's a compressed time

881
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:22,629
scheduled to do this but the other

882
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:24,580
aspect to bounties and if you if you

883
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,440
decide to go on a bounty program and you

884
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:29,950
don't learn from your bounty submitters

885
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,800
you're missing out that example of the

886
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:36,009
SSH Sirte thority review where I didn't

887
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,339
get to it in time and someone submitted

888
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:42,010
a bounty even though I hadn't got to it

889
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:43,690
I said well we reverse engineered and

890
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,970
said how did this person find this so

891
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:47,440
fast and we thought they probably have

892
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:50,500
these three this thing on their

893
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,720
checklist so we added that thing to our

894
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,700
checklist and said when you're reviewing

895
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,770
make sure you double-check that simple

896
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,319
check it was sam'l related I'll tell you

897
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:01,300
that much and so we said hey you know if

898
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:05,170
something sam'l protected make sure you

899
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,820
do this check all right so if you run a

900
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,950
bounty program and you're not learning

901
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,140
from your from your top submitters

902
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:13,810
you're missing out on something take the

903
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,700
opportunity whether or not you missed it

904
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:17,619
or however they got the submission got

905
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,720
there take the opportunity to think how

906
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:23,460
did the bounty submitter find that how

907
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:29,740
can I add that into my own repertoire of

908
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:31,570
of checks to do ok so I think we're

909
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,779
getting pretty close um

910
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,670
paved paths and I think Justin mentioned

911
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,910
this in a better way in his presentation

912
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:42,550
that is api's that are secure by default

913
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:45,279
example code that's secure by default we

914
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:48,010
had a conversation we had a series a few

915
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,710
weeks where we did chats with other app

916
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,880
sect teams for

917
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:54,400
from a number of companies but one of

918
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,050
those was Netflix and Netflix very

919
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,650
interesting when they look at the app

920
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:01,330
security of an application to measure it

921
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:03,910
they look at the percentage of paved

922
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:06,310
paths Ness that's their primary thing

923
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,420
that they look at are you using the pay

924
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,830
of paths that have been put out there

925
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:13,000
and I'm like that's a great that's

926
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:15,460
that's wonderful you know so so that's

927
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,660
something we're working on when I say

928
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,850
we're working on it it means literally

929
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,399
we're not there yet it's something we're

930
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:23,950
working on and this is a continual thing

931
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,050
right obligatory all the things right

932
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:29,080
automate and chat ops all the things

933
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,210
right all the things that are repeatable

934
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:35,049
mundane that you don't want to do

935
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:36,940
manually multiple times and so one of

936
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,800
those things is the over notification

937
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,600
that I mentioned earlier that's one of

938
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,440
the things that I'm eventually going to

939
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,690
get to is a better job of automating

940
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,250
awareness essentially what we should be

941
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,620
looking at and what we can kind of

942
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,480
ignore what's been sitting for a long

943
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:56,190
time what just happened

944
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:00,070
so we can be involved in those things

945
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:01,540
all right you know only two slides I

946
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:05,110
think I'm doing pretty good there might

947
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,340
be hope for lunch yet is there any

948
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,650
questions up to this point by the way I

949
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:16,180
meant to stop earlier any questions or

950
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:18,250
comments this is the best part no I'm

951
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,440
not done I'm just pausing quickly before

952
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:22,410
I get through my last two slides are

953
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,780
there any questions or comments thus far

954
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,730
okay I do actually have if you at the

955
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:31,060
end after the next two slides you have a

956
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:34,350
good question I think I have some get to

957
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:38,350
github wireless chargers phone chargers

958
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:41,890
I just I just ended up with two extras

959
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:43,779
so from a company thing so if you'd like

960
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,730
one asked me a good question or make a

961
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:51,930
comment at the end just flatter me

962
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:54,930
really that's all I ask no don't please

963
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,930
so

964
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:03,400
yep he's just lost so thank you but you

965
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,900
did that does not gonna qualify so it

966
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,700
all comes back to good people if you

967
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,859
ever hire if you ever interview to come

968
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,450
place and you ask what why should I work

969
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:11,859
here or what makes this company great

970
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:16,058
and it'll say something about the team

971
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:17,799
or the people they really should write

972
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:19,119
and so that's one of the things that

973
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,559
made github apps like Phoenix and I

974
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,260
mentioned this earlier these are great

975
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:27,910
people that I work with talented smart

976
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,920
humble you know like I said I don't want

977
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:32,140
to say that you know we're not ëletís

978
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,119
right there's been some hard work that's

979
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:37,259
gone in there's some good good outcomes

980
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:40,900
but good people make all the difference

981
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:43,030
so the one weird trick the one thing I

982
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,400
think that number one thing I think that

983
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:47,020
makes github app sec Fantasyland you

984
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,710
probably weren't guessing it maybe you

985
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:52,569
were empathy this is a written down

986
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:55,809
formally written down part of your

987
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:58,680
orientation core value at github so when

988
00:45:55,809 --> 00:46:00,970
they talk about core values that github

989
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,240
empathy is one of those others include

990
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:06,609
things like product improvement quality

991
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,770
shipping collaboration right things yeah

992
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:11,109
we want to do good work we want quality

993
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,400
those sorts of things but I this is the

994
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:16,210
first company I worked at where they

995
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,670
said empathy is a core value and why

996
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:21,400
does that make a difference in half sec

997
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:23,799
right because it helps us build trust

998
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,270
with the developers no-one's ever worked

999
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:29,460
in a place where the developers avoid

1000
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:32,650
security right developers avoid security

1001
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,270
right and it does so empathy helps us

1002
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,460
build trust with developers we're not

1003
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:38,710
scared they're not scared of us when I

1004
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,599
sat down when I had the video chat

1005
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:43,750
yesterday with developer he said no my

1006
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,490
he said my my my interactions with

1007
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,680
security have been generally positive so

1008
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:49,479
he had no reason to avoid me I had

1009
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,578
another one where when we came one there

1010
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,920
kind of like what I didn't know what I

1011
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:55,359
don't oh that wasn't bad like that

1012
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,520
wasn't as bad as I thought it would be

1013
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:00,790
right so obviously this person has had

1014
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,210
bad experiences with security and you

1015
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:06,640
know and but we were able and so if we

1016
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,589
can build that trust internally and

1017
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,920
he is a key way for us to do that we

1018
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:15,390
build that trust internally the

1019
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:19,210
developers won't avoid us and in the end

1020
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:23,049
we all want really to build trust able

1021
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:25,480
software right and so this enables that

1022
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:28,538
if we have empathy and we work with the

1023
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,609
developers some have some have seen the

1024
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:33,460
mean you know developers or friend not

1025
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:34,839
food with the Finding Nemo shark right

1026
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,760
and that's it

1027
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:38,799
developers are your friend I was a

1028
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,349
developer so I have I have a great deal

1029
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:42,880
of empathy I know what they do to day to

1030
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:45,130
day and so I think this is the number

1031
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,359
one thing and this actually was this

1032
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,950
morning

1033
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:51,098
this was the developer I spoke with

1034
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:53,348
yesterday because his problem was

1035
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:59,680
content security policy and we could

1036
00:47:53,349 --> 00:48:01,119
have just told him what no no you can't

1037
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,480
make an exception to content security

1038
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,910
policy but Oreo shake neo mannitol has

1039
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,279
done work such that we have a way to do

1040
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,049
it safely and scope it properly and so

1041
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:15,339
we've supported them doing that and so

1042
00:48:11,049 --> 00:48:18,220
because we have empathy we're able to

1043
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:20,170
make that win and so if we do that I

1044
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,910
believe that is the number one thing

1045
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,250
that makes github apps that Fantasyland

1046
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:30,000
and thank you

1047
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:30,000
[Applause]

1048
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,040
you
