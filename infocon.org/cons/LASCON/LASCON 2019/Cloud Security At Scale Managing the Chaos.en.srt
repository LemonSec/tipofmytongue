1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:36,500
[Music]

2
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,410
not everyone would call it professionals

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,570
but that's what we wrote down so cool

4
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,349
well thank you guys for thank you all

5
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,489
for coming out

6
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,859
appreciate it this is pretty good

7
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:49,099
turnout for cloud security talk at a AB

8
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:51,050
SEC conference I appreciate that

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,690
so yeah diving into this is cloud

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:01:00,140
security at scale so what are we talking

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,760
about so Ken and I have had similar

12
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,260
careers but we've also done some

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,320
different things we both started out in

14
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,420
application security we moved into both

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,729
blue team and doing more consulting and

16
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,490
then we've got more into clouds through

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,410
the past few years so we you know we

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,240
talked about cumber experiences you know

19
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,289
war stories all those things and we

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,119
talked about some of the things that

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,620
we'd seen at different financial

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,470
companies that we'd worked either with

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,210
or in and we realize there's a lot of

24
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,400
similarities and we should put a talk

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,470
together about that and kind of share

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,640
our experiences our wins our losses all

27
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:44,570
those kinds of things that's what

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:46,970
started this talk so as I said I'm a ab

29
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,949
sec and cloud security consultant so I

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,390
spend most of my time working with

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,150
clients and trying to help them solve

32
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,890
their their issues I've done an absolute

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,310
for a long time and now moved more into

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:01,190
cloud security the past few years I've

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,720
worked with small consultant sorry small

36
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,730
startup companies with you know very

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,039
small cloud footprint and also some

38
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,599
pretty large financials that you know

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,879
pushing the edges of what you can do in

40
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:14,689
AWS I have I've seen kind of both sides

41
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,429
of things and then on my side of the

42
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:17,090
fence I started out in consulting and

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,220
then once

44
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,959
a staff security for a long time and

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,220
doing the blue team thing and this is

46
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,890
sort of what my life looked like for a

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,629
really long time I spent you know I took

48
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,569
some that consulting experience ran a

49
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,920
security program and so while Mike's was

50
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,149
saying you know our experiences have

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,470
differed we've run into a lot of the

52
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,280
same challenges handled him a little bit

53
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,569
differently and had a different

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,370
perspective on each of them so hopefully

55
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:39,369
we can take you through some of those

56
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,730
so we structured the sock in kind of

57
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,110
three pieces so as I talked about we

58
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,459
worked with different financials over

59
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,780
times we took three examples of

60
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,970
companies we worked with and they're

61
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,799
kind of they're not all you know this

62
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,329
isn't this isn't necessarily real all

63
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:01,790
real companies but it's experiences from

64
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,170
different places so we set up a few

65
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,179
different stories and yes these are

66
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,250
Simpsons references if you don't get

67
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,340
that the stories are real the names have

68
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,319
been changed to you know but but yeah

69
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,610
we're we're bringing our experience in

70
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,410
trying to see what this looks like in

71
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,610
the real world yeah and what's

72
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,349
interesting is all three are in

73
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,299
different places in their cloud journey

74
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:21,858
they're also slightly different

75
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,180
companies but they're all financials so

76
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:25,190
they all deal with a lot of the same

77
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,799
issues but at different scales and

78
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,250
they're different places in the in the

79
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,549
process so some of the themes that we

80
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,250
saw across all these companies was

81
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:40,250
complexity that might seem pretty

82
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,630
straightforward but complexity we had

83
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,190
that issue on Prem and now we're moving

84
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,160
to the cloud where everything moves much

85
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,840
faster and so complexity happens very

86
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,739
quickly when you're trying to move into

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,389
the cloud and so that was true in small

88
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,209
companies and large companies but it was

89
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:58,370
much worse than large companies all

90
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,530
three had a foot in both worlds as in

91
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,819
they had on Prem infrastructure they

92
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,349
were not you know that they weren't born

93
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:05,298
in the cloud so they had on Prem

94
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,130
infrastructure they're still maintaining

95
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,930
a lot of their business ran off on prime

96
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,230
infrastructure and they're trying to

97
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,630
adapt security to the cloud most of them

98
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,130
had a pretty mature on Prem security

99
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,238
presence but you know now they have to

100
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:24,229
adapt that to the cloud so start things

101
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:26,989
off Bart's banking so this was this was

102
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:30,849
a company that there is a company they

103
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,889
can go under anything that they they

104
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:36,219
the cloud for five plus years which in

105
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:39,159
cloud terms is a very long time they

106
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:41,860
started before AWS was anything like it

107
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:44,289
is now and they have a very large

108
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,449
infrastructure so you know hundreds of

109
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:49,688
thousands of applications hundreds of

110
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:52,300
AWS accounts tons and tons of workloads

111
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:55,929
and so they're kind of the bleeding edge

112
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,089
of doing cloud with Orion of financial

113
00:04:55,929 --> 00:05:00,549
and so thinking about what cloud

114
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:02,139
maturity looks like for pretty much any

115
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,899
company I kind of think of it as a few

116
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,550
different things so everyone is probably

117
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,319
familiar with the OODA loop but it's you

118
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,699
know the whole idea of being able to get

119
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,550
your bearings and then making decisions

120
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,110
and then acting on those decisions so a

121
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,909
lot of companies struggle with even the

122
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,159
basics with these kinds of things so if

123
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:20,589
you have thousands of apps hundreds of

124
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:22,688
accounts you know are you even able to

125
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:25,059
know what's out there you're able to

126
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:27,519
observe what's going on then can you you

127
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:29,499
know Orion figure out who owns what how

128
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,959
to fix something and then actually act

129
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:34,089
and do it so this is an example of a

130
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,469
company who over many years was able to

131
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:37,329
do that that was kind of the material

132
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,649
that they built over time through a lot

133
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:40,719
of hard work it wasn't it wasn't

134
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:42,519
anything simple but that was kind of a

135
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:44,589
sign of maturity that I saw was that

136
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,509
even though this is relatively basic

137
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:48,849
this isn't machine learning security

138
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,079
this isn't a I fix insecurity this is a

139
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,789
level maturity that we didn't see

140
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,909
everywhere else but that's because they

141
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:57,878
had years of experience doing this

142
00:05:53,909 --> 00:06:00,519
so getting to complexity so in the

143
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,459
beginning they had a pretty simple set

144
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,459
of workloads and in the cloud you know

145
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:09,459
what we all know is kind of the

146
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:11,379
three-tier web applications nothing too

147
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:13,689
crazy using a few different AWS services

148
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:15,610
they were using things back in the day

149
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:18,429
before even some of those services that

150
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,229
most people use now we're around so it

151
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:23,708
was relatively simple but that grew over

152
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:25,209
time so in the middle you know more more

153
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:28,869
and more move to the cloud more apps

154
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:32,469
more accounts more users things got more

155
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:34,240
complex so using more and more more and

156
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:36,550
more services and you can see the

157
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,379
interconnectivity and then where things

158
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,709
are today

159
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:43,209
it's where things are today not to say

160
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,500
it's a total train wreck but if you

161
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:47,050
looked at it you wouldn't necessarily

162
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,370
No you know what's going on it's hard to

163
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,610
reason about what the infrastructure

164
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:55,020
looks like and so this is you know the

165
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,340
chief architect of the cloud and the

166
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,659
thing I like to say is at every big

167
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,039
company there's probably one or two

168
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,270
people in a basement somewhere who

169
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,680
actually know how everything works

170
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,750
everyone else just has to go to them and

171
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,550
ask questions and they look like him

172
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:11,740
because they're driven crazy by how you

173
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,810
know complex everything is so yeah

174
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,470
complexity is my word of the day

175
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,810
because it it makes operations more

176
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,190
difficult it makes deployment more

177
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,380
difficult but it especially makes

178
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,600
security more difficult because if you

179
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,040
don't know how things work if you don't

180
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,020
know how to networks are talking if you

181
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,190
don't know what access someone has how

182
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,740
do you work through and secure those

183
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,630
things so that's a it's a huge issue

184
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,220
when you get into the cloud because it's

185
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,020
easy you know you can spin up a new

186
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,000
account in 15 minutes and have that

187
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,120
talking to your production you know VP

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,770
sees in you know 20 minutes so how do

189
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,470
you do a fennec ation and authorization

190
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,820
at scale when you're doing so much in

191
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,010
the cloud

192
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,930
another issue is on Prem the cloud

193
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,020
access this company

194
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,970
bart's banking you know they they were

195
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,590
cloud centric so everything was being

196
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,729
built in the cloud but they still had on

197
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,440
from they had to deal with

198
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,380
they weren't gonna move Oracle servers

199
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,300
from on Prem into the cloud so that

200
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,250
stuff still existed there and so they

201
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,770
still had to work with the restrictions

202
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:15,330
and issues with on cloud or sorry on

203
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:18,460
Prem infrastructure talking to the cloud

204
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:21,340
and that leads to an issue of data

205
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,659
ingress how do you track all the places

206
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,700
that data comes from because that's

207
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,979
where especially if you work in finances

208
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,270
you're gonna have PII you might have

209
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,120
credit card numbers you might have

210
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,679
social security numbers GDP are all

211
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,429
those kinds of things how do you track

212
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,709
where those things come from and so I

213
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,299
think something that people who haven't

214
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,370
worked a lot in the cloud especially a

215
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,469
big companies don't really realize is

216
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,380
there are service limits on everything

217
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,500
on AWS and so on the bottom left you'll

218
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,510
see those are the service limits on im4

219
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,400
the cloud and you would think you know

220
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,580
who would ever need more than 1500

221
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,880
policies for you know I am in the cloud

222
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,460
but

223
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,020
I know customers who have asked a degree

224
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,000
O's to raise all these and are still

225
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,430
hitting them and that's what happens

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,960
over time is people don't go into the

227
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,089
cloud with a lot of structure or

228
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:18,520
planning and things just sprawl like

229
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:21,580
crazy so meanwhile it's meanwhile

230
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,990
security we you know I'm a security

231
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,120
person so I don't mean to be insulting

232
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,370
but you know I don't feel like we

233
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,950
knocked on Prem security out of the park

234
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,110
before we started moving on to the cloud

235
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:37,060
so we're now struggling to still keep

236
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,740
I'll just keep letting this play we

237
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,170
struggled to do on from security well

238
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,580
and now we're doing cloud security as

239
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,949
well and then we have to interconnect

240
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,370
those two pieces it's you know it's very

241
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,990
difficult so a good security team is

242
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,240
trying to enable without being insecure

243
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,520
which is very difficult in the cloud

244
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,410
because at every reinvent a TBS

245
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,090
announces some new service with new

246
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,310
service which sounds awesome to a

247
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,630
developer and now it's up to the

248
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,119
security team to figure out how to make

249
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,250
that available and secure that so that

250
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,290
it's not just another you know insecure

251
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,540
service out there and you also have to

252
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,819
build security services that are cloud

253
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,579
centric you can't just have everyone

254
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,770
funneling back to on Prem for some some

255
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,870
kind of service for like kms or

256
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,120
something like that you have to have

257
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:24,520
cloud centric solutions at the same time

258
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,170
our job is a huge a huge amount of

259
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,030
putting out fires and plugging holes and

260
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,430
that's you know now the holes are cloud

261
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,050
scale instead of just on Prem and now

262
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,089
people have access to create security

263
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,219
groups with port 22 open to the world

264
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,570
versus you know changing the firewall

265
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,040
rules which was done by a small team

266
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:44,860
generally so what are some of the things

267
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,939
that you know I dealt with while we were

268
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,470
there well my company was there so a few

269
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,490
different things so controlling data

270
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,500
ingress that was a big one you know kind

271
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,240
of going back to the beginning it's not

272
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,460
about some crazy super technical way of

273
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,350
solving these issues its fundamentals a

274
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,760
lot of times so understanding where your

275
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,190
data is coming from understanding the

276
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,080
sources of it and really locking that

277
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,340
down and creating pipelines and patterns

278
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,410
how you get that data into your accounts

279
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,270
and that goes to file transfer to is the

280
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,120
same thing building standardized way

281
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,560
standardized ways of doing this really

282
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,050
helps and publishing it and making it

283
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,869
available for everyone to use and then

284
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,670
tackling PCI that people's it's like

285
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,240
people's least favorite thing to deal

286
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,490
with

287
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,990
but a lot of people especially

288
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:38,230
especially in financials have to be PCI

289
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,940
compliant and you know there actually

290
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,980
are some good opportunities in the cloud

291
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,600
to tackle that because you can do things

292
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,130
like micro segmentation very easily

293
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,650
because everything is ephemeral

294
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,180
everything is you know virtual so a new

295
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,160
account costs you nothing setting up

296
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:57,310
dedicated networking and routes for PCI

297
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:59,290
is very straightforward so and I sort of

298
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,939
touched on this but a word on data

299
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,599
scientists are there any data scientist

300
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,120
in the room what two people were brave

301
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,830
enough to say yes so let me say I have a

302
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,930
lot of respect for data scientists they

303
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,310
do amazing things I can't I'm not gonna

304
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,780
say that I you know understand

305
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,599
everything about machine learning or can

306
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:22,420
do all those things but from a security

307
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:26,800
perspective I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't

308
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:29,229
mean to hate on anyone but my experience

309
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,599
was you know you have this huge formal

310
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,130
security team who's trying to secure the

311
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,110
data in the cloud secure your

312
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,580
infrastructure do all these things and

313
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,380
then you have a data science team who's

314
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,870
like alright I'm gonna spin up an AWS

315
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,490
account I'm gonna pipe all of our guy

316
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,620
data over there so I can run some Python

317
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,990
scripts because doing everything through

318
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:52,200
the official process is way too hard so

319
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:55,060
apologies but there's my experience so

320
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,040
Michael Jordan you know visionary he was

321
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,630
way ahead of the curve in basketball but

322
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,498
he also knew quite a bit about cloud

323
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,939
security so

324
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:06,519
yeah part of that quote is cut off it

325
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:08,649
was about cloud so so what are the what

326
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,599
are the keys to basketball or the keys

327
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,399
to cloud security it is about the

328
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,869
fundamentals that's true about every

329
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,239
piece of security doesn't matter if it's

330
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:18,429
network or application or cloud security

331
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:20,319
but I think the basics are what people

332
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:23,709
miss because they're focused on you know

333
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:27,069
more interesting and cutting-edge type

334
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:28,478
of solutions but it's really you know if

335
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:30,218
you can inventory what you have in the

336
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:33,069
cloud if you can detect the drift that's

337
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:34,269
going on based on your baseline alert on

338
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:36,279
that and then remediate it quickly

339
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:39,879
you're way ahead of the curve compared

340
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:42,399
to most places and I think you know the

341
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:44,769
cloud allows people to do things very

342
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,059
quickly and at huge scale and that's a

343
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,609
problem in the sense of trying to keep

344
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,468
up keep the pace up with what people are

345
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:52,629
doing so quickly but it also gives us as

346
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:54,279
security people the ability to scale our

347
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:57,009
solutions very quickly too and react

348
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:06,129
very quickly so I think it's a huge

349
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:08,259
opportunity for us yeah so thanks so I

350
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,569
think to summarize you know what what

351
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:12,339
Mike is been saying is you know

352
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:14,169
regulated financial services can really

353
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,519
be a cloud help for a variety of reasons

354
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:19,029
and if you're pouring gasoline on a fire

355
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,649
then it can look just like that it's

356
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:24,129
challenging you're handcuffed by things

357
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:26,799
like compliance and regulation and an

358
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:30,159
aversion to change and you know in

359
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,569
finance money matters it's people's

360
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,509
livelihoods there's a lot of liability

361
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:36,459
and lawyers involved there's a big

362
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,169
misunderstanding of of cloud in general

363
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,689
and how to move correctly and it's it's

364
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:43,539
changing all the time so my perspective

365
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:45,129
is really from being inside of one of

366
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:47,468
those organizations for an extended

367
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:49,169
period of time and sort of shedding some

368
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:51,639
light on that and how we handled it so

369
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:54,519
this name to protect the innocent as

370
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,809
Lisa's lending and I want to talk about

371
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,779
this one for a little bit because it's

372
00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:01,598
more of a medium-sized organization they

373
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,099
are doing a lot of innovative things in

374
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:05,139
finance they're hungry for new stuff

375
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:08,409
they have a lot of really great talent

376
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:09,909
managers are technical but they're just

377
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:12,099
starting to get bound by things like

378
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,809
regulations and partnerships and larger

379
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,560
organizations that are sort of bringing

380
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:17,410
this stuff down

381
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,180
into into their world and it handcuffs

382
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,240
people in some regards so you have to

383
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,529
adapt to that and be flexible with that

384
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,440
so I don't want it to come across that

385
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:27,910
you know folks are not considering

386
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,529
security and that they're you know

387
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,000
compliance to secure anything like that

388
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,500
we want to show that some light on like

389
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,870
how we sort of do some skunk work

390
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,900
security to try to try to make real

391
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,160
stuff happen so as Mike mentioned that

392
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,020
you know I want to get into some of the

393
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:46,329
major things that we faced being

394
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:53,500
internal to that the major one is not

395
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:55,180
moving so we'll wait for that I'll start

396
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,010
talking to it if it gets to but some of

397
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,849
the major things are they're large and

398
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,220
they're complex

399
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,100
now size and complexity isn't just a

400
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,020
necessarily an organizational thing they

401
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,910
can be large banks or large financial

402
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,650
institutions but it's also the

403
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,900
complexity of the organization itself

404
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,189
when it's establishing a relationship

405
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,310
with those types of organizations

406
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,500
whether those are partnerships or your

407
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,469
applications are complicated or

408
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,870
something along those lines the people

409
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,390
you work with are important as much as

410
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:28,780
PCI or some other socks or sock or

411
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:35,860
something like that so they are heavily

412
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:36,760
regulated they are heavily regulated all

413
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,020
right so we're having some technical

414
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,260
difficulties and the slides aren't

415
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,870
moving

416
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,700
but when regulations hit we always

417
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,350
preach in security that compliance

418
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,580
doesn't equal security but then the

419
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,510
question becomes how do you do it right

420
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,330
you're gonna have to meet that

421
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,069
compliance ask and the importance is

422
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,560
making that regulation work for you in

423
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,060
as as much of a way as possible the

424
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,650
other thing is that your partnerships

425
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,359
and your the people that you work with

426
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,069
may have regulations that you don't feel

427
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
like you need to adhere to but in order

428
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,670
to engage in that partnership you're

429
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,280
gonna have to work with that and leases

430
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,949
lending that was FIPS 140-2 level three

431
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,639
is anybody familiar with that yeah it's

432
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,110
a pain in the ass it's a lot of physical

433
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,850
security requirements and encryption

434
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,729
requirements that you really don't

435
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,530
necessarily want to deal with and in

436
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,689
some cases the management of that type

437
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,399
of thing in a smaller organization is so

438
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,079
complex that you end up being less

439
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,530
secure because you're trying to meet all

440
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,360
these requirements that you

441
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,120
the expertise for so how do you approach

442
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,889
that in regulation there's also this

443
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,689
misconception of what the cloud offers

444
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,190
you how many folks have like gone into a

445
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,670
vendor meeting or something like that

446
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,500
and somebody says well you know AWS is

447
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,660
socked to compliant PCI compliance and

448
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,970
we're good to go right I mean that's

449
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:50,000
it's all about the implementation of

450
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,710
that and so if you have that if you go

451
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,180
in with that mindset you're basically

452
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,250
having to change people's minds as you

453
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,550
go so now you're talking about how these

454
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,080
vendors for trying to gain gain you're

455
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,100
trying to get these try these vendors

456
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,120
are trying to sell to your business so

457
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,709
they're saying all these things to

458
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,209
higher level management and they may not

459
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,750
be technical so you're trying to get all

460
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:11,780
this stuff going in together can you go

461
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,370
to the next slide on there at least yeah

462
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,920
so when you're going from the data

463
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,409
center to the cloud you have this idea

464
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,610
that okay we're gonna go from we're

465
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,750
gonna take our data center we're going

466
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,129
to move it to the cloud everyone's like

467
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,410
no don't lift and shift you want to use

468
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,700
what's available to you and and all of

469
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,740
that but there's there's so many things

470
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,380
that you have to consider with that the

471
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,680
cloud to us isn't just AWS right it's

472
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:36,140
SAS providers it's your the your CRM

473
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,530
your integrations the and financial

474
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,810
institutions you have these weird niche

475
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:44,270
sort of financial institution providers

476
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,760
that are these cots off-the-shelf they

477
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,580
only do like ACH or transactional things

478
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,310
so when you are trying to think about

479
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,720
what is the cloud gonna offer me many

480
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,220
folks will come to you with AWS services

481
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,250
but that's not really all that you're

482
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,540
having to think about so this is where I

483
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,180
was at this is exactly where I was at

484
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,260
okay so we have these third parties and

485
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,740
then we're thinking about how do we

486
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,000
convert to the cloud some people will go

487
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,130
with lifting shift and that might be the

488
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,800
best option for them how many of you

489
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:16,070
have seen this okay

490
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,200
that is like my hell for like two years

491
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,000
because when you look at this and this

492
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,010
is sold to you and this is sold to

493
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,660
management they're like well let's just

494
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,960
use SAS we don't have to do anything in

495
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,610
security or let's just do infrastructure

496
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,230
as a service but there are so many

497
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,100
things that you have to consider with it

498
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,110
you know when you're doing

499
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,699
virtualization and servers and storage

500
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,020
and networking yeah your vendor manages

501
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,179
it but you still have configuration

502
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,330
options with something like EBS you've

503
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:42,070
got VP C's to worry about

504
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,168
you may not control the hypervisor the

505
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,120
low-level hardware but you still have

506
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:48,789
responsibility there and in some cases

507
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,768
especially in application security those

508
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:53,620
are now going from your operations folks

509
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:55,269
to your development teams so now your

510
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,279
development teams have to be experts in

511
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:59,559
this new configuration item so they have

512
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,120
to be familiar with whatever cloud

513
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,678
provider you're going through and then

514
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,178
to Mike's point about multi cloud you

515
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,730
add more clouds of that and then you you

516
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:09,850
know you end up putting all of that back

517
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,080
onto one team so when you're looking at

518
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,939
this you really have to consider the

519
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,360
layers of security that go along with

520
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,529
each of these areas also legacy stuff oh

521
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,240
my god so you have when you start as a

522
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:23,799
sort of this medium more innovative

523
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,899
we're using things you know back in the

524
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,360
day it was like we're using Ruby you

525
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:30,399
know we're in finance and so you get

526
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,110
into starting these partnerships and

527
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,439
you're like okay now we gotta integrate

528
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,668
with like COBOL and mainframes so you

529
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,110
know you're trying to tie these two

530
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,880
things together and move to the cloud

531
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,500
all at the same time and maintain the

532
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,769
security of it and as Mike said with

533
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,809
that wonderful animation of security and

534
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:48,610
how we feel you know we're we're trying

535
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:52,510
to basically do all these things at one

536
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:54,549
time with like a seven person team so

537
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,320
basically the point is we're all taking

538
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:58,240
a leap of faith together if you convince

539
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,649
your organization to go to the cloud and

540
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,970
you're hiring people like Mike and

541
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,500
you're bringing them along with you like

542
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,789
you're basically they're putting their

543
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,269
trust in you to take this leap of faith

544
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:08,529
not only your organization but the the

545
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:10,450
partners that you're working with and

546
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:11,799
everyone else but everyone's still like

547
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,510
really freaking confused about

548
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,580
everything and they don't know what

549
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,519
services to use what processes they need

550
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,320
to change what they can and can't do and

551
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,409
that's just on how do we get there not

552
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,450
even focusing on the security so

553
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:28,029
releases lending we tried to focus on

554
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,320
some key areas other than regulation

555
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:31,929
which is going to sort of permeate all

556
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,408
of this the first was stability like how

557
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:38,139
do we get our clients to how do we keep

558
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:40,059
our clients on the platform how do we

559
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:42,490
make sure that we're not you know

560
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:46,330
introducing some sort of latency or

561
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,970
whatever the stability of the team that

562
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,408
the what expertise we need whether the

563
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,590
product is going to be more or less

564
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,870
efficient like those are concerns of

565
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,220
and the business because you know we

566
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,678
can't we don't have as much of that

567
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,270
absorption cost and then resource

568
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,789
management like I'm like I mentioned

569
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:05,940
we're a really small security team you

570
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:07,650
know we're like 1 to 75 developers or

571
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,450
something like that we had like 1/2 sec

572
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,330
person and when you're when you're

573
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,520
scaling like that you know you have that

574
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,480
person doing assessments or whatever it

575
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,129
may be and then you're like okay now

576
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,289
Google earn the cloud and then come back

577
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,970
and you're gonna do all that too and so

578
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,440
you're trying to figure out how are you

579
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,559
going to make that work are you hiring

580
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,029
consultants are you just putting in a

581
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,190
small workload you know what do you do

582
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,690
and then on the more functional side

583
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,980
there were a couple of services key

584
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,380
management and secret management that

585
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,149
sort of permeated everything that we did

586
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,610
that we had to figure out back to the

587
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:41,668
FIPS 140-2 level 3 real pain in the butt

588
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:44,699
when you're going to cloud now when

589
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:46,440
you're looking at that that means that

590
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,090
you have these client requirements these

591
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,409
regulatory requirements and then you're

592
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,689
trying to figure it all out and make

593
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,520
sure that it is actually secure and then

594
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,080
with secret management it was one of

595
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,240
those things where you know when you're

596
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,500
young and you're an organization and all

597
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,029
of your developers are creating like

598
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,830
password one passwords for staging

599
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,809
they're like it's just staging or it's

600
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,370
just development you're like ok well now

601
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,830
we have an opportunity to like change

602
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,750
that paradigm and move to the cloud and

603
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,520
use something that we can dynamically

604
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,630
generate but wait we still stuff in the

605
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,168
data center so how the hell are we gonna

606
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,059
do that so this is where we sort of

607
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:19,950
gotten into the solution a-and the first

608
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:22,379
like step we took into it

609
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,299
the consultants we talked to we weren't

610
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,179
talking to Mike he wouldn't recommend

611
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:29,340
this but they were like well AWS s cloud

612
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,020
hsm just use that they've got kms just

613
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,668
used that they have I am just use that

614
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,770
and we're like we some things in the

615
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:36,690
data center that aren't gonna move at

616
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,918
least in the next year or two years that

617
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,250
we have to think about so how are we

618
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,380
going to leverage these AWS services so

619
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,480
it really came down to a business

620
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,299
decision across the board where security

621
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,000
basically had to sell security as we do

622
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:54,059
as a as an equation of time money and

623
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,580
effort and security is traditionally a

624
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:58,889
cost center so how do we make a

625
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,539
functional event how do we become a

626
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,840
functional benefit to the business and

627
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:06,240
we try to tie everything back to this if

628
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,189
we look at I am orakau

629
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,559
and we better easier account management

630
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,240
we want if we want to talk about secret

631
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,010
management it's because we're making

632
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,170
those secrets not only we're making them

633
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,280
more secure but they auto-rotate you're

634
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,530
developers don't have to worry about

635
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,360
them they just request the access we

636
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,070
handle that through access control we

637
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,110
get to reduce the overall access of

638
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,720
those developers so we're making it more

639
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,678
secure and faster for the business we're

640
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,990
reducing the amount of time that

641
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,880
developers spend on that if you talk

642
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,240
about things like buying authentication

643
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,410
with something like kognito or on 0

644
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,179
which is really hard in financial

645
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,690
services by the way identity is a big

646
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,160
deal you're you're saying you know we're

647
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,170
buying a whole team of people these

648
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,940
people specialize in authentication you

649
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,860
know we have one person to work on it

650
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,570
here would you rather you know John in

651
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,280
the basement pouring gasoline on the

652
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,689
fire work on the authentication or do

653
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,059
you want an entire team that's dedicated

654
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,500
their entire business to this so you're

655
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,300
trying to sell like how are you going to

656
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,530
reduce the time reduce the money spent

657
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,000
or reduce the effort that you put into

658
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,309
it and then you're gonna meet all your

659
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,840
compliance concerns along the way so

660
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,910
this is what that journey for leases

661
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,178
lending look like right we started out

662
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:14,460
as just we have some things in the data

663
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,010
center we have some things in the

664
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,660
offices we have some HSMs over there

665
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,570
that are highly available it's all

666
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,000
integrated with LDAP now as we take that

667
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,439
step into the cloud we have to consider

668
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,980
how we're gonna maintain

669
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,660
this double life and so we start

670
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,550
experimenting with containerization like

671
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,690
docker and then for secrets management

672
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,970
we start experimenting with vault

673
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,260
because the major decision there was how

674
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,200
do we use something that's going to

675
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,420
support both infrastructures we still

676
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,220
have to maintain that FIPS 140-2 level 3

677
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,570
so we have that and we still have these

678
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,670
servers down in the office that the data

679
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,210
scientists are using so how are we going

680
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:52,440
to move this over we have I am up there

681
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,300
we're integrating with LDAP we're

682
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,070
experimenting and then the idea passed

683
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,110
this dotted line which you know we're

684
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,419
that's still in migration is sort of

685
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,370
like okay we're gonna start leveraging

686
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,070
organisations maybe we'll experiment

687
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,600
with kubernetes and we'll try Cloud HSM

688
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,580
with the idea that maybe they're gonna

689
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,290
come along and and fulfill that and then

690
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,909
we can start reducing some of the lower

691
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,450
infrastructure reducing the money spent

692
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:18,179
on these on these on-premise functions

693
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,830
like HSM and then you know the dream is

694
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,390
basically we start using server lists

695
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,600
get there but this is a four year plan

696
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,789
right so we go to no AWS the taking our

697
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,350
first dipping our toe into the sand then

698
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:31,980
we got a hybrid and then maybe we end up

699
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:33,658
cloud native fish so that's sort of a

700
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,309
real-world journey so it really comes

701
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,929
down to where does your organization and

702
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,658
financial services or any regulated

703
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:42,929
industry fall in this area are you cloud

704
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,179
native are you some you know in-between

705
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,980
or are they are you never going to go to

706
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,809
cloud or there's some components of your

707
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,460
organization that will never go or won't

708
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:52,529
go in the next five or ten years and

709
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,299
those are like your mainframes right

710
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,519
there are some things that just won't go

711
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:57,690
they've been around for thirty years and

712
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,210
you don't know how to manage them so

713
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:03,179
they have to stay there or one of your

714
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:08,730
partners has one of those so that brings

715
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:09,929
me to Mike's last financial institution

716
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,370
you probably won't have any issues with

717
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:18,659
his presentation here so yeah the last

718
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:20,729
example was Homer's hedge fund so if we

719
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,429
go back to the first two so Bart's

720
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,799
banking they were a typical huge

721
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:27,360
financial who over many years moved into

722
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,379
the cloud learned a lot of hard lessons

723
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,049
and have kind of come out of it the

724
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,899
other side in pretty good shape but

725
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,490
still issues but in pretty good shape

726
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:38,158
Lisa's lending did more of an iterative

727
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:40,919
move towards the cloud did things pretty

728
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,840
structured in a pretty sane way now we

729
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,029
have Homer's hedge fund as you'd assume

730
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:51,059
from Homer not the best way of doing

731
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:52,700
something so died so three years three

732
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:54,840
years in the cloud but not it's not a

733
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,230
strategic decision to move to the cloud

734
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,059
yet they're ramping up their apps but

735
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,110
it's not like with Bart's making where

736
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:05,940
it was just so let's move everything

737
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:07,860
into the cloud the tools and the skills

738
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,240
are still building you know developers

739
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,889
aren't used to what the cloud means for

740
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,440
them much less security understanding

741
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:15,389
what the cloud means and so this the

742
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,399
services the skills and tools are all

743
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,629
still kind of coming along and at the

744
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:21,899
same time they're moving into multi

745
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,429
cloud so now they have on Prem and then

746
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:27,860
multiple clouds they have to secure and

747
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:27,860
SAS as Ken talked about before so

748
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:48,549
never using the cloud again yeah this is

749
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:51,429
all intentional this was those plans all

750
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,840
right so what's happened they wandered

751
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,429
into the cloud and they can't get out so

752
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,830
I think this is this story is much more

753
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:59,320
typical than a lot of companies because

754
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,389
people start experimenting with AWS they

755
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,950
use some ec2 some RDS and then

756
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,690
developers keep moving more and more

757
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,610
workloads there and before you know it

758
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,919
you know you are a cloud-based company

759
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,240
and you can't back out of that and it's

760
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,890
not that they necessarily even want to

761
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,510
it's not that they don't want to be in

762
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,909
the cloud and they want to stay on Prem

763
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,070
forever it's just that they didn't do it

764
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:21,610
intentionally and that's unlike Lisa's

765
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:28,529
lending so they're kind of where Bart's

766
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:28,529
making was five or four years ago so

767
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,789
everything that Bart's banking does have

768
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,219
homers this is hard to say after a while

769
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:37,899
Homer's hedge fund doesn't have so the

770
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,360
basics aren't there so knowing what's in

771
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:41,590
the cloud is not set up yet even basic

772
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,139
things like vulnerability scanning

773
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,699
that's not there yet you know all these

774
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,860
kind of very basic things that we think

775
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,140
of reporting tooling they don't even

776
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,149
have a multi cloud strategy but they're

777
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,919
already spinning up multiple clouds can

778
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:55,918
anyone tell me what that is right there

779
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:04,529
Prius cloud I red cloud I am a dad so

780
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:07,659
that's my dad joke for this presentation

781
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:09,549
so yeah they're doing there have kind of

782
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:12,789
a hybrid cloud strategy where they're

783
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:14,049
not moving everything over so basically

784
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:16,149
they're trying to do all these things at

785
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:17,770
once they don't have you know five

786
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:20,889
hundred percent security team to can

787
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:24,460
tackle all of these things so you know

788
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:26,260
what do they what do they do then you

789
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,909
have to start putting together a plan of

790
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,470
how you tackle this like they can't back

791
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,330
out of the cloud they can't you know

792
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,340
shut down their AWS accounts and just

793
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,350
say no we're sticking with on-prem so

794
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,809
you have to create a plan for how you

795
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,158
will adopt the cloud and how you'll take

796
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:42,039
everything that's already there and

797
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,120
formalize it so a word that gets thrown

798
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,890
around a lot

799
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,129
patterns and I think it's it's pretty

800
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,990
important because not everyone can be

801
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,880
you know the special snowflake that does

802
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:53,590
things their own way you have to shape

803
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,440
things in a way that people can adopt it

804
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,689
and then have some kind of norms that

805
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,520
everyone's using when you move into the

806
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,790
cloud not everyone can use whatever they

807
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,350
want from AWS or Azure and then just you

808
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,930
know we have a security team use trying

809
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,510
to secure 50 different services so

810
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:12,130
having patterns for how you go to the

811
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,390
cloud is really important so building

812
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,550
that out even using something like

813
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,990
elastic Beanstalk just to start out does

814
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,178
they get things into the cloud in a

815
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,670
standardized deployment model can give

816
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:23,290
you a lot more control

817
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,230
standardizing Identity and Access

818
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,850
Management all those things are

819
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,670
fundamental basic ideas but they have a

820
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,649
huge security impact and then you need

821
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,330
you need a team of people different

822
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,490
stakeholders that are centralized who

823
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:39,428
can bring together all the different

824
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,250
pieces of the cloud and really put a

825
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:43,150
plan together and drive towards that

826
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,960
because if you don't have that and

827
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,510
you're just trying to do it piecemeal

828
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:51,030
you're always gonna stay in a horrible

829
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:54,900
insecure mishmash of on-prem and cloud

830
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:57,970
so and then quick word on multi cloud

831
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:00,790
you know a lot of people have different

832
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:03,429
opinions on what multi cloud means some

833
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,379
people some executives like to think of

834
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:07,120
it as a way to avoid vendor locking

835
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,950
which I don't agree with because you

836
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,169
can't really use something like kms or I

837
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,420
am an AWS and then not be locked in

838
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:16,150
because your whole authorization models

839
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,260
built on a proprietary tool so I don't

840
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,610
think of it is that way and I don't

841
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,340
think of it necessarily as a cloud

842
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,870
agnostic like building cloud agnostic

843
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,350
workloads that you can deploy to a juror

844
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,790
or AWS I think it was more you have

845
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,100
different platforms that have different

846
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,409
strengths and that's a good thing I mean

847
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,879
there's some things that a sure does

848
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,650
even from a security perspective that is

849
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,280
better than AWS even though they're not

850
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:41,590
as far along as AWS so people should

851
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,629
really utilize those strengths but it is

852
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,909
difficult for us as security folks

853
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,980
you're trying to be a AWS security

854
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,460
expert to then also pick up a sure or

855
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,860
GCP so that's a it's a tough thing but

856
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,290
it is happening it is gonna become more

857
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,010
popular I don't think is gonna be

858
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:59,559
necessarily

859
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,270
trying to be agnostic trying to be a dr

860
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,410
plan it's going to be kind of using the

861
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:08,230
different strengths from the different

862
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:09,549
clouds so compliance so as I said Ken

863
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,830
and I both have done a lot of very

864
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:13,418
technical work we spent years you know

865
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,949
doing pen tests and doing source code

866
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:17,049
reviews and working with developers and

867
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,179
general hacking stuff that you know

868
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:21,129
everyone here probably enjoys and so

869
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:24,130
compliance to us was always kind of the

870
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,390
non techie people who you know walk

871
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,850
around with clipboards and send out

872
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,290
spreadsheets with things and Excel that

873
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,850
I don't even understand how they work

874
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,570
I'm sure the data scientists could maybe

875
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:36,250
explain that to me they don't hate me

876
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,750
but I've kind of changed my mindset over

877
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,710
time working more in the cloud because

878
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:44,530
if if as an application security person

879
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:46,360
you could you could say to me like I can

880
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,370
script something out that tells you all

881
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,659
the vulnerabilities in your application

882
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,159
and I can script something out to fix

883
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,280
all those things and I can tell you

884
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,410
right now how vulnerable your app is and

885
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,070
we can fix it immediately like that

886
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,530
would be amazing

887
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,330
but no offense any vendors in the room

888
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:04,210
but the tools are not there yet for app

889
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:06,668
second we're we're ways away but with

890
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,740
cloud we do have that ability you know

891
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:10,480
we can we can say this is how it should

892
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:12,368
look and then take what it looks like

893
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,469
find the diff and then fix that almost

894
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:15,970
immediately and there's a lot of toying

895
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,649
out there that actually and people doing

896
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,569
that already

897
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,879
arts banking was one that you know did

898
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,200
auto remediation but that's kind of

899
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:25,480
further down the line and even security

900
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,560
people aren't necessarily comfortable

901
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,690
with that they're not always comfortable

902
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,560
saying we're gonna write tools to go and

903
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:35,770
fix things as soon as they are insecure

904
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,299
so my point there is compliance always

905
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,489
sounds terrible I never liked it I

906
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,590
wasn't a fan of compliance people maybe

907
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,118
I'm still not but I think it is it's

908
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,490
hugely important especially in the cloud

909
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,290
to think about security and compliance

910
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:49,270
is one thing and that it's kind of a

911
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,770
partnership and it's really important

912
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,869
for security people who know the tech

913
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,909
stack to work with compliance to set the

914
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:56,290
right standards and policies and all

915
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,000
those things because if they create the

916
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,590
wrong ones and then you're in charge of

917
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,970
enforcing them you're gonna hate life

918
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:04,530
and developers are going to hate you and

919
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:06,759
that's where we've been for thirty years

920
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,930
so what to do

921
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,300
talked about a lot of different problems

922
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,250
but you know how can

923
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,380
you approach these things and try to fix

924
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,360
it so everything is about scale and

925
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,920
complexity when it comes to the cloud so

926
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,580
standardizing on how you do things

927
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,220
patterns is a big piece defining secure

928
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,730
ways of doing what developers need to do

929
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,750
if that's how they use ec2 or lambda

930
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,180
that's what you have to do you have to

931
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,460
create ways for them to do things to

932
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,440
deploy code out to use services in a

933
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,630
secure manner make that into

934
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,720
documentation and then make that widely

935
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,070
available don't go in after the fact and

936
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,509
tell them that it's wrong tell them

937
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,060
upfront how to do those things and then

938
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,010
turn all that into you know pipelines

939
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,070
and scripts and CloudFormation templates

940
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:53,740
for people to do that and just adopt and

941
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,060
that goes into automation everything in

942
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,770
the cloud can be automated there's no

943
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,210
reason for anyone to go into the console

944
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,650
and start clicking on things

945
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,460
everything can be automated and can

946
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:05,260
we'll talk about that a little bit and

947
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,450
cloud is a is a people an organization

948
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,150
problem not a tech problem in my mind

949
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:13,720
the tech is secondary to everything else

950
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:16,930
because cloud cuts across all aspects of

951
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,160
the company and kind of like what I said

952
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,169
before I think it's a huge security

953
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,420
opportunity because I'm like AB SEC

954
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:24,190
where we have to read code and we have

955
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,440
some tooling that can that can dig into

956
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,540
the code in the cloud we have an API

957
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,370
that's very rich and tells us what's

958
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,420
there and what's insecure and how we can

959
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:35,830
fix it very quickly so so I think the

960
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,600
the kind of lessons we learned across

961
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,880
all the different companies we have

962
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,400
worked with is cloud security is hard at

963
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,870
any scale even if you have ten ec2 s and

964
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,650
you're just a start-up and you have one

965
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:51,460
app out there it's it's hard to do so

966
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:53,550
you need to plan early and adapt that

967
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,420
plan is often as things change every

968
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,920
reinvent you're gonna have to adapt your

969
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,960
security plan because you now have a new

970
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,210
security or a new service you have to

971
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,290
start using and make secure and then

972
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,850
just be comfortable with the fact that

973
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,620
it's going to be complex no matter what

974
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:08,350
you can't use the cloud in a simple way

975
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:11,549
and really adopt it and just be

976
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,549
comfortable with those risk trade-offs

977
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:17,710
[Music]

978
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:19,390
so we've had a lot of in a lot of years

979
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,360
trying we're trying to pack into this

980
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,930
into this talk so and I think we can

981
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,790
just

982
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,828
a little bit about what are some of the

983
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,599
things that you can do today or at least

984
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,970
prepare for today and what are some of

985
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:33,970
the things that we can work with so I do

986
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:35,950
want to go through a semi pseudo

987
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,180
technical example just to show sort of

988
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,149
one of the things that we didn't work

989
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,440
with and that is identity access

990
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,510
management I think it's one of the first

991
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,790
things you hear about doing you want to

992
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:49,930
do an AWS so how do we use I am i think

993
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,308
that if we break it down into that

994
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,069
iterative approach that we talked about

995
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:55,599
for leases lending you have three ways

996
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:57,279
to think about it your traditional

997
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,770
manual review we have your compliance

998
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,540
auditor they're coming in turning that

999
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:05,559
into automation and then making that a

1000
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:08,829
managed tested process for Apple for

1001
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:11,170
access and management review so in the

1002
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:12,609
traditional you sort of review a process

1003
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,410
in place somebody comes with you with

1004
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:16,630
one of these and they say all right you

1005
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,670
know relati nick has server access do

1006
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:22,059
you read to be right and the dev manager

1007
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:23,470
has read and write and so they give you

1008
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:25,480
that spreadsheet and you say all right

1009
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,950
I'm gonna go fill this out I'm gonna

1010
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,630
tell you whether this is correct or not

1011
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:33,279
as your manager and then you know get

1012
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:35,770
going now for AWS to migrate to that

1013
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,890
they give you a lot of tools like the

1014
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:42,190
summary manager where I am you can see

1015
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:44,109
where a particular policy is used

1016
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,880
whether it's in a particular role or

1017
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:47,770
group and you can start to work with

1018
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,589
those compliance auditors and your teams

1019
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:54,040
to have that manual process but you have

1020
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:57,339
to adopt the AWS mindset and start using

1021
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,500
the AWS best practice and then once you

1022
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:02,650
understand how it all works you can

1023
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,349
start to look at automating that so when

1024
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,970
we move to the automation phase we start

1025
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:08,680
to think about infrastructure as code

1026
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,290
and it's more than a buzzword in this

1027
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,790
case we it there's a sort of an upfront

1028
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,109
cost if you're not familiar with

1029
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,910
something like terraform or cloud

1030
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:18,220
formation that you have to invest in in

1031
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,558
order for that to even begin to work so

1032
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,839
you have to get development teams to buy

1033
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,250
into this or your devops team if they

1034
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:26,710
haven't already to buy into whatever

1035
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,960
you're using and for leases lending as

1036
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,430
an example you're using terraform

1037
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,650
because you have to manage something

1038
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,379
hybrid so you can't use cloud formation

1039
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,590
and in that particular case because it's

1040
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,410
not going to support your virtual

1041
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:41,870
platform so once you get through

1042
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:44,660
scripting that out the management of

1043
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:48,440
that becomes essentially a code review I

1044
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:51,529
want to add these two users to this

1045
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,420
particular resource that becomes a pull

1046
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,110
request and now that pull request is

1047
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,760
your access review and that brings us to

1048
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:00,950
how that sort of looks inside of that

1049
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,670
summary manager so you can still give

1050
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,319
your auditors that view that grid view

1051
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,120
but on the back end you are going

1052
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,410
through that approval process through

1053
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,960
whatever your change management or

1054
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:15,470
something like that so that's where it

1055
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,530
becomes managed and testable so once you

1056
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,939
are at the point where your your

1057
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,830
development teams are essentially

1058
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,750
creating pull requests and those pull

1059
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,980
requests or changes are going through a

1060
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,900
change management process you are

1061
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,790
satisfying an auditor requirement you're

1062
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,070
not faking it right you're able to

1063
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,040
leverage some of the the effort that

1064
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:35,270
you're used to put into that and making

1065
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,220
compliance work for you as opposed to

1066
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,270
the other way around and once you're at

1067
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,680
that point where you're doing that

1068
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,170
author change management you can start

1069
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,569
to remove access from people that have

1070
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,880
that console access and start to treat

1071
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:48,320
everything through terraform so the what

1072
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,060
we are trying to get to and lisas

1073
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,430
lending is we don't want anyone with

1074
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,840
console access we have a few users that

1075
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,100
we're going to have with console access

1076
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,330
and everyone else is going to handle

1077
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,730
things through change management and we

1078
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:00,620
got to a level of that so you start

1079
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,090
leveraging things like organizations and

1080
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,950
then when people want to experiment you

1081
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:06,920
want to developer account you can use

1082
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:09,560
something like STS roles to treat that

1083
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,540
user as going into their own sandbox

1084
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,730
account and having particular access in

1085
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,200
that way you start to funnel that access

1086
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,620
through a ticketing process and then

1087
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,680
things become part of your process and

1088
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:23,390
there's a check at every point there

1089
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,549
Mike had brought up this tool that I

1090
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,569
think he had used wherein to take it to

1091
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,700
the next level you can start writing

1092
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,110
tests for that and then even doing some

1093
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,580
linting on the back end so that as

1094
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:35,780
you're writing it your developers know

1095
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:37,670
you know what's changing all of this

1096
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,140
allows you to make some powerful

1097
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,120
statements especially in financial

1098
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,540
services to auditors and to your teams

1099
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,910
and to your partners and to enter your

1100
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,650
management you can say things like all

1101
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,299
access is controlled by our change

1102
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,709
management process and goes

1103
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,359
through a code peer-review and that's

1104
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,649
how we handle access and you can't

1105
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,479
really argue with that and your evidence

1106
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,189
comes along with it you can say things

1107
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:00,229
like no one or only a few people have

1108
00:41:58,189 --> 00:42:01,670
console access to AWS and all those

1109
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:03,288
changes are made with terraformer cloud

1110
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,119
formation it's like hugely powerful to

1111
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:06,769
say to an auditor sometimes they don't

1112
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,929
understand what you're saying but it

1113
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:10,488
works out and then the last thing is

1114
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:12,559
changes are validated through standard

1115
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:14,779
test automation if you can test access

1116
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,609
controls I mean that is if you can just

1117
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:18,140
generate a report on the fly because you

1118
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:19,609
know that your process is good again

1119
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,279
going back to Mike's point of patterns

1120
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:24,709
and that's that's an amazing place to be

1121
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:27,499
in and what you're trying to strive for

1122
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:29,390
and if you are trying to think about it

1123
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:30,919
in this way you don't have to be fully

1124
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:34,368
Cloud Data to take advantage of some of

1125
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,900
that stuff and so now we're gonna get

1126
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:39,109
into some key tooling and guidelines

1127
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,549
that we sort of work through in this

1128
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:44,538
just to sort of wrap everything up

1129
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:46,640
the first is infrastructure as code it

1130
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,929
helps as much as it hurts I think that

1131
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,489
getting to the point where you're

1132
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:51,739
writing everything as infrastructure as

1133
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:52,939
code is like a really big lift because

1134
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:55,969
you think you're doing it there's a lot

1135
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:57,589
to learn and it's constantly changing

1136
00:42:55,969 --> 00:43:00,789
but when you start using that you get

1137
00:42:57,589 --> 00:43:03,619
into that rhythm your change management

1138
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:05,929
stuff your auditing all that becomes so

1139
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:07,249
much easier and it does going back into

1140
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:10,400
that equation of reducing the overall

1141
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:13,160
effort the second thing is find a

1142
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,799
champion project to use back to that

1143
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,109
equation when you're talking about when

1144
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:20,299
we go with the hsm example or the secret

1145
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:21,859
management example it's like you you

1146
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:23,630
find something to latch on to that's

1147
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:26,269
going to benefit your security team and

1148
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,759
use that as a win for a functional or

1149
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:30,529
compliance benefit as well you know

1150
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:32,539
security comes first to you and it

1151
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:36,049
should really kind of get to the net to

1152
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:37,459
the next level with everyone else and

1153
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:40,038
the last thing is try to predict the

1154
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:43,118
future a little bit now back to the or

1155
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:47,209
you know whatever pick your time movie

1156
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:50,059
the however you want to look at this you

1157
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:52,459
want to think about how will my on-prem

1158
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:53,989
solution get me to the cloud if that's

1159
00:43:52,459 --> 00:43:55,129
where you want to be you have to

1160
00:43:53,989 --> 00:44:00,709
consider things like we were talking

1161
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:02,420
about with vault or the HSM 2 to be a

1162
00:44:00,709 --> 00:44:05,149
hand in both worlds

1163
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,349
and to support both worlds and then once

1164
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,910
you finally get there if you want to

1165
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:11,960
change over then you're in a good in

1166
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:15,649
your good shape in conclusion I think

1167
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:17,180
some final thoughts yeah so I mean I

1168
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,280
think what Ken and I realized and we

1169
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,720
kind of started this talk off with that

1170
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,890
is that you know we've worked in

1171
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,500
different places and with different

1172
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:26,240
companies of varying size and levels of

1173
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,609
maturity but they all face from the same

1174
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,078
issues and you know we can pretty

1175
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:32,569
confidently say that you all are all

1176
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,309
facing the same issues and a lot of the

1177
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:36,740
solutions are the same as we kind of

1178
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:39,290
covered already so you know hopefully

1179
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,240
from this you can understand where some

1180
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:45,680
solutions can be derived to help with

1181
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,359
those issues and that wraps it up I

1182
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,940
think we got through a limit talk fast

1183
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,819
so we can if there are any questions we

1184
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,470
can open it up otherwise thank you so

1185
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:55,920
