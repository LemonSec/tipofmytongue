[Music]

2
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,550
good afternoon and thank you for coming

3
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:44,489
to this this talk I'm Asad Ali and I

4
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,879
work in the CTO office of Tallis and I'm

5
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,030
based here in Austin when I was looking

6
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,400
for a title for this talk or rather a

7
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,730
topic for this talk I remember this meme

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,860
which I read many many years ago and

9
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,110
then realized that what this meme talks

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,180
about is still very relevant we are

11
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,099
still dealing with issues about identity

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,840
and authentication and access management

13
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,280
online so those items are and those

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,410
topics are still very relevant and then

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
engage our hearts so what this meme is

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,619
so let's go through this mean and then

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,680
we go through the details of what we

18
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,180
talked about so this thing was a cartoon

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
by Peter Steiner that was published in

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,790
The New Yorker back in the nine and 1993

21
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,440
and what it is about is that there's a

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,540
dog that is sitting at the console on

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,130
the other computer and he's looking down

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,069
or to another dog that is looking up

25
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,509
quite surprised and he says don't worry

26
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:40,229
on the internet nobody knows you're a

27
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,390
dog and the New Yorker this is one of

28
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,390
the most publicized and published

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,950
cartoons from doing yoga and the reason

30
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,600
of course is because it's still relevant

31
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,979
and people can still relate to that so

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,780
with that backdrop let's look at what we

33
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,009
will talk about so I want to focus on

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,700
identity authentication access

35
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,500
management single sign-on all the things

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,300
that you are very familiar with so from

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,860
that point if you I mean I'm an you know

38
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,609
a speaking to the choir because you guys

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,550
are very well versed in this I will not

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,040
have any detailed protocol diagrams or

41
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:19,050
protocols or details technology flows

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,549
north source code god forbid however we

43
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,020
will look at things that we know about

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,630
but we will try to see them from a

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,099
different perspective and the goal is

46
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,380
that by looking at it from this

47
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,480
perspective we can see where the future

48
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,950
is moving especially with this backdrop

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,420
of all the hoopla about artificial

50
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,239
intelligence and machine learning with

51
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,869
the strong focus on that we'll see where

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,140
we are and why these things matter

53
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,370
so that

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,410
said let's start with identity and when

55
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,240
you look at it so I often show this

56
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,380
picture in co2 well what does identity

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,100
have to do with this picture

58
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,049
so just so the sake of clarification and

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,260
this is still taking from the from the

60
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,720
movie glory from 1998 a good feel good

61
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,040
film Morgan Freeman and Denzel

62
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,140
Washington so you've not seen it and

63
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,310
this would be a good one to watch but

64
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,170
the way I see it I mean there are two

65
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,520
things which are pertinent in this how

66
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,019
it relates to identity there's one which

67
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,239
is recognized and the other one which is

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,220
relate so recognizes so that others can

69
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,870
recognize you and relate is more for you

70
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,520
and you want to relate to a particular

71
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,050
cause in this case they are relating to

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,880
the Union Army then of course there will

73
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,200
be counterparts who will be relating to

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,959
the Confederate Army so in both the

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,640
cases I'm just this concept of relating

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,400
to something and then being able to

77
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,950
recognize the same thing we see in the

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,459
more contemporary era so here we have

79
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,018
the Patriots and the New York Giants and

80
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,660
for them again it's a concept of okay

81
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,030
being able to recognize each other on

82
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,769
the football field and also to relate to

83
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,630
a particular cause a particular

84
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,280
franchise now of course some may say

85
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,769
that well the plays don't relate to the

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,329
franchise as much as the fans do which

87
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,310
which I guess is is it's true to some

88
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,540
extent and and for the Patriots fan in

89
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,190
the room I mean if you are a patriot fan

90
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,190
I mean of course you'd be very happy

91
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,549
because 7-0 up in this in this season so

92
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,160
that's that's pretty nice on the the

93
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,870
same front I mean I have another still

94
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,310
this this one is from Valkyrie and the

95
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,870
difference of course over here is it's

96
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,400
not a uniform it's something that they

97
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,000
are holding so this is again a nice

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,489
movie with Tom Cruise and Tom Wilkinson

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,779
nice cast on it so it's a nice fast

100
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,650
paced movie so if you have not watched

101
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,750
it this would be another recommendation

102
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,070
and what you see over here is that

103
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,740
they're holding up something which is

104
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,090
serving as an identity card for them and

105
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,800
of course I mean the I won't give it

106
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,719
away the plot but essentially what you

107
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,760
want to be seen as part of a circle and

108
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,440
this is the ID card that you have so

109
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,539
this is more like the bearer tokens that

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,640
we know of in the authorization space if

111
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,050
you have a token you get excess if you

112
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,120
don't have it open you don't so there's

113
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,320
little to do with identity at this point

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,900
other than the fact that you are part of

115
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,210
a plan now at the same time I mean we do

116
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,650
have examples and we have been living

117
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,260
with them those examples of how we

118
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,279
actually get identification tied to a

119
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,469
token

120
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,899
so this is an ID card long long time ago

121
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:02,849
when I had hair and and black hair and

122
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,369
you can see that this is a paper card

123
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:08,789
with laminate on it now at the same time

124
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:10,739
a more recent version of that is much

125
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:12,839
more sophisticated so it's not a

126
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:15,539
laminate it has printing which is done

127
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,149
directly on the card body itself then it

128
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:22,259
has a hologram it also have him has a

129
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:24,089
magstripe at the back and it has a smart

130
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,709
card ship which has biometric

131
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,269
information at raid it can do match on

132
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,829
card you can do all those things so

133
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:31,409
essentially there's a sophistication of

134
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:35,009
how you we have evolved these permanent

135
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:36,688
identifiers in the physical world now

136
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,789
these are permanent and the way we use

137
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:41,669
them we have established protocols and

138
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,289
norms on how adaptable and occasion or

139
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,659
adaptive verification of users would

140
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,009
work you go to a bank teller and if you

141
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,779
are depositing a check they will

142
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:50,879
probably ask you for no identification

143
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,799
at all or maybe just one ID without any

144
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,749
picture that would suffice if you have a

145
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:56,669
drawing money now the authentication

146
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:58,139
girl bar goes a little bit higher I mean

147
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,029
you'll be able to you'll be asked to

148
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,699
show two identifiers and one of them has

149
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,499
to be with the photo ID the same thing

150
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,089
happens when you're dealing with IDs

151
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:08,789
which are not permanent which are

152
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:10,169
temporary so here's an example for let's

153
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,789
see if you go to South by Southwest when

154
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,258
you are given this badge and this badge

155
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,360
doesn't have the same sophistication

156
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:19,919
that it showed you in the ID card but it

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,969
does have probably an RFID it has a QR

158
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,519
code over here so I mean there are

159
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:25,949
things that are used to identify you and

160
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,329
the way you use them is still adaptive

161
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,509
just like we saw in the example of the

162
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,769
bank teller so if you are going into the

163
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,569
exhibition hall probably they just look

164
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:35,429
at the badge okay how you have it from a

165
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:36,809
distance you are trying to go if you go

166
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,279
to some sessions which are more

167
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:39,749
protected and guarded for whatever

168
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,979
reason are there because of security or

169
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,569
because there are other people who want

170
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:45,029
to attend them and they want to control

171
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,559
the access they may actually scan the

172
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:49,589
badge in which case your identity

173
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:54,149
actually is seen in a more prominent way

174
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:56,699
so with these identifiers the question

175
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:57,989
is that we have done that in the

176
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,849
physical world I mean we have these

177
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:02,128
models and we have this systems that

178
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,959
make up how do we handle them in the

179
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:06,449
online world and when you talk about the

180
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,679
online world you go back in history and

181
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,800
say okay well it really started in the

182
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,729
90s and

183
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,490
there are two plays which I'll mention

184
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,620
which are dominant in this and just for

185
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,000
the sake of mentioning so the first one

186
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,520
is Sun Microsystems which no longer

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,740
exists it was acquired by Oracle some

188
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,909
time back and I remember that back in

189
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,370
those days when I was visiting my

190
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:26,620
brother incidentally he worked for

191
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,710
Oracle to that time didn't realize that

192
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,720
they would end up recording Sun you

193
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,090
would drive on highway 101 and you would

194
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,800
see these signs and and this sign was an

195
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:41,710
advertisement by Sun and they would say

196
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,229
that we are the something in in.com and

197
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:48,280
what they were saying was what it meant

198
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:50,050
we are the dot in dot-com because again

199
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,128
I mean the high power service that Sun

200
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,810
was creating on the back end I mean that

201
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,430
was driving the that the growth of the

202
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,169
internet so that was one player that was

203
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,789
dominant the second play that was

204
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,960
dominant and is a Netscape and when I

205
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:03,520
say Netscape I mean sometimes I

206
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,940
mispronounced it as netskope which is

207
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,400
more dominant these days but Netscape

208
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,569
essentially their contribution is coming

209
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,568
of course they created this browser

210
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:17,849
which was the access device that people

211
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:20,860
used but more importantly they made that

212
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:24,240
interaction secure and they'd made it

213
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,680
secure by by this patent which is on SSL

214
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,779
so this form the basis of how the

215
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,029
internet basically boomed in the nine in

216
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:34,510
the 90s and then 2000s and interestingly

217
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:38,110
I mean so this was issued in 1997 and

218
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:40,029
and in fact less than two years after it

219
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,289
was filed so on the patent world in

220
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:42,939
software patent was I mean this was a

221
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,800
very fast track I mean they got it

222
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,839
fairly quickly now the interesting the

223
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,689
reason that I mentioned that is because

224
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,910
what the SSL protocol does is pertinent

225
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,680
to how we define identity and how we

226
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,399
authenticate users in the current space

227
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,380
so here's the SSL handshake protocol so

228
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,920
before they go into the actual data

229
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,120
exchange in the application SSL the

230
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,579
protocol itself at the transport layer

231
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,959
they have to exchange information so

232
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,300
this is to essentially establish the

233
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,010
session keys and all that so the main

234
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,359
points to remember over here I mean

235
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,959
there's a lot of detail in terms of how

236
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,790
the client

237
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,529
hello starts from the client side and

238
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,060
then a lot of steps happen back and

239
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,380
forth and then the idea is to go from

240
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,729
the premaster secret to the master

241
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,540
secret and then that is used to create

242
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,420
the section I

243
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,579
keys which are used for each round-trip

244
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,650
but if you look at number three

245
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,030
that's the server certificate so the

246
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,480
service certificate is sent by the

247
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,910
server to the client now in the protocol

248
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,400
it's not mandatory for the client to

249
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,230
send back the certificate so essentially

250
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,540
it's see it's not a mutually

251
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,010
authenticated protocol at that level the

252
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,829
mandatory part is only on the server

253
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,720
side and the reason for that is when you

254
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,190
look at how it was used so essentially I

255
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,350
mean you want to make sure that if you

256
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,800
are connecting to a website that website

257
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,330
is who that website claims to be as far

258
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,339
as you are concerned your identity

259
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,650
verification will come in later it does

260
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,870
not happen at the transport layer so

261
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,800
it's just like going to a confession now

262
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,300
you want to make sure that you are

263
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,530
confessing to the priest as far as the

264
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,010
priest is concerned they don't want to

265
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,050
know who you are

266
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,100
that's what design but in this case I

267
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,810
mean they would like to know who you are

268
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,510
but they cannot because of the

269
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,400
limitations of the of the system now of

270
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,680
course I mean there is a mutually you

271
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,110
syndicated protocol in tiaras which is

272
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,540
the new the new version of SSL after it

273
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,910
was standardized by IETF but that is not

274
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,339
mandatory so if you don't want to do it

275
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,750
you can still go ahead and start the

276
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,730
session now of course at the application

277
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,530
level you may say ok if the mutual

278
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,690
authentication is not not not done I

279
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,160
will not move forward but at least from

280
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,260
the protocol point of view that's not

281
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,959
mandatory so now you would wonder okay

282
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,310
well from the user point of view the

283
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,920
user knows what server they are talking

284
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,760
to what about the server how would the

285
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,010
server know who you are

286
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,480
now the reason that this protocol was

287
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,100
designed the way it was in the early

288
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,270
days was because as far as you are

289
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,810
concerned they have watered your credit

290
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:01,090
card number that until late 90s I mean

291
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,459
the online commerce was was was was

292
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,080
picking up you would say okay well I

293
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,150
want to purchase this thing or get this

294
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,740
thing and okay what's your credit card

295
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,660
number name credit card number done and

296
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,550
you could say well don't save it for me

297
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,199
because most often people did not trust

298
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,880
what was happening on the Internet now

299
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,440
at the same time it was like the cheaper

300
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,850
or it was convenient so they gave the

301
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,560
credit card number saying okay well it

302
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,750
won't store it and things worked fine so

303
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,760
mutually syndicated yes then in the same

304
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,080
protocol no at the transport layer you

305
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,550
will indicate the server in the

306
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:36,160
application layer authenticate the user

307
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:39,758
now in the current environment

308
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,560
we can still do the same thing but now

309
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,480
we are actually putting information on

310
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,189
the server so let's say if you go to

311
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,329
Amazon you don't want to enter your

312
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,100
credit card number every time so they

313
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:49,839
have your credit card number which means

314
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,230
that now the burden of authenticating

315
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,630
who you are is at the authentication

316
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,250
layer so it's not that even if you don't

317
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,209
have Santa Kate you well well you may

318
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,160
not have the credit card number so

319
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,750
you're safe now the tentacle number is

320
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,759
there if you get 0 somebody's account

321
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,459
now they login and now they can

322
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,569
impersonate you so the burden of having

323
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:12,189
a stronger authentication goes up higher

324
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:14,889
and now you would say ok well how's the

325
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,470
authentication done so for better or

326
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:20,170
worse we all realize that passwords are

327
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,790
still gained we've been trying to

328
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,000
dismantle that castle for a long time

329
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,469
and if you look at this code from Bill

330
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,040
Gates this is from RSA Conference in

331
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,860
2004 so in San Francisco he predicted ok

332
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,540
passwords will be dead because there is

333
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,449
no doubt that over time people are going

334
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,699
to rely less and less on passwords so in

335
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:41,979
general this statement is true over time

336
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:45,579
yes people will rely less and less but

337
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,370
that stretch of time has been quite

338
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:50,859
extensive I mean this was about 15 years

339
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,350
ago and we are still using password and

340
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,790
it was not just in this conference

341
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,310
actually the same claim was made a

342
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,839
couple of months later in Copenhagen and

343
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,869
when he was addressing the Microsoft 84

344
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,130
and the same thing there now the

345
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,050
difference over here was that now

346
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,329
instead of claiming the Roca passwords

347
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:11,889
would be dead he gave an alternative and

348
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:13,420
that alternative was smart cards now at

349
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,399
that point I mean this was really good

350
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,660
news for us because we work for exile

351
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,880
toward that time basically the same

352
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,880
company that now is Telus I mean over a

353
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,180
bunch of Gemalto renaming and then being

354
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,560
acquired by by Tallis so so we were

355
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,779
actually working with Microsoft to that

356
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,540
time to develop this Martin this.net

357
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:33,310
card and then Karen I don't know whether

358
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,189
she's in the room but Karen and I I mean

359
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,380
one of my colleagues in in Telus we

360
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:40,599
worked on the operating system layer and

361
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,579
the security layer on this chip to

362
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,860
create the mosque which was then used to

363
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:47,380
do this but the reality is that that

364
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,250
thing didn't work and the reason that it

365
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,560
didn't work is not the browser

366
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,620
it was because of the usability it's not

367
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,329
that easy to carry a smart card now are

368
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,920
there other two-factor authentication

369
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,399
solutions which are easy to carry and

370
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,670
the answer is in most part not really

371
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,129
and the reason for that is that people

372
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,219
are still trying to find a solution and

373
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:12,709
passwords are still there

374
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,389
last year in ignite so here's another

375
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:18,378
claim for my dissolve again claiming

376
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:19,699
that the era of passwords is over so it

377
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:21,470
looks like that every year somebody

378
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:23,149
claims that the era of passwords is over

379
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,220
but the passwords are still around and

380
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:29,240
the reason for that of course is because

381
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,759
of this extra layer of burden that is

382
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,459
put on the on the user's guide that

383
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,860
device and on the merchants or the

384
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:38,839
subscribers or the identity providers to

385
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,699
basically issues those tokens now having

386
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,959
said that I mean there is some silver

387
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:45,290
lining happening because you can see

388
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:47,899
that wealth windows hello's windows

389
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,269
hello is is fine example alternative we

390
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,189
have now have these authenticators

391
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:55,309
Microsoft have one has one and Talas has

392
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:57,730
one octa has one duo has one and then

393
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:59,839
similarly another example would be Fido

394
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,379
so with these things I mean things are

395
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,149
changing but but the pace of that is not

396
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:06,439
there so let's look at a little bit

397
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,759
that's act a little bit more about what

398
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,930
these authentication methods are and

399
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,360
then we will see how we can build the

400
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,089
case for what what really is needed so

401
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,379
when we talk about authentication they

402
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,910
come in various flavors so I won't go

403
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:18,199
into all of these details I mean suffice

404
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,029
to say there are well passwords is at

405
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,490
the top which is the most easiest one to

406
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:24,889
implement then you could send an SMS as

407
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,860
an OTP not a real OTP in the sense of

408
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:29,300
the algorithm but unknowns which the

409
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,279
server can then verify you send it to

410
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,378
the the phone and then you relay it back

411
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,180
on your access device and other server

412
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:38,180
can say aha this is the same version of

413
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,529
the code which are sent or you could

414
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,239
have a more classical OTP where the

415
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:43,129
algorithm is generated and that could be

416
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,959
done on software or in hardware so

417
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:46,339
depending on which one you pick well the

418
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,920
security level could be higher but the

419
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:51,620
cost could be comparable II different

420
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,469
all you could do a PKI where it's now

421
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,389
based upon public private keys and you

422
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,000
have that in your in your token either

423
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:01,399
in a smart card or or in your phone and

424
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,640
all you could rely on some behavior and

425
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,310
other stuff now

426
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,779
when you classify them it's interesting

427
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,819
say okay well these are all multi-factor

428
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,680
authentication zin what we've been

429
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,630
taught is okay well in order to be a

430
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,579
multi-factor authentication Eid to have

431
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,930
a class of each so your phone Sammy you

432
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,880
cannot have two passwords and claim that

433
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,790
your multi-factor of indicator so it

434
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,220
needs to be what you know which

435
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,230
essentially is your pin or password what

436
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,670
you have which could be a smart card and

437
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,880
other forms of token that I described

438
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,979
over here or what you are which is

439
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,829
essentially some biometric trait about

440
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,860
about you which is unique to do you as a

441
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:39,420
person now over the years what we've

442
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,089
seen is that since those have been

443
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,769
really difficult to implement and deploy

444
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,660
they have been what we call these

445
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,310
supplementary forms of authenticators

446
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,949
which have come on board now you won't

447
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,560
use these by themselves but you can

448
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,600
either pair them together or more

449
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,069
importantly you'll basically combine

450
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,350
them with one of the classical ones and

451
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,329
the most easiest to combine against is

452
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,649
the password so which means that yes I

453
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:03,479
mean you are doing additional forms of

454
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,160
authentication using these supplementary

455
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,020
forms but the password is still around

456
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,760
because that's essentially hard to

457
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,040
replace but easy to deploy and the

458
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,270
supplementary ones are I mean for

459
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,260
instance where you are you geolocation

460
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,910
your network IP address your

461
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,609
surroundings so for instance I mean if I

462
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,650
say well I want to login and over

463
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,418
Bluetooth connection if my application

464
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,040
on the web could figure out that well as

465
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,900
long as I have my mobile phone with me

466
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,600
which I have already paired let me login

467
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,250
if I walk away with my phone in my hand

468
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,139
the application would close so these are

469
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,340
the things which are really interesting

470
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,140
to movement and people have been doing

471
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,909
that the problem with all of these is

472
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,919
that it's hard still hard to deploy and

473
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,669
the reason that it's hard to deploy is

474
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,260
because of this basic tight binding

475
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:50,730
between what you have on the client side

476
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,720
and what you have on the server side so

477
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,490
on the client side you would have some

478
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,230
application which does this

479
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,150
authentication and somehow it has to

480
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,860
relay that information to the server and

481
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,740
the server has to validate that now the

482
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,030
way the server validates it is tied to

483
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,410
the algorithm that you use on the client

484
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,110
which means that there's a tight binding

485
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,000
if I come up with a new algorithm a new

486
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,260
way of authenticating users well I have

487
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,470
to go back and change the server as well

488
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,669
and that's always not not so simple and

489
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,359
the country

490
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:20,639
that Fido standard has done is that it

491
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,189
basically removes that barrier it

492
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:24,689
loosens up that tight binding between

493
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,009
the client and the server and

494
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,950
essentially creates a common protocol

495
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,509
pipe so on the backend server you could

496
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,249
have a file server which can now handle

497
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,379
any kind of Authenticator that you can

498
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:35,549
put on the plant you could first do a

499
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,988
deployment with only one kind of

500
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,609
Authenticator the next day you go around

501
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:40,230
well I want to support smart cards so

502
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:41,908
let's add that as the Authenticator on

503
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,159
the blind side and on the server side

504
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:45,749
you don't have to make any change at all

505
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:49,649
so that's an advantage that that Fido

506
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,879
brings in in order to address that so on

507
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,988
the authentication side we've seen

508
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,189
they're okay well passwords are there

509
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:55,440
but at the same time we are making

510
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,609
strides where we are doing things or

511
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,450
moving things in the positive direction

512
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:02,428
the question is is that enough and as

513
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,619
we've learned in the past well not

514
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:06,090
really because the problem now we get

515
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,209
into is that okay well you can't enter

516
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,799
Kate nicely but when you look at the

517
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,389
enterprise landscape there are three

518
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,039
parties which are involved there's the

519
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:15,928
user

520
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,190
there's the enterprise and then there's

521
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,359
the service world and the social

522
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,769
Wireless are the applications that

523
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,499
you're using or other things that your

524
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:23,850
enterprise wants you to be delegated to

525
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:28,379
or forwarded to so you can use those

526
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:31,730
services and if you're using the model

527
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:34,289
that we have all three have problems

528
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,609
from the users point of view they're too

529
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,960
many credentials so there's a credential

530
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,309
that I use to log on to my company

531
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,289
there's another credential that I use to

532
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:41,428
log on to service provider one and I'm

533
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,109
sure that there are three or four more

534
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,239
service wired is that my enterprise

535
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:46,949
wants me to log into and I have to know

536
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:48,090
the password for all of them in case

537
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,369
they move to a higher level of assurance

538
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,809
and have a second factor chances are

539
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,369
they'll all have their own checking

540
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,190
factor which means that now I have to

541
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:58,949
carry three or four dongles with me so

542
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,809
the user is not happy at all what about

543
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,100
the company well the company is not

544
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:04,918
happy because now it doesn't have any

545
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,350
control the user could have elevated

546
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,519
privileges by moving to a different role

547
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,289
within the organization and now they

548
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,549
have to make sure that that the set of

549
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,230
services that they get from the service

550
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:15,749
provider are tailored accordingly and

551
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,609
now they cannot do that or the user

552
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:19,049
could leave the company and since they

553
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:20,639
still have access directly to the

554
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,929
service fighter they could log in so

555
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:24,508
there's lack of control on the service

556
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,669
provider side I mean on the on the

557
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:28,140
enterprise side what about the service

558
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:30,330
void

559
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,640
equally unhappy and probably more so and

560
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,830
the reason is that they do not want to

561
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,940
deal with the authentication period they

562
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,490
want to focus on the service they are

563
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,260
providing and with dealing with the

564
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,330
authentication they have to worry about

565
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,010
users for getting their passwords users

566
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,629
have to change their passwords so which

567
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,250
means that they have to have all the

568
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,260
deployment on the server side to allow

569
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,850
the change and in case that doesn't work

570
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,700
they need to have support structure for

571
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,889
on call so that uses are not worked out

572
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,390
so with this there you everybody is

573
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,250
unhappy I mean it kind of works but

574
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,960
everybody's unhappy so the solution to

575
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,340
that of course is the the Federation

576
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,580
where you have the identity provider in

577
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,399
the middle the user logs on to that IDP

578
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,659
the IDP has an association with the

579
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,280
company enterprise company and the

580
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,500
service providers and by association

581
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,020
once you log on to the IDP you're

582
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,760
basically logged on to your enterprise

583
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,410
as well as as many sub squaddies that

584
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,600
they have and here's where sam'l then

585
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,300
open ID can have come in and using those

586
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,879
bindings you can you can log in so the

587
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,260
SSO is is solved and the companies that

588
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,030
do that I mean ping is one of them

589
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,830
they've made a lot of money by doing the

590
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,570
single sign-on solution using the ping

591
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,909
federate protocol but then things are

592
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,850
moving and now people want to move

593
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,650
beyond single sign-on and I was at the

594
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,810
the cloud identity summit a couple of

595
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,250
years ago where their CEO hundred

596
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,659
Durrant I mean he was explaining ok well

597
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,480
this is where we are and this is where

598
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,890
we're moving and he didn't put anything

599
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,750
on the y-axis so we don't know whether

600
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,060
it's revenue or whether it's the number

601
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,910
of users or the number of customers but

602
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:59,190
the general trend you can see that their

603
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,530
core base has been single sign-on the

604
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,710
Federation protocol where they want to

605
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:07,230
move to is access which is essentially

606
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,420
access management and and they note the

607
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,350
only ones I mean basically all the other

608
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,340
players like octave Alice do Microsoft

609
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:17,129
they are all moving in the access

610
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,540
management space so authentication yes

611
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,370
we need to have it but it's not enough

612
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,810
single sign-on yes we need to have it

613
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,790
but it's not enough either

614
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:28,679
so what's needed is access management

615
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:31,020
and in terms of access management what

616
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,240
we are saying is that ok well it's not

617
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,700
just that I logged in once at the

618
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,350
Perimeter I need to be continuously

619
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,880
monitored like what do I have access to

620
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:45,149
which applications are in which applique

621
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,700
are out when can I have access in the

622
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,410
morning in the afternoon in the evening

623
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,610
from where can I have access so they

624
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,290
could be different rules when I'm in the

625
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,699
office in the office Network they could

626
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,440
be different rules when I happen I'm at

627
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:01,050
home and still different rules when I'm

628
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:03,480
using a public internet service and then

629
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,010
how often do i alter indicate and when

630
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,190
you combine all of these along with the

631
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:10,590
rather more factors it very easily

632
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,330
becomes very complex environment because

633
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,770
now you're monitoring signals you are

634
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,480
making decisions about that signals

635
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,070
which means that it's not just okay well

636
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,630
I'm stronger than 10th occasion in

637
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,129
multi-factor authentication I'm strong

638
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,140
and single sign-on well you have to

639
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,820
combine a bunch of other technology

640
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,270
components as well like an identity

641
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,040
governance and and identity insurance

642
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,720
may be attentive verification so all of

643
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,560
those things come into play and the

644
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,470
question is how do we do that and this

645
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,179
is where several identity industry

646
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,950
alliances would come in so I'll talk

647
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,780
about three of them which have been

648
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,820
affiliated with in in some capacity and

649
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,220
and I picked them from different

650
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,899
categories so there's one which is the

651
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,120
internet identity workshop so there is

652
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,060
an example of a conference where

653
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,800
like-minded people would go and and and

654
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,879
they're all technologists and and

655
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,629
professionals and they'll talk about

656
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
identity

657
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,400
so that's iiw now the second one which

658
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,350
I'll mention is IDs a identity defines

659
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,240
security alliance so this is an alliance

660
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,740
of like-minded companies in the identity

661
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,180
space who come in and say okay well what

662
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,370
are the best practices that we should be

663
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,190
promoting in telling people about and

664
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,639
the last one is continuous access

665
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,290
evaluation protocol so this is a

666
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,050
standards body which is being formed to

667
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,620
look at new standards and their

668
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,850
architects who are coming in from

669
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:28,590
different companies to define the

670
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:33,300
standards for future so let's do a quick

671
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:34,500
check on on on what iw is so iw

672
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,750
interestingly when you look at it I mean

673
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,790
I was surprised to see that they have a

674
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,990
lot of similarity with with the topic

675
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,540
today which is the the meme that I'm

676
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,040
quoting from from Peter Steiner so so

677
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,920
their logo is a dog that is looking at a

678
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:50,430
laptop and and and the dog has a human

679
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,080
face mask on it so lot of poor relation

680
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:55,730
to that maybe they were inspired by his

681
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:59,060
cotton who knows but the eye

682
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,100
the iiw so this is a conference by the

683
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,340
way has anyone do you attend one of

684
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,260
these conferences iaw if not and if you

685
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,909
are interested in identity I would

686
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,010
strongly recommend go and attend one of

687
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,530
them I'm there every six months so

688
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,730
basically twice a year normally they

689
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,080
isolate between east coast and west

690
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,060
coast at the last one which I attended

691
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,730
was in Mountain View a couple of weeks

692
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,970
ago and what they want to do is that

693
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:25,670
they want to bring in people who work

694
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,920
within the identity space and the

695
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,020
difference from what we see over here

696
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,490
let's say at last con is that you come

697
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,740
in and you have a set agenda you have

698
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,380
speakers who are already defined and you

699
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:39,920
know exactly who's given what talk in

700
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,580
what role iiw this is what they call the

701
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,640
unconference

702
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,699
and what the unconference means is that

703
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,820
there is no agenda whatsoever you just

704
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,520
show up and the agenda is created

705
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,220
dynamically and and the way it is

706
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,920
created is that there's a meeting in the

707
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,440
morning so there were 300 of us and you

708
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,570
basically gather in a big circle and

709
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,760
people propose topics and I'll show you

710
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,500
a wall where people post their topics

711
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,850
and once they are done then you

712
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,220
essentially go to any topic that

713
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,139
interests you and they are slotted by an

714
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,820
hour so you could go to one section in

715
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,990
one hour if you don't like it you move

716
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,149
out and then you go to another one

717
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,470
people basically rotate and in the

718
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,020
reason that they do that is because they

719
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:24,080
say well innovation happens like you're

720
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,420
standing and talking next to a coffee

721
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,040
machine and they want to do is that they

722
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,660
want to replicate that informal

723
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,129
environment and there are three types of

724
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,750
sessions that they have is the 101

725
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,000
session where they talk about certain

726
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,180
technology there's another session which

727
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,490
could be like okay well I have an idea

728
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,440
come listen so I'm giving you a proposal

729
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,910
come listen and then we can discuss they

730
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,320
can it can be another type of session

731
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,790
which says well I have a problem I don't

732
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,080
know how to solve it please help me

733
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,430
solve it and they are all related to

734
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,060
identity authentication access

735
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:54,830
management and you name it and from this

736
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,899
controlled chaos in the end somehow

737
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:00,290
really interesting things happen I mean

738
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,760
if you want you can go to this did this

739
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,260
URL that I have which has the session

740
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,910
session nodes from this conference and

741
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,760
you'll see what kind of things they are

742
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,440
talking about now one thing which they

743
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,720
are really proud of

744
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,250
and in fact they have that in their in

745
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,080
their logo which is endorsed by history

746
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,850
is that some of the interesting talk

747
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,740
things that we use have come out of

748
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,899
discussions that started at iiw and

749
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,179
foremost among them is the open ID

750
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:25,158
connect standard so open ID Connect

751
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:29,059
standard was picked up by open ID

752
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:32,539
foundation but it's Genesis was in iaw

753
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:34,070
many years ago so this is the example of

754
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:35,360
the wall I mean after the opening

755
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,059
session people would basically post

756
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,439
their their slots over here and and you

757
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:41,330
basically walk up to this wall and say

758
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,590
okay well what does what are they

759
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,699
talking about bill it's a distributed

760
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,980
and in these I want to attend that

761
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,240
session then you go there so a really an

762
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,830
interesting mix if you have not been

763
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,370
there highly recommend that you go and

764
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:55,789
attend now the second one I would like

765
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,830
to talk about identity defines security

766
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:00,110
alliance so here's an organized so this

767
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,059
is an alliance of companies and I'll

768
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:05,059
show you the list over here so they're

769
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:06,470
about 25 or 30 companies which all are

770
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,970
dealing with identity as you can see the

771
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:11,509
names over here and thalis is part of

772
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,580
that by the way and what we want to do

773
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:15,620
is that we want to create two types of

774
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,070
things the first one is information

775
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,719
about what recommendations we can give

776
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,340
so we can start with let's say what are

777
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,789
the best practices for identity how

778
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,500
those bad best practices can be used to

779
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:29,750
create what we call security controls

780
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,519
and then how those security controls can

781
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,559
feed into what we call the use cases so

782
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,620
essentially if you want to look at it as

783
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,389
a as a pyramid I mean you could have a

784
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,518
use case at the top which could be

785
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:42,168
addressed by multiple security controls

786
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:45,679
which underneath would have multiple

787
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:47,419
best practices so you can essentially

788
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,889
say that okay well if I do this in my

789
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:50,600
organization let's say if I impose

790
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:52,039
two-factor authentication what are the

791
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,480
different use cases which I can solve so

792
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:55,370
we are trying to build this information

793
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,470
where you can have building blocks which

794
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:01,758
then get together to form real very real

795
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,889
issues which are faced in the industry

796
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,389
and then instead of going into the

797
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:07,219
detail of this I mean I just mentioned

798
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:08,508
that this is one of the the reference

799
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,070
architectures that we have that we've

800
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:11,929
come up with where you start off with

801
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,250
the user on one end and then you need to

802
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:14,990
get to the data on the other hand and

803
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,090
what you have to go through is you go

804
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,830
through a client application or a client

805
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,870
not an application because the client

806
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,639
can have an application component a

807
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,899
compute component a storage component

808
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,010
you go through the network layer and

809
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,930
then on the other side you have the

810
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,580
server the same things and as you going

811
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,900
through each one of them the question is

812
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,179
that we want to maintain the users

813
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,860
identity to make sure that it is that

814
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,050
user which is accessing a particular

815
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,389
piece of the data so this is the overall

816
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,530
concept and then essentially underneath

817
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,540
you can see that these are the various

818
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:46,879
technology components which come in now

819
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:48,110
one way that we have used this is in the

820
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,420
publication of this white paper so

821
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,919
essentially we were looking at what

822
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,480
things that the industry really wants to

823
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,950
hear about and we realized that well

824
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,960
zero trust is something which is really

825
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,730
quite common that people want to hear

826
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,170
about in fact when I was at at RSA

827
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,400
earlier this year I mean you walk

828
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,990
through the exhibition floor and all you

829
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,470
hear are people touting that they have

830
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:08,000
zero solution I mean and the question

831
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,900
was well do people really understand

832
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,630
what zero trust is and when we step back

833
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,860
a little we realize that well there are

834
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,480
two kinds of literature that you will

835
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,949
find on zero trust there is one which is

836
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,200
coming from let's see Google when they

837
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,880
publish the original beyond cope paper

838
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,830
about almost ten years ago or now and

839
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,290
then you have other literature which

840
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,270
says that okay I'm an enterprise I use

841
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:34,100
this paper and I implemented zero trust

842
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:36,110
and here's my my my case study there's

843
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,090
very little of other information out

844
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:40,669
there and what we wanted to do was that

845
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,889
given the expertise that we have in IDSA

846
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:46,850
from all these 25 organizations we want

847
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:49,040
to have a collective output of what zero

848
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,360
trust is for two things one was okay

849
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,629
well let's try to move the focus away

850
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,340
from networks set centric representation

851
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,040
of zero trust is something which is more

852
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,750
identity centric and and secondly of

853
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,700
course because the more Minds you put

854
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,550
together the better output you get so

855
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,200
that's one work that we did the second

856
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:08,060
one is more an integration of how

857
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,710
building blocks from one company can

858
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,970
complement the building blocks of

859
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,160
another so why I mentioned okay well

860
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,660
pink is strong and single sign-on but at

861
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,040
the same time we have access management

862
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,800
and multi-factor authentication

863
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,360
solutions which could be coming from

864
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Dallas and we could have Pam solution

865
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,120
let's say the privileged access

866
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,030
management solution which could be

867
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,189
coming from let's say beyond trust so so

868
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,720
on that I mean we have a talk which

869
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,310
talks specifically about that so if

870
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,690
you're interested we can I can point you

871
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:37,460
to that talk the next item is

872
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:42,650
the continued success evaluation

873
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:46,340
protocol and this is a new initiative

874
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,930
which is still a bit Nessen t' but i

875
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,000
think there's strong progress going on

876
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,200
in industry so before i explain i mean

877
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,780
who are the players who are working on

878
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,820
this let's find out why do we need cape

879
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,379
they've introduced indication so if you

880
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,970
look at this model so this is what we

881
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,440
have at the end of the Federation so you

882
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,540
have the identity provided in the middle

883
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,130
the user the the company and then the

884
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,480
service provider but the story doesn't

885
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,090
stop here I mean the user could be

886
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,850
connected to let's say for other or five

887
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,699
other service providers and what we want

888
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:15,260
to find out in order to have a good

889
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,790
implementation of zero trust is that if

890
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,720
something goes wrong in one of these

891
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:20,000
service providers

892
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,370
how would that information be reflected

893
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,140
in my session with the first service

894
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,610
provider now the first subscriber may

895
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,100
not want to know what exactly I did

896
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:30,679
wrong on SB five but the fact that

897
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,270
something went wrong on SP five now puts

898
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,030
into question the session that I have is

899
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,370
the first service word and we are trying

900
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,620
to do most of it right now

901
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,600
but it's hard to do in the absence of a

902
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,100
standard so funston's if i want to

903
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,750
implement everything on the service why

904
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,610
decide itself the service while it's the

905
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,200
burden is on the service water to make

906
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:52,429
sure that it monitors all my activities

907
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:55,250
and that's hard to do so with that in

908
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,900
mind the reason that the the Cape comes

909
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:00,050
into picture is that okay well we want

910
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:02,000
to focus on zero trust we want to make

911
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,620
sure that the attack focus as we know

912
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,650
that it's shifting from the network to

913
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,899
the endpoint compromises we also know

914
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,340
that context matters because it's not

915
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,110
just the roc-a-fella of authenticated

916
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,570
you at the parameter you want to do that

917
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,850
continuously throughout the lifecycle of

918
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,800
the session which means that the context

919
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,330
sensitive information as we talked about

920
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
in access management earlier they are

921
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,480
important and the question is how do we

922
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,250
implement them and then at the same time

923
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,200
they're multiple sources I mean I could

924
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,970
be logged in from my laptop so the

925
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,520
security posture of the laptop is in

926
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,410
question I could have used my phone as a

927
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,150
second factor device so the security

928
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,700
posture of this phone is in is in

929
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:40,280
question I'm right now going over a VPN

930
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,350
which is provided by PI by the Knowledge

931
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,570
Center and I'm connected so all of these

932
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,189
things I mean you could have information

933
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,110
which could be compromised at each of

934
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,450
these layers and the question is that

935
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,620
how do you address that

936
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,150
which essentially points us to the fact

937
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,409
that well right now there is no solution

938
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,890
which will which will do that

939
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,540
so what Cape does is that it creates

940
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:03,560
this concept of publishers and

941
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:05,659
subscribers so essentially a publisher

942
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,630
will say okay has a user that I know

943
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,090
about and this user is doing certain

944
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:14,929
things and I'll send out events whenever

945
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:16,669
something bad happens the subscriber

946
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,730
would say okay well I want to know about

947
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,960
this user and I'm subscribing to all the

948
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,300
events that you are that you're

949
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,790
publishing so the model is very simple

950
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,260
of course the details are i'm the devil

951
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:30,080
is in the details on how the protocol is

952
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,090
set up but the from the concept point if

953
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,069
you publish your subscriber express

954
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,600
interest and then based upon the signals

955
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,679
that you get have a policy engine which

956
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:41,449
will decide what to do so one example of

957
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,720
that the way we can put it in context is

958
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:46,460
that you start from here from a device

959
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,168
and you connect into a reliant relying

960
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,580
party let's assume that authentication

961
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:51,529
has been done now you are essentially

962
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,560
engaging with the session back and forth

963
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,330
with the service the service provider or

964
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,460
the rank party normally what happens is

965
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,220
you send in a request in our response

966
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,590
comes back with either what you have

967
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,419
asked for or a rejection saying that

968
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,720
well you can't have this for blah blah

969
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:12,350
blah whatever it is now in order to make

970
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,029
this robust and continuous the onus is

971
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:17,240
on the relying party to manage all the

972
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,860
signals what Cape offers is that it

973
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,720
introduces this concept of publishers

974
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,110
and subscribers so now the relying party

975
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,540
can say well first of all I will tell

976
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,550
somebody else or I'll broadcast that

977
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:32,150
this is what this user has done for this

978
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:34,220
session again I mean the the identity of

979
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,810
the user and the and the privacy and

980
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,819
exactly the details about what is done

981
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:41,630
is still maintained but you could

982
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:42,680
articulate in a more abstract way that

983
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,320
this is something which has happened

984
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,089
which is bad on the policy server side

985
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,030
the policy server could be getting the

986
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:53,540
same information from other subscribers

987
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:55,340
or other publishers and what comes back

988
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,620
is a much more rich set of information

989
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,840
to the relying party which the run party

990
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,660
by itself could not have obtained so

991
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,240
these two back and forth

992
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,080
remain as they are what K provides is

993
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,600
the server-to-server communication

994
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,220
between multiple nodes so that they can

995
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,720
share the information about a particular

996
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:17,810
user now I said that this is fairly

997
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,100
nascent and ed and just starting to come

998
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,210
into force and in fact I mean it has I

999
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,060
mean right now the momentum is pretty

1000
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:26,060
strong but where it started off was one

1001
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:30,440
blog that was posted by Atul toshi from

1002
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:32,960
Google and and this got a lot of

1003
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,150
attention from a lot of companies and so

1004
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,620
far what we've had is that after this

1005
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,630
blog there was one presentation done

1006
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:41,839
that was done earlier this year at odd

1007
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:44,360
intervals and since then we've had to

1008
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:50,540
face to face meetings both hosted by

1009
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:53,810
Google and it is now part of standards

1010
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,240
body under open ID foundation so just

1011
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,610
like Open ID Connect is under Open ID

1012
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,740
foundation and that's a standard

1013
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:05,000
similarly the Cape effort is now

1014
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:08,450
officially part of Open ID Foundation in

1015
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,250
terms of the players here are about 12

1016
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,279
or 13 companies which are actively

1017
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,420
participating in this in the standard

1018
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:18,130
terraces again one of them I am

1019
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:20,300
representing the terrace team in in this

1020
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,220
development of standards but then as you

1021
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,920
can see I mean the other ones Google

1022
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,390
Microsoft of topping do I mean all the

1023
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,660
major players in that entity space there

1024
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:31,609
they are they're what we feel is that

1025
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,890
it'll probably take another year and a

1026
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,830
half to two years before it becomes a

1027
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,330
standard and so far all the input that

1028
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:41,450
we have received from the Open ID

1029
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:44,210
foundation board who know a thing or two

1030
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:46,580
about how standards work is that there's

1031
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,410
a lot of need for this kind of a

1032
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,200
standardized way of communication and

1033
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,879
even exchange between between parties to

1034
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,629
help with the authentication the

1035
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,210
continuous with indication space so the

1036
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,070
need seems to be there the will seems to

1037
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:03,140
be there from from from these these

1038
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,300
organizations in fact the one the two of

1039
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,040
the more the the more promoters of this

1040
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,070
are Google and Microsoft I mean it's not

1041
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,220
that they are there just to put a face

1042
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:15,980
to the standard but they are the ones

1043
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:19,069
were one of the more actively involved

1044
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:22,130
participants and in fact that's why so

1045
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,690
the first two face-to-face meetings were

1046
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,480
held in in in the Mountain View office

1047
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,800
of Google rather Senna Mirotic and then

1048
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,790
the next one which is coming up in three

1049
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,620
weeks will be in Seattle

1050
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,380
hosted by Microsoft so the standard is

1051
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:35,750
shape taking shape but it's still about

1052
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:37,010
a year and a half to two years away so

1053
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,350
if you are more interested in this I

1054
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,820
mean please get in touch with me and and

1055
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,620
we would like to have more participation

1056
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,580
in it more companies that join in that

1057
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:48,140
energy space I think it is it is good

1058
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,580
but what everybody feels is that once

1059
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,940
the standard is done then the next

1060
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:55,069
frontier would be the implementation

1061
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,680
because it could be a complex

1062
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,210
implementation in terms of how to manage

1063
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,919
the signals how to make sure that the

1064
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,770
protocol is such that it doesn't become

1065
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,150
too chatty that not that many message is

1066
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,710
going back and forth because thing

1067
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:10,520
things happen at a very fast pace and

1068
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:13,130
people feel that the machine running an

1069
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,300
AI would it would have a strong presence

1070
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,340
in this because you want to create your

1071
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,350
competitive solutions and the and the

1072
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,940
parties which are most interested in

1073
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,500
that we which are highlight a bit I mean

1074
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,360
or not because I mean they're most

1075
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
interested but more because they're they

1076
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,720
have the muscle to carry this forward

1077
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,090
because of the resources and the amount

1078
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,640
of money that they're spending in a I so

1079
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:33,830
so with that said let's look at how a I

1080
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,950
would come into picture in not only

1081
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:38,299
caper but what other flavors so

1082
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,890
artificial intelligence and machine

1083
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,840
learning I mean this is again a buzzword

1084
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,089
so again at all I see another conference

1085
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,320
is zero trust was one buzzword machine

1086
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,760
learning was the other so people

1087
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,810
basically put that on their brochures

1088
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,490
even if they don't know what it means

1089
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:51,410
which is fine because I mean this is

1090
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,419
something which is which is involved and

1091
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,649
and for a reason I mean people are doing

1092
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,270
really great things with their with this

1093
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,740
but I just thought that okay well before

1094
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,360
we talk about that let's take a step

1095
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,680
back and I would like to give you a

1096
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,600
little bit a little bit of a history see

1097
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:06,169
okay well where it all started so this

1098
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:09,819
is Marvin Marvin Minsky he passed away

1099
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:12,890
in 2016 one of the founders of AI and

1100
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,930
really smart guy got his education in

1101
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,940
Princeton and Harvard got the Turing

1102
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:20,750
Award which is given by the ACM annually

1103
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:22,920
and he actually started the artificial

1104
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:25,349
and the AI laboratory it at Mi

1105
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,190
and not only started that laboratory but

1106
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:32,220
worked very closely with the the Media

1107
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:33,809
Lab the MIT Media Lab and this is where

1108
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,308
a lot of ground waiting research has

1109
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:36,960
been happening for the last many decades

1110
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:39,630
and they are still on the forefront of

1111
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,769
what what they do in AI and if you want

1112
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,539
to learn more about that time there's a

1113
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:46,049
very nice book about the Media Lab

1114
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:47,490
inventing the future by by Stewart Brand

1115
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:48,779
I mean this is a fairly old book but I

1116
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,848
think they have a more recent version of

1117
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,950
that as well this cover is from from

1118
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:54,599
from the older version the reason that I

1119
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,390
brought this up was because in this book

1120
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:59,670
I found very interesting note from from

1121
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,730
Minsky so they talk about what they call

1122
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:04,140
the Minsky challenge and but the Minsky

1123
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,670
challenge is that okay well he posed

1124
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,200
this to his graduate students in okay

1125
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,289
well you are building this massively

1126
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,379
parallel connection machine see if you

1127
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:16,319
can write an algorithm where you can

1128
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,839
differentiate a cat from a doll so this

1129
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,339
was the early days of AI we were talking

1130
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
about well what what do what to do and

1131
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:25,619
the reason that this is important is

1132
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,380
because what we feel sometimes is that

1133
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,240
money is following the research that

1134
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,099
they would basically invest in research

1135
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,629
which is interesting in the hopes that

1136
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,359
it will basically render more

1137
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,440
interesting things but in reality

1138
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,700
sometimes you wonder the problems are

1139
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,369
the way wrong especially when we see

1140
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,859
what's happening in the current time

1141
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:47,579
where research is following where the

1142
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:49,200
money is and it's trying to make it's

1143
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:51,029
trying to optimize already existing

1144
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,680
revenue streams and we see that in how

1145
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:57,059
we how the companies are approaching AI

1146
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:58,558
currently and machine learning so with

1147
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,869
that I mean since money and research

1148
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,490
they're so close so closely tied

1149
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:05,279
together I wanted to give you a little

1150
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:07,500
perspective of how what are the most

1151
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:08,940
variable companies today and then how it

1152
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,160
has changed over time so we can say we

1153
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,329
can start from 1980 and an IBM is the

1154
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,460
only technology company that you see

1155
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:18,450
there the rest of them are telecom and

1156
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:21,990
an oil to oil companies when oil

1157
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:24,960
services company and ten years later IBM

1158
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:27,109
is still there AT&T has gone because

1159
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,670
it's been broken up by the by the FCC

1160
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:31,619
into into baby bells but now we have

1161
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:34,950
pretty much the same mix and then same

1162
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:36,080
thing continues in 2000 cisco is not

1163
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,460
there because of the

1164
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,380
dot-com boom as we talked about the

1165
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,820
routers are in vogue and everybody wants

1166
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,380
one so of course that boosts the stock

1167
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,520
of the company but the rest of it is

1168
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,780
still there I mean we have General

1169
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,100
Electric but it's not really a

1170
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,210
technology company it's it's an

1171
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,310
appliance company so you would not

1172
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:54,290
associate that and but then we have

1173
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:57,920
pharmaceutical and then we have finance

1174
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:59,750
and then oil is still there in 2010

1175
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,440
things tend to change a bit I mean

1176
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:04,790
Microsoft and Apple are coming up the

1177
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,590
rest of the mix is still the same

1178
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,270
I mean General Electric is there there's

1179
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:10,970
a financial company both for Berkshire

1180
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:13,970
Hathaway and then oil is still present

1181
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:15,140
so so this is every 10 years but now 10

1182
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,540
years has not even passed I mean it's

1183
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:20,359
from 2010 and we're not there at 2:20

1184
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,410
and these numbers are for 2017 and

1185
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,810
already you can see that there is a

1186
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,970
clean sweep all the top five companies

1187
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:28,970
are technology companies what we refer

1188
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:32,720
to as the form these days Apple Google

1189
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,830
Microsoft Facebook and Amazon and the

1190
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,379
question is where they're spending their

1191
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:38,210
money so we talked about the

1192
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,720
interconnect between research and money

1193
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:44,390
and the money is all going into the risk

1194
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,770
for AI so this is just a snapshot of

1195
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,960
some of the acquisitions that they've

1196
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:49,910
done over the course of the years and

1197
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,980
and indeed these are not small

1198
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,940
accusations I mean some other

1199
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,530
acquisitions are basically investing in

1200
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,300
startups and some of these are really

1201
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,550
massive so for instance when you look at

1202
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,770
why Microsoft is doing with open AI so

1203
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:02,720
that's a 1 billion dollar investment and

1204
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,980
in the reason that they're doing that is

1205
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,750
because on the server side they want to

1206
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,120
reap the benefits of manipulating

1207
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,010
machine learning and in here and and by

1208
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,569
the way this the the reason that I mean

1209
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,830
open era is interesting is not because

1210
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,020
they are simulating things and they

1211
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:18,170
they're doing things in software but

1212
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,490
they're doing things in in the physical

1213
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,770
world as well so essentially they can

1214
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,020
translate the the complexities of a

1215
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:26,180
simulation into into the physical world

1216
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,650
of the hand movement of a robot so

1217
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,190
here's a robot that can actually solve a

1218
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,590
Rubik's Cube

1219
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,090
so you basically give drop the Rubik's

1220
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,670
Cube in its form and basically turn it

1221
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,740
on and then before you know it will be

1222
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,480
solved so here's the the frontier of

1223
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,979
where we are heading and it's not just

1224
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,210
the the private sector which is doing

1225
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,250
that I mean we have we see the same

1226
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,540
thing happening on the by the Department

1227
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:48,620
of Defense and generally

1228
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:49,670
DoD has turned to the defense

1229
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,500
contractors to do this

1230
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,690
for it but in the case of air they are

1231
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,960
turning to the technology companies like

1232
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:59,089
like Google and Amazon now at the same

1233
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,799
time I mean people do point out that of

1234
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:02,299
course I mean AI is still in the infancy

1235
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,220
to some extent and there are glitches

1236
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,990
that happen so this one was reported in

1237
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,209
MIT Technology Review which they talked

1238
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:12,169
about the the deep learning vision

1239
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:14,180
algorithm that DoD was using it could be

1240
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,069
fooled into thinking that the turtle is

1241
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,569
a rifle now for everybody else I mean

1242
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:18,950
the image to the left is a turtle but

1243
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:21,950
when that helgerson looks at that that

1244
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:23,990
comes back repeatedly with the assertion

1245
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,430
that that's right though and what some

1246
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:27,919
people point out is that that's because

1247
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,750
of our deep reliance on what we call the

1248
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,549
deep learning so just a little bit of a

1249
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,319
synopsis of what deep learning really

1250
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:35,119
means so when you look at the artificial

1251
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:37,250
intelligence concept I mean so these are

1252
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,880
layers sort of alien context yeah AI is

1253
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,960
the top layer where we say okay well you

1254
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,880
do some things to the computer to the

1255
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,530
software and as long as it output is

1256
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,510
smart you would call that here so that's

1257
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:50,809
a very broad area and it has been around

1258
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:52,549
for years and my when Marvin Minsky

1259
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:54,680
created their lab at MIT that was

1260
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:56,359
decades ago so the concept has been

1261
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,759
around and some people think that that's

1262
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:00,140
old hat not because the word has been

1263
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,750
around and there's a very little to show

1264
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:04,940
for it so they say okay well let's think

1265
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,770
of something else so from the marketers

1266
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,270
point of view machine learning is catchy

1267
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,069
in that respect because it's a new

1268
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,569
phrase and people latch on to that so

1269
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:12,710
that's why when you hear people say they

1270
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:14,839
talk about machine learning they don't

1271
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:16,910
talk about AI most of the literature's

1272
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:18,950
and what we feel learning does is this

1273
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,509
the current implementation of AI and the

1274
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:24,589
focus for them is okay give me a set of

1275
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:26,210
data structure data and then guide me on

1276
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:27,558
how to make sense of it and then how to

1277
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,760
make predictions about the future so

1278
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:30,770
that's essentially machine learning

1279
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,599
learning from past information and then

1280
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,730
moving forward deep learning on the

1281
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,829
other hand is is more even more focused

1282
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,180
than that it says okay where's give me

1283
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:40,339
the data and by the way that data

1284
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:43,040
doesn't have to be structured just like

1285
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,390
that totally and I'll figure it out what

1286
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,369
it is and by the way don't even hold my

1287
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:47,540
hand I can do things on my own and the

1288
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:48,859
reason that they're doing that in deep

1289
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,540
learning is because they want to mimic

1290
00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:55,880
the neural networks of how humans behave

1291
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:57,319
and that is always hard to do of course

1292
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,000
I mean eventually we will get there but

1293
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:01,670
right now the algorithms that we have

1294
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,500
are a little a little off and the

1295
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,730
question is why does that matter

1296
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,200
he started off with the identity with

1297
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:08,000
his education then we talked about Cape

1298
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,790
and we said okay well in the Cape a

1299
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,869
framework machine learning would be

1300
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:16,640
important and we need that but it's not

1301
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:20,780
just authentication and an access

1302
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:24,230
management I mean the use of AI now and

1303
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:25,760
in future transcends everything I mean

1304
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,230
you can look at each of these things

1305
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,240
from quality admission all the way to

1306
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,740
the role in the criminal justice system

1307
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,180
everything would be driven and

1308
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:34,939
controlled by the algorithms which are

1309
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:36,950
created and the question is that well

1310
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,240
how would that work so for instance um

1311
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:40,009
if you take the example of the corporate

1312
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,569
promotion so let's say you have an

1313
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,010
algorithm of picking somebody for

1314
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,230
promotion and you want to pick that

1315
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:47,810
person for a promotion based upon the

1316
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,609
prediction of how much how successful

1317
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,529
that person would be if you're using

1318
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:54,140
data from the past then you look at the

1319
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:56,450
data and you say aha well what I see is

1320
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,700
that well in the past historically white

1321
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,689
males have been very dominant in the

1322
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,330
corporate world and they have been

1323
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:04,460
successful so now the algorithm is

1324
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,930
biased towards picking a white male for

1325
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,359
promotion and that's what people have

1326
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:10,609
pointed out repeatedly in multiple

1327
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:12,619
studies where the AI algorithms are

1328
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:14,720
biased and people realize that they are

1329
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:17,930
but the question is how to fix them and

1330
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,669
and that's where the the the notion of

1331
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:21,169
well do the deep learning but at the

1332
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,170
same time take it with a grain of salt

1333
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:26,390
and one book we shared recently found

1334
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,760
I've not read this book yet by the way

1335
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:31,460
full disclaimer but it looks interesting

1336
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,930
I mean the reviews are pretty good by by

1337
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,640
Gary Marcus I mean he's the professor at

1338
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,680
New York University and founder of a

1339
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,790
couple of AI startups that that he

1340
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:44,029
created and what he argues as the title

1341
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:46,550
reflects in adding trust to AI because

1342
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:49,910
currently the software that is used to

1343
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:53,030
do AI it does not have the trust of the

1344
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:54,319
users and one reason for that could be

1345
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,170
because when we talk about trust

1346
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,180
its affiliated and associated with

1347
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:02,420
humans I mean you trust humans because

1348
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:04,640
you have rapport with them the same

1349
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,410
trust does not transcend into machines

1350
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,480
and software as yet because we've seen

1351
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,910
these glitches that the algorithms do

1352
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,530
this is a very interesting clip about if

1353
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,660
you search for data explains more talk

1354
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:16,380
so so data is basically trying to be

1355
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,089
human and he says okay well

1356
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,849
it's more talk is something that humans

1357
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:22,819
do quite casually and any basically

1358
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:25,410
tries to do something and then says well

1359
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:27,808
I've written this subroutine to do that

1360
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:30,960
and how do I do and Picard says well

1361
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:33,299
it's a little too irrelevant so if you

1362
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,829
really want to do if you're really

1363
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:37,170
interested in small talk then you should

1364
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:38,789
observe commander Hutchinson and

1365
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,739
commoditization is the commander of the

1366
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:43,319
of the base that they're that they are

1367
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:45,930
at and I suspect that you go in and

1368
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:48,329
observe him and how he does smart as a

1369
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:50,279
small talk because he's a master and and

1370
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:51,569
the other says are will and and that's

1371
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:54,180
machine learning for you because now

1372
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:56,038
he'll there so if you if you look for

1373
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:59,098
this search for this people to be it'll

1374
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:01,109
be nice as a closing thought so thank

1375
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:03,440
thank you very much you've been a you've

1376
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:11,199
been great audience and thanks a lot

1377
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:11,199
[Applause]

1378
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,270
you
