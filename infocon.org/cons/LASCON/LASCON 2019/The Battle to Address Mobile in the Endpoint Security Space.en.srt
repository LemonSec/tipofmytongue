2
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:42,210
hi everyone um today we're gonna be

3
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,250
talking about three main things the

4
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,470
first of which is the importance of

5
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,700
respecting mobile because it is really

6
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,100
important and it's not something the

7
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,840
endpoint security spaces doing as much

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,230
right now the second thing is about

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,030
education because education for people

10
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,489
in endpoint security around mobile is

11
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,489
very limited as it stands right now and

12
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,199
then the third is convenience which I

13
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,869
think all of you know because security

14
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,750
is basically ruled by convenience and by

15
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:13,410
users choosing convenience over security

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,240
so feel free to ask any questions and to

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,410
raise your hand just to speak out I

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,440
don't want to just get up here and

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,570
pontificate for a little while so I'll

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,110
start with a question who in here is in

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,940
security who's a security professional

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:32,340
how about mobile developers and

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:36,060
application developers okay cool

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,340
we got a good mix makes me happy um a

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,069
little about me my name is Ali melon

26
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,140
this picture was taken six years ago at

27
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,009
dub dub Worldwide Developer Conference

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,310
in San Francisco I spend a lot of time

29
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,500
writing iOS apps and they were mostly

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,630
about education and I also spent some

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,640
time teaching people how to code for iOS

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,990
when I was in college my favorite

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,580
language is always gonna be objective-c

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,589
sorry Swifties but um a couple years

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,560
later I did some security research and

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,780
fell in love with cybersecurity and then

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,209
became an engineering consultant before

38
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,250
becoming a writer for cyber reason all

39
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:18,270
about our security research and thought

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,340
leadership around security um back when

41
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,380
that photo was taken I did not care

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,120
about security at all and I was

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,590
developing apps that thousands of people

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,770
were downloading um developing apps was

45
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:37,790
really accessible security was not it

46
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:41,940
arguably still isn't and I'm not alone

47
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,790
this is a pervasive issue of

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,370
the 50 of the world's top 100 banks

49
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:51,620
every single one had at least one

50
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:54,480
security vulnerability that's right now

51
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,300
this is in the case of financial

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,100
institutions which are protecting some

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,110
of the most valuable assets for hackers

54
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:06,570
to access so why do you think this is

55
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:09,030
does anyone have thoughts on why this

56
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,340
happens why all of these have security

57
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,450
vulnerabilities why that's acceptable

58
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,610
grace to get into the market yeah

59
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,880
absolutely

60
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:23,310
anything else I see it breaking down

61
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,079
into four things first race to get in

62
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,410
the market deadlines and development

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,320
shortcuts so developers their metrics

64
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,290
are all based around getting competitive

65
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,700
features out they don't worry as much

66
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,679
about security if anything it's just

67
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,959
pulling them back they're forced to move

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,150
fast and they choose to put out code

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,450
instead of putting out secure code the

70
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,330
next is just platform familiarity mobile

71
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,950
platforms don't have the same broad

72
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:53,070
standardization the desktop ones do and

73
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,140
so you can make apps for a platform with

74
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,730
having very little knowledge about it

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,809
and then distribute those across

76
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:04,530
platforms even in contrast for me for

77
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,209
example I was exclusively iOS I did very

78
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,310
little Android not the type of thing

79
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:14,220
that I could possibly get paid for and

80
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,858
so it just like pigeonholes you in order

81
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,329
to understand enough about the platform

82
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,810
to understand the security behind the

83
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,190
platform the next is consumers and I

84
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,220
don't want to like make a point of

85
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,990
blaming consumers because security needs

86
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,930
to be simple for them and it needs to be

87
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,430
accessible for them convenience is king

88
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,580
but some just aren't gonna install the

89
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,410
updates I have a friend he has a degree

90
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,250
in Computer Engineering we did security

91
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,850
research together

92
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:46,080
he refuses to update he is two versions

93
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,850
behind every other iPhone and like yeah

94
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,050
he's a technical guy he has a degree in

95
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,740
Computer Engineering he works at Google

96
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,080
but it just he won't do it and he

97
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,819
understands the risks

98
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,919
and then others they don't even use pass

99
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:08,020
codes to lock their phones so that's

100
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:10,639
like an automatic yeah great question

101
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,430
yeah cuz I'm asking that something like

102
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,639
we think um he doesn't want to deal with

103
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,729
the bugs yeah he doesn't want to update

104
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,889
and not be able to access some apps that

105
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:25,550
he likes he doesn't want to update and

106
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:27,259
run the risk of like just not being able

107
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,270
to use his phone anymore he likes things

108
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:33,830
how they are and he doesn't want to

109
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:36,770
change that not a great reason but at

110
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:41,060
the same time I don't like change all

111
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,340
the time and then the last one is kind

112
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,940
of funny it sounds stupid but legacy

113
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,369
code it sounds dumb because smartphones

114
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,380
are still so new but the last thing I

115
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,030
would want to do is be a swift developer

116
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,050
and come into an environment that's like

117
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,210
half objective-c

118
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,409
you just don't want to deal with it you

119
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,229
don't want to have to worry about

120
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,729
bridging it becomes a mess and this was

121
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,859
something that I was facing even as I

122
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,590
stepped out of development and moved

123
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:12,860
into security which was like four years

124
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:15,349
ago um so these are all of the reasons

125
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,909
why from a developer perspective but

126
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:18,680
what we're gonna be looking at today is

127
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:23,300
the endpoint side of things the endpoint

128
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,979
security side of things so for someone

129
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,990
in the endpoint security space what is

130
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,840
mobile what does that mean

131
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,490
what does that break down to do you guys

132
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,758
have thoughts like what would you

133
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:40,870
pinpoint mobile ass

134
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,870
I'll watch iPhone laptop

135
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,969
because laptops are where things get a

136
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:48,139
little bit confusing because it's still

137
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:51,889
considered like a pretty traditional

138
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:55,339
endpoint so we kind of focus on mobile

139
00:06:51,889 --> 00:07:00,139
as iPhone smartphones and laptops and

140
00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:01,939
tablets and they say a lot that these

141
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,550
things are secure but they're not the

142
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:06,439
marketing can't back it up they have

143
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:11,059
this ad but is it true

144
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:13,189
not at all not at all um take the latest

145
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:16,729
Google zero-day five exploit chains

146
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:19,759
across iOS 10 to 12 end up with 14

147
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:22,279
vulnerabilities and they're able to

148
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,860
monitor individuals with root access on

149
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:28,360
the machine did that sound like apples

150
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,360
living up to their marketing promises

151
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:35,389
absolutely no reason Anson how many of

152
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,419
you have corporate data on your phone

153
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:43,909
right now

154
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:45,409
through emails I do I was reading a

155
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:48,649
customer email on the right over here

156
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:50,270
it's just a reality of convenience most

157
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:53,629
people do and companies are starting to

158
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,758
recognize it 60% of devices containing

159
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:58,639
or accessing enterprise data are mobile

160
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,680
this isn't surprising and it screams the

161
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,509
need for endpoint security to respect

162
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,279
mobile and take it seriously 75% of

163
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,409
enterprises have bring your own device

164
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,889
policies in place you're trying to

165
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:14,300
defend something you didn't even issue

166
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,789
it's all about convenience for people

167
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,149
that's the reason these policies exists

168
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:22,279
and honestly I don't want to carry

169
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:24,709
around a corporate phone and a personal

170
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,449
phone inevitably I'm gonna forget one

171
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,279
one's gonna run a battery I'm gonna need

172
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,020
to do something either personal or work

173
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:34,849
on the other phone and you're gonna end

174
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:36,318
up with cross-contamination anyway so

175
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,930
what does this break down to an

176
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:41,088
enterprise large majority or bring your

177
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,888
own devices and then you have company

178
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,970
owned devices and then smaller it's like

179
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:50,240
custom devices like point-of-sale the

180
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:53,340
bring your own is more than any other

181
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,810
what's the risk corporate assets are

182
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,330
scattered across these bring your own

183
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,979
devices all of these things can be

184
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,390
leveraged by attackers in different ways

185
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,400
personal data that can be blackmail

186
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,680
monitoring is monitoring like that one's

187
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,810
a given and then corporate assets can be

188
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,000
blackmail or used for money more

189
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,729
commonly but is this a legitimate

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,980
concern what do i tackers have to work

191
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:22,380
with 83% of senior professionals think

192
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,970
it is an issue and I think it's an issue

193
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,770
I think most teams agree that it is an

194
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,580
issue so what makes it particularly

195
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:32,130
daunting break down the mobile threats

196
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,930
into four different categories user

197
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,150
behavior application threats device

198
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,979
threats and network threats and I'm

199
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,449
going to go into some quick examples of

200
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,040
each just to give you an idea of how

201
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:45,030
easy this is let's look at behavior

202
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,650
first of all just because it's user

203
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,930
behavior doesn't mean it's the users

204
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,910
fault and I think that's important to

205
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:56,520
convey because we need to make it easy

206
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:58,319
for them convenience's King again user

207
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,199
behavior breaks down into things like

208
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,420
breaking policy I'm using a corporate

209
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,160
device for your personal use clicking on

210
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,290
a malicious link giving apps extra

211
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:12,750
permissions that they don't need classic

212
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:14,310
the example of this is fishing over two

213
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,080
fifths of senior professionals that

214
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,250
experience a mobile related compromised

215
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,540
say it involved fishing

216
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,820
surprise-surprise

217
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,640
enterprise users are three times more

218
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:29,250
likely to fall for a phishing link went

219
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,790
on a small screen laptop okay it's kind

220
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,410
of crazy

221
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,150
especially because whenever I get a

222
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,189
phishing email and I'm on my phone I

223
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,900
just clicked the contact up at the top

224
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,360
and see all of those numbers and letters

225
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,760
from for the email address and I'm like

226
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,770
yeah okay but I can kind of understand

227
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,920
it because the immediacy that mobile

228
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,329
devices bring you it's you just want to

229
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,750
take care of things more fast more

230
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,430
quickly so coming from an enterprise

231
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,190
security background your immediate

232
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,680
thought is that this is linked to emails

233
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,940
that you have emails coming in 66% of

234
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,969
emails are first open on the mobile

235
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:08,160
device and then the question becomes is

236
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,470
that actually where the issue is because

237
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,420
I'm making this assumption coming from

238
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,350
an enterprise background where phishing

239
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,930
attacks a lot

240
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,010
vast majority happen over email that

241
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,290
that's where they come from but on

242
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,050
mobile devices it's different it's not

243
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,540
all about email and this is what I mean

244
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,130
about educating people are coming in to

245
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,020
the mobile space from the endpoint

246
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,910
security space and making assumptions

247
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,480
that just don't hold up in an enterprise

248
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,969
setting so only 15 percent of phishing

249
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,680
attacks happened through email for

250
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,360
mobile and the rest come from things

251
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,770
like social media productivity apps

252
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,740
messaging apps games anybody ever get

253
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:50,579
this text someone has your photos from

254
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,170
what's up and now they are here that's a

255
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:57,480
little like it makes you panic a little

256
00:11:52,170 --> 00:12:00,030
it's not a great moment and then the

257
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,830
other thing is access permissions how

258
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,360
many people download an app and it says

259
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,340
that they want permissions and they just

260
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,430
like click OK because they don't want to

261
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,720
worry about it many apps have access to

262
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,109
things they don't need you can't tell me

263
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,330
that 39% edye close to the microphone

264
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:19,740
but developers do this because it's

265
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:22,190
convenient ask for the permissions now

266
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,540
and then use them however you need later

267
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,730
instead of like updating one time and

268
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,280
then it asks them to give permissions

269
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,710
it's a bad user experience it's better

270
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:36,260
to just have all the access you want now

271
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:39,120
but it goes even deeper than that

272
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,970
90% of Android apps request home network

273
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,160
access tell me what they need that for

274
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:47,490
they don't but they do

275
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,980
and even 12% of Android apps request

276
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,380
access to modify system settings it's

277
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,620
just convenience developers want it

278
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,910
because they can have it and users a lot

279
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,520
of times they're just like whatever I

280
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,860
can trust it it's just my phone what's

281
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,490
important on here anyway even though

282
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:09,200
it's a device that's with them 24/7

283
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:10,760
uh next up is application threats

284
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,160
application threats are things like

285
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,880
malicious apps enterprise apps with

286
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,189
coding practices wasp actually has a

287
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,320
great top 10 ways cyber criminals

288
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,320
compromised mobile apps they can look at

289
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,640
70% of organizations have a custom app

290
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,080
and half of them over half of them are

291
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,300
worried about insecure coding

292
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,080
anybody here are part of an organization

293
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:39,729
that has a custom app how confident do

294
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,330
you feel about it security perspective I

295
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:51,680
won't tell anyone

296
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:53,630
oh and what's your company's name 80% of

297
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,430
malicious apps have access to internal

298
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,620
network center scanning nearby ports so

299
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,750
you're finding that these malicious apps

300
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,820
they don't just want to get on the

301
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,830
device they want to go somewhere else

302
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,160
they want to get access to something

303
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,589
else which makes total sense but the

304
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,300
important thing to think about is how

305
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:15,860
likely is this to actually happen is

306
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,810
this really gonna happen turns out for

307
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,940
enterprises with a hundred to 250

308
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,949
devices there's a five percent

309
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,360
likelihood that this will happen not bad

310
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,870
you can take that risk

311
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,560
but as you get higher up so do the

312
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,630
numbers with a thousand to 2500 device

313
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,290
company it's a 40 percent likelihood a

314
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:39,920
huge jump then you get up into the 5,000

315
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:43,849
to 9,000 s 85% likelihood that at least

316
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,569
one device has a malicious app then once

317
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:50,300
you get over 10,000 it's 97% larger

318
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:54,130
enterprises it's just a reality that

319
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,130
they have to face this is a problem

320
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:01,250
now we're gonna look at some device

321
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,290
stuff this is stuff like devices going

322
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,670
missing and again updating the operating

323
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,819
system which a lot of people just don't

324
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,229
do 57% of Android devices we're running

325
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,110
an operating system at least two

326
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,360
versions behind that's terrible

327
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:19,160
this equates to 507 known

328
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,880
vulnerabilities per device 507 it's

329
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,400
crazy

330
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:27,470
with nearly 2/3 of those rated critical

331
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:30,829
or high risk anybody here not keep their

332
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:35,480
phone up-to-date and it wants to admit

333
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:38,210
it I update mine sometimes I regret it

334
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,820
because things stopped working I just

335
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:44,180
upgraded to Catalina because I liked the

336
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,920
name better and that was a huge mistake

337
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:51,530
half of my things don't work that's a

338
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:54,680
laptop but still same thing um yeah and

339
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:57,459
now a look at the network this is our

340
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,469
good friend connecting to public Wi-Fi

341
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,540
you end up exposing credentials to all

342
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:07,730
the devices you connect to not just

343
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,949
yourself when you do this 80% over 80%

344
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,620
of employees use public Wi-Fi for work

345
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:18,170
tasks even when they're explicitly told

346
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:20,330
not to even when it's banned it's even

347
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,800
easier when you think about mobile like

348
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,090
you just open up your phone you see all

349
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,000
these Wi-Fi networks I'll just choose

350
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,160
one it doesn't really matter

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,770
70% of Wi-Fi set sessions were over an

352
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,680
unencrypted connection we can't force

353
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,780
people to respect mobile we can't just

354
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,959
tell them don't do that and they won't

355
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,959
do that

356
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:47,709
which one is legitimate here it's

357
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:48,660
definitely the bottom one right but at

358
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,920
the same time

359
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,019
McDonald's free Wi-Fi at the top I don't

360
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,529
know if I'd question that if I was near

361
00:16:53,019 --> 00:17:01,930
McDonald's or like which Starbucks Wi-Fi

362
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:03,160
do you choose why - by or Wi-Fi JetBlue

363
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:07,119
they're not flat

364
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,470
JetBlue fly 5 they're just fly by and

365
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,329
it's not like they keep it

366
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,890
except for Starbucks Starbucks actually

367
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,389
does a pretty good job keeping it front

368
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,079
and center for people who come in but

369
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:18,189
like fly fi you get on the plane and you

370
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:25,059
just try to connect to the one that

371
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:26,740
seems the most like JetBlue so that's

372
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,629
just a brief overview of mobile threats

373
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,039
there are obviously a lot more but these

374
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,620
are some that are just like really

375
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:37,320
accessible and so the point where it's

376
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:41,610
like it's insane like with the take the

377
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,570
Google zero-day like that would not have

378
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,000
mobile device management wouldn't have

379
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,559
prevented that and that was two years

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,559
it's offering for two years

381
00:17:50,540 --> 00:18:04,940
so do you bring your own device to work

382
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:07,220
why convenience is mobile lucrative what

383
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,040
makes mobile a good target so the first

384
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,320
is local data stealing corporate data or

385
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,230
any sensitive data we've talked about is

386
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,179
very helpful and then you get to the

387
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,480
other side of things which is the entry

388
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,250
point it's basically the every mobile

389
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,810
device that these people have is

390
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,790
basically the server that's somewhere

391
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,230
that no one knows about that leaves an

392
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,480
entry pointed into the system and gets

393
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:33,140
it

394
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,120
and this leads us back to the 57% of

395
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,780
Android users that are two versions

396
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,520
behind so let's start with sensitive

397
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,570
data

398
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,030
what sensitive data is on your device

399
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,439
your usernames your passwords your

400
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:50,510
credit card info your corporate data

401
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:54,560
pictures of your cat if they own your

402
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:57,370
phone they own you something that we

403
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,860
really like is two-factor authentication

404
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,899
but say they get credentials for your

405
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,760
corporate email and they log in from

406
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,200
their device you've got two factor

407
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,900
authentication no problem you'll get a

408
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,260
text message but if they own your iPhone

409
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,820
or any mobile device you have then

410
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,660
they're the ones getting that text

411
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:20,210
message they can delete it they can use

412
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,400
it to sign in to your an account it's

413
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:27,020
just a step that makes their attack that

414
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,660
much easier and let's talk about the

415
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,730
entry point which is a more high level

416
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:37,970
scenario for an endpoint protection

417
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:39,020
platform when you are a security analyst

418
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,150
you get an alert

419
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,940
it's something's made of pass prevention

420
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,360
you need to check it out you find the

421
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,220
target

422
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,550
you start investigating looks like they

423
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,080
were trying to exfiltrate data you find

424
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,240
them our has done some lateral I mean on

425
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,080
the network they're communicating with a

426
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,210
c2 but you can't find the root cause

427
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,240
there's a black hole of blind spots

428
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,970
they're basically invisible to security

429
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,299
teams that don't

430
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:09,900
have mobile threat detection turns out

431
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:12,000
it's Joe's iPhone damn it Joe Joe hasn't

432
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,289
updated his phone in two years he opened

433
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,090
a text earlier that said I'm doing

434
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:18,000
malicious webpage and gain grood access

435
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,610
on this phone as an endpoint security

436
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,520
vendor you don't know what Joe's phone

437
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,168
is doing you know you don't have to wait

438
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,629
to talk to people about what Joe is

439
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:30,450
doing you don't have a way to detect

440
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,900
before it makes it further on your

441
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:36,750
network it's a problem it's the black

442
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,789
hole of blind spots it's a huge blind

443
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,890
spot for enterprises that don't have

444
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:44,549
mobile to threat detection you can't

445
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:46,650
respond to what you can't attack anyone

446
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:49,460
have any examples of other avenues of

447
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,980
attack that combining mobile with

448
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:57,780
enterprises and with corporate

449
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:02,820
information would look like I'll give a

450
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:05,668
more high-level example your everyday

451
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,200
phishing email you get an email your the

452
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:09,330
in the finance department and you get

453
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,049
this email from the CEO they need funds

454
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:14,879
transferred now most people I think are

455
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,610
getting better with this and they would

456
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,799
take a moment to say I gotta go talk to

457
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,360
the CEO and see if this is legit before

458
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,929
they just send the money but some people

459
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,649
still through it but what about when two

460
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:32,850
minutes later you get a text message

461
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:34,530
that says it's from the CEO asking you

462
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,668
where are those funds transferred why

463
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:39,418
are they transferred yet it's a

464
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:42,659
completely different medium that just

465
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:45,059
confirms and legitimizes what that email

466
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:47,340
was trying to say and all they need to

467
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:52,309
do is gain access to your mobile device

468
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:56,658
and then set up a fake John Smith CEO

469
00:21:52,309 --> 00:22:00,809
and then if you still aren't sure they

470
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:03,510
can do a follow up call take it a step

471
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:05,960
further be really pushy start yelling at

472
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,039
you on the phone using decoy software

473
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,730
there's no way you're not sending them

474
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,730
money after that

475
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,789
so we understand the problem now how can

476
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:20,610
we address it in endpoint security

477
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:22,559
versus education continue to educate

478
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,620
with an application security educate

479
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:29,070
users educate developers be nice to

480
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,449
people when you educate them this is

481
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,519
similar to what tanya was saying in her

482
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,740
keynote everyone needs to be an advocate

483
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:38,929
for mobile security everyone needs to

484
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,799
teach people to respect mobile

485
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:43,320
enterprises need to take mobile

486
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,509
seriously that a lot of people say oh

487
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,499
yes we take mobile very seriously but

488
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:47,789
when you get down to the actual

489
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,440
implementation they're not doing

490
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:56,100
anything or what they're doing is not

491
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:57,960
nearly enough by this year mobile

492
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,709
malware is this was supposed to account

493
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,190
for a third of total malware we need to

494
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:10,080
address it now don't reinvent the

495
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:12,119
pyramid don't just because mobile seems

496
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,090
foreign and point security people need

497
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,789
to not treat it as something completely

498
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:20,309
different but see how they can adapt

499
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:22,408
their system to address it it doesn't

500
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:23,730
need to be a completely new completely

501
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:25,440
different thing that they don't consider

502
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,480
they still need to educate themselves on

503
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,519
it but it's not a completely foreign

504
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:34,830
entity and then leverage the familiar in

505
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,269
the endpoint security space mitre attack

506
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:40,289
is a big thing they actually already

507
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:43,740
have a mitre attack for mobile working

508
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:45,629
with IT for MBMS for example that's a

509
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,789
great example of how working with IT is

510
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:52,049
really important to build a more

511
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:54,269
comprehensive mobile defense and then

512
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:56,009
always remember that convenience is king

513
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,720
we have to make it easy on the

514
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:59,850
developers the end users and the

515
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,549
security people productive communication

516
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,889
is critical so developers need to make

517
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,850
it easy for security people security

518
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:08,699
people need to make it easy for

519
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,080
developers developers and security

520
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,470
people need to make it easy for

521
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,658
end-users and other security people the

522
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:20,730
ones an endpoint security need to make

523
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:23,740
it easy for everyone unless you want

524
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:27,080
another console to monitor

525
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,700
so the importance is to take an endpoint

526
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,649
agnostic approach we want to see the

527
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,650
entire scope of the attack from start to

528
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,450
finish including any mobile aspects we

529
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,980
don't want analysts to have to worry

530
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,110
about something separate when they're

531
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,299
trying to identify mobile it needs to be

532
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,850
in the same platform the entire scope

533
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:46,309
you need to integrate with MDM s you

534
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,830
need to address these issues with an

535
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:53,750
actual endpoint protection platform

536
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:56,539
because Mobile is an endpoint what

537
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,090
happens in 2025 what's next what can we

538
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:59,480
use mobile as a blueprint for in the

539
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,709
future

540
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,000
the obvious one is IOT but what do you

541
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:09,350
guys think is next what do you think is

542
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:14,140
going to be most important 2025 2050 to

543
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:14,139
protect how is this changing

544
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,500
thank you

545
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:29,430
