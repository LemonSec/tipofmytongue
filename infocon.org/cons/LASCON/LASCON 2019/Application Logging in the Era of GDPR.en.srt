thank you for coming

3
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,580
let's just wait one minute for these

4
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,269
gentlemen to sit down yes so we're going

5
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,239
to talk about application logging and

6
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,629
the gdpr

7
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:56,370
before we start let me read my

8
00:00:51,629 --> 00:01:00,180
disclaimer I'm not a lawyer as yeah I'm

practice what we do in our company and

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,680
for secure logging and while in

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,429
compliance with gdpr you should consult

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:27,630
your lawyers for legal advice so that's

15
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:33,869
my disclaimer so yeah so you already

16
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:38,130
heard I must security architect I work

17
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:44,160
on the security and the privacy related

18
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:48,509
topics for the past 15 years currently I

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:52,890
work for Tallis and as quite a few of

20
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,740
you attended last camp before new knows

21
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,729
I'm work for tomahto tomahto has

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:03,300
recently been acquired by Tallis so

23
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,509
Jamaat osteo as a whole as a bubble in

24
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:10,400
palace and I will now call the Tallis D

25
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:13,800
is digital identity and the security and

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,349
the business unit huh

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,500
I'm working on is called cloud

28
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,690
protection so I'm the leader of the

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:29,010
software security for the cloud

30
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:31,829
protection they part so while I was I've

31
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,640
been quite a busy and traveling and I

32
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:39,870
was a lot of work to do so I was

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,570
preparing my presentation on the flight

34
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,830
last Friday as why I was flying back to

35
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,040
Austin

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,290
and the lady sitting next to me she's

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,730
been chatting with me and that she works

38
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,820
in the Environmental Protection and she

39
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,640
just attended a big conference and she's

40
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,640
in the same flight and then I started to

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,730
prepare this presentation she glanced

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,630
over she said oh you again going to give

43
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,780
a talk about logging Wow

44
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:18,030
so logging are you working for a logging

45
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,470
company and because this is it's because

46
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,330
she works on the Environmental

47
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,450
Protection the word and logging just

48
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,300
very in triggering and I said no no I'm

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:31,470
not cutting words I'm working on this

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,630
kind of logging so and then I came back

51
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,640
home and yeah because I heard about

52
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,850
logging I want to really see what is

53
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,040
this why obvious why we call it logging

54
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,920
in the first place right and then your

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,929
search and then addiction or a logging

56
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:52,350
log basically have two main meanings the

57
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,840
first the meaning is basically recording

58
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,150
like they use in early days in

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,000
navigation on ships and the day they do

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,959
logging so your the dictionary say you

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,410
log into you'll you'll log into logs

62
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,690
right and the day they so that that's

63
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,180
one hard and then it's the cutting tree

64
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,180
part but when we're talking about this

65
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,510
so we are dealing with a lot of logs

66
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,730
right and that we have application

67
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:28,020
servers we have applications we have

68
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:30,229
firewalls and we have many kind of

69
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,109
appliances and the services products

70
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:36,780
everybody I mean all peeps all keeps

71
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,800
logs and there are different types of

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,950
logs

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,000
we have audit logs it's basically saying

74
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:48,330
who has done what when and where and we

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,810
have air locks which locks all the

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:55,050
arrows warnings and the events we have

77
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,230
security locks that record security

78
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,740
related event

79
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:03,370
and for example login logout and

80
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:06,610
authorize the access and we also have

81
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:14,020
like you may use multi security it also

82
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:17,410
recalls variety of events so among many

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:22,750
purposes of logging lock data are

84
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:25,980
invaluable for security for detection

85
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,020
incident detect the incidents and

86
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:35,430
monitoring for example monitored the

87
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:40,000
policy violations and for diagnosis and

88
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:44,410
provide evidence for forensics establish

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,360
audit trails and so on so forth and so

90
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:52,780
many of these logs may contain personal

91
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,660
data and that's what we are concerned

92
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,940
about her ok because of the importance

93
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,340
of logs

94
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:05,620
whassa actually have many tools all

95
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,919
guidance for example the top 10

96
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:13,510
proactive controls one of them is about

97
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,850
secure logging and we also know SBS the

98
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,730
application secured a verification

99
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:22,720
standard they also have a section on

100
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:27,310
logging and we have secure logging

101
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,370
project we have they always vlogging

102
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:35,550
cheat sheet we have many references and

103
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:38,410
also other or wasp documents for example

104
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:43,150
developer guide a testing guide also

105
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:45,790
have sections about logging and of

106
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:49,060
course there are open source tools and

107
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:52,030
commercial tools to manage logs so we

108
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,030
already have all these that why are we

109
00:06:52,030 --> 00:07:00,159
still talking about logging why I'm even

110
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:06,900
here right you know probably will ask so

111
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:09,820
on one hand various businesses they have

112
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,219
different set of security

113
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,219
requirements for example if you're

114
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:19,960
dealing banking or you are selling

115
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:23,290
flowers or you're a social social social

116
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:27,549
media provider different a business have

117
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:32,260
their face different risks and they have

118
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:34,210
the different level they have to provide

119
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:39,510
a different may provide a different

120
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,510
level of trust in their applications so

121
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:47,980
we need our developers in Telus we

122
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:51,250
developers often need more relevant

123
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:55,710
security guidance that's one aspect of

124
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:58,320
it and the other aspect is they have you

125
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,780
heard of gdpr

126
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,719
for those you don't know gdpr raise your

127
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:08,950
hand never heard of it

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,860
okay so most people have heard about

129
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:15,760
that gdpr and that there are some people

130
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:20,010
who have not heard about it so this is

131
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:25,240
europeans general data protection

132
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:30,460
regulation so it has become law since

133
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:38,080
last year may 25th 2018 so it has great

134
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:41,079
impact to a lot of companies so then the

135
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,630
developers have many questions what do

136
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,670
we have to do to be G Bhatia should be

137
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:52,060
to be a GDP are combined so this

138
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:57,160
regulation affects all products and

139
00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:02,949
services sold and the used or operated

140
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:06,660
in EU your European Union even if your

141
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,190
services is not actually operating in

142
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,790
European Union you're operating in US

143
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:18,040
but you have users in European Union you

144
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:23,750
have to follow the law so yes because of

145
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:26,180
this need and we have done for myself

146
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,870
and also my colleagues we have done a

147
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:33,739
lot of many work in this area to provide

148
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,350
security and guidance for secure logging

149
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:44,060
and in this talk I would like to share

150
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:47,029
some of our best practices so I assume

151
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,628
most of you know about logging I'm not

152
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:54,519
going to talk into logging when more

153
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:58,040
interested here is securely logging is

154
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:01,069
so we can see we have three bubbles here

155
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,069
and we have overlap between logging and

156
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:07,250
the security not all logging is for

157
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:08,990
security purpose but some of logging is

158
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:15,139
security logging is for security

159
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:17,870
purposes it's about what log for the for

160
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:21,529
security for forensics for audit

161
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,930
purposes and then there's we have

162
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:27,230
security logging I just mentioned we

163
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:30,170
also have security of the logging so

164
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,350
regardless your logging is for security

165
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:38,229
purpose of for other purpose you have

166
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:43,220
you want to make make sure your logging

167
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:45,949
practice and your logs are secure so you

168
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,069
want to protect your logs screams dreams

169
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:52,660
that's what we call security of the

170
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:57,759
logging so regardless what you log and

171
00:10:52,660 --> 00:11:00,620
and with logging and the security the

172
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:05,149
security logging or not security logging

173
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:13,430
they both you both for both you need to

174
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:15,980
concern about data privacy so you know I

175
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:19,370
think many of you have children right

176
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,430
and so a young boy the first day at

177
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,410
school this happens very often

178
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,378
right the first day of the school the

179
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,689
teacher asked the children coming to the

180
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:33,980
front write down your name what do you

181
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:36,770
like and but this little boy is more

182
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,440
security conscious and he said

183
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,020
I write my name on the board I need to

184
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,890
know how you are planning to use that

185
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,110
data so the boy asked the right question

186
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,300
right why do you want me to write down

187
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,000
my name what's the purpose right the

188
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,859
teacher can say well so everybody know

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,410
your name and that they can match the

190
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,740
name with your face right the teacher to

191
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:05,719
have a purpose so collecting personal

192
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:10,910
data must have a legitimate purpose

193
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:14,480
so yesterday I was in the threat

194
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:19,640
modeling workshop and whenever gentleman

195
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:23,390
also said here in this talk and so the

196
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:26,750
first part of this workshop is basically

197
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:29,390
imagine a product that you want to

198
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,310
thread modeling right and so the

199
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,560
instructor was saying you know what you

200
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,510
want you what you want to do and then

201
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,729
people saying smartscooter

202
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:43,100
so they said okay at the end they will

203
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:45,230
build a smart scooter and so and then

204
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,600
the next question is what working lift

205
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,910
whatwhat does the smart scooter do right

206
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,649
beside that a person can ride on a

207
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:58,670
scooter going around Austin right so one

208
00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:02,149
person said well we can collect a lot of

209
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:05,300
data about the rider right and I said

210
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,459
why and I said well we can collect a lot

211
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,920
of data you know just think about it or

212
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:13,520
personally write on the scooter and that

213
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,649
you can collect the heart rate right

214
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,640
it's a smart scooter you can have sensor

215
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:21,950
you can heart rate you can collect a

216
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,589
fingerprint or palm printer you can also

217
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,750
have a little camera to to click the

218
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:29,410
face picture and you can collect

219
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:33,110
locations so you can collect a lot of

220
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:36,770
data about this person but what you

221
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:39,079
really need to ask her is why why do you

222
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,810
what's the purpose of collecting this

223
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:44,300
theta right so I said why right the

224
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,000
prison said well we can click this data

225
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,170
for future use right for the lot of

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,220
companies collecting this state

227
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,229
and another person said oh we can log

228
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,829
everything right we love and then it's

229
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:07,769
again the question I have is why right

230
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:11,069
so oh so they the question is can you or

231
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:18,600
should you collect the personal data

232
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:22,259
just because of you can so what is your

233
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,679
purpose and what is what are the risks

234
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:28,649
of collecting this data what might be

235
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,279
the cost of collecting these data so you

236
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:34,019
need to think through instead of

237
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,980
collecting as much data as you want and

238
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:41,939
love as much data as you want right so

239
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:46,739
now let's we get back to the data

240
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:50,069
privacy law and many countries have data

241
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:59,759
privacy laws so what is the best-known

242
00:14:50,069 --> 00:15:02,998
privacy law in u.s. so every time you go

243
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:07,799
to a every time you go to a doctor's

244
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:09,959
office what do you have to sign yeah so

245
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:14,459
that's the Health Insurance Portability

246
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:18,660
and Accountability Act paper and when I

247
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:21,419
had earlier in earlier years right and

248
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,549
they assistant it will give you a stack

249
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:26,639
of paper and have you read it and a sign

250
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:28,439
at the back now recently I think in

251
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,410
recent years you go there and then they

252
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:35,129
let you sign a sheet of paper and then

253
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,439
saying I have read HIPPA and once I

254
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:39,839
asked them well you never show that to

255
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:44,879
me why do you want me to sign it right

256
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:47,759
so that's a yeah so many countries have

257
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:51,779
a regulations of law and all laws that

258
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:57,539
you provide protected persons people's

259
00:15:51,779 --> 00:16:02,910
privacy so these laws protect personal

260
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:06,449
data stored on computers or in organized

261
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:11,060
the paper filing system so they both

262
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:15,810
electronic or physical record these laws

263
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:19,199
define rules what you have to do in what

264
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:21,719
condition you can collect the data and

265
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,240
that define the rules the people the

266
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,540
employee and organizations have to

267
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,330
follow and also these rules are

268
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:34,819
typically enforced by a government

269
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:40,400
agency so all these data privacy laws

270
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:43,440
they do not prevent organizations from

271
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:49,199
collecting storing or using personal

272
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:51,480
data as long as you follow the rules so

273
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,170
these laws are rules you can still use

274
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,620
but you have to follow the rules okay so

275
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:01,140
now let's get back her sure the European

276
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:08,099
Union's general data protection

277
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:12,150
regulation we typically say gdpr so it's

278
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:18,060
a law they've enabled since last year

279
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:23,640
may 25th 2018 so there is a some there

280
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:25,230
central's well there's a central what

281
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,350
you call and there's a regulation

282
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,860
agencies in each of the European Union's

283
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:35,879
data which can monitor the

284
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:38,370
implementation of these laws so in

285
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,550
recent years that I mean since last year

286
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,969
there been many fines like for Facebook

287
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:49,409
or Google that's a large amount so the

288
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:52,650
fines can go up to four percent of your

289
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:56,190
company's revenue so it's not the profit

290
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:59,450
four percent of the revenue or twenty

291
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:05,300
million euros whichever is higher

292
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:09,110
okay so this is the most stringent

293
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:14,010
privacy laws among over a hundred

294
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:16,770
privacy laws around the world so in this

295
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:20,220
talk we're not going to go into

296
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,500
it feels about this or in its its many

297
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,180
many articles I think it's 99 articles

298
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:30,270
and also a non-expert of GDP are however

299
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:33,710
we're going to highlight some points

300
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:36,000
that we believe that's relevant to

301
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:39,270
application logging that's the topic

302
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,720
we'll talk about and that at the start

303
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:46,860
of this regulation in there at the very

304
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,560
beginning in the recital and this GDP

305
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,860
are I'm going to read this this is exact

306
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,030
culture the protection of natural

307
00:18:52,860 --> 00:19:01,320
persons in relation to the processing of

308
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:04,770
personal data is a fundamental right so

309
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,230
this is their belief protection of

310
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:11,520
personal data is a fundamental right

311
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:16,170
like speech like just living okay so it

312
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,830
is very important now what happens in

313
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,540
the data

314
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:25,230
what considered as personal data it's

315
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:32,790
any information relating to a natural

316
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:36,770
person directly or indirectly as you can

317
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:39,780
see it's go beyond the traditional

318
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,410
definition of personal data so it does

319
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:47,910
include the traditional ones like names

320
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:51,180
phone numbers locations IP numbers so

321
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,570
those we typically consider as personal

322
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,660
data

323
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:59,570
it also consider other information like

324
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:03,200
racial or ethnic origin the health data

325
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:08,939
your political opinions your

326
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:13,080
philosophical openings your religious

327
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,760
your religion your trade union

328
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:20,490
membership so these are all concerned as

329
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,710
personal data and you can see I have

330
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:27,690
some reference so I'll say GDP our

331
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:30,270
article 4.1 and I'm not in the in this

332
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,630
talk I'm not directly quote

333
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:36,270
use layman's language trying to explain

334
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,280
some of the concept if you want to see

335
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:41,850
details and because it's a long

336
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:46,340
regulation I point to the article number

337
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,340
so you can go to look by yourself

338
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:55,020
another concept I want to point out is

339
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:59,360
called a data controller and the data

340
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:04,250
processor so the data controller

341
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:07,949
determines the purpose and the means of

342
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:12,179
processing of personal data in terms of

343
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:15,440
collect transmit stall process use order

344
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:20,059
he set her so the data controller

345
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:24,690
determines why and the how

346
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:28,340
okay and then there's another entity is

347
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:32,700
called data processor the data processes

348
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:37,139
process the personal data on behalf of

349
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,690
the data controller so as a company you

350
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,360
want to ask yourself well our weight

351
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:47,070
data controller or where data processor

352
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,840
and in the regulation it has rules for

353
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:54,290
the data controller and the full

354
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:56,809
processor okay so as an example as

355
00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:00,389
gemalto I still like to say gemalto

356
00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:06,540
hoteles D is now our name is Tallis D is

357
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:10,620
as a company in town in general we are

358
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:13,020
data processor our customers as you know

359
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:19,250
Jim Otto's customer is basically the

360
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:23,270
government banks telecom operators

361
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:27,120
enterprise and yeah companies basically

362
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:29,970
organizations so those our customers

363
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:34,350
they are data controllers we are data

364
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:38,370
processors we process data on their

365
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:42,600
behalf for example the business unit I'm

366
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,929
working in is for cloud protection so we

367
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,280
provide

368
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:51,430
and their services to protect identities

369
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,950
and to protect data so we're doing this

370
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:59,260
on the behalf of our customers where

371
00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:01,090
there are processors okay however from

372
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:05,080
the logging perspective

373
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:08,199
we're also data controllers because in

374
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:12,300
order to provide for example data

375
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:16,150
protection service we need to do certain

376
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:18,430
types of logging to provide the service

377
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,920
to provide a support to provide

378
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:24,640
maintenance importantly to provide

379
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:27,580
security so from that aspect we are data

380
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,580
controllers because in order to provide

381
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:34,090
a service we need you to log in we need

382
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:37,750
to log certain data and we have the

383
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:44,649
control to decide what to long what not

384
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:48,370
long okay and so GDP are also talked

385
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:52,600
about listed some data protection

386
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:59,500
principles so we're going to go through

387
00:23:52,600 --> 00:24:06,159
the main ones so personal data shall be

388
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:10,900
must be processed lawfully fairly in the

389
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:14,980
in transparent manner so I think this is

390
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:19,300
clear so these points almost all of them

391
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:22,680
related to logging logging if you log

392
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,850
personal data it's still considered as

393
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,430
processing of personal data

394
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,449
the act of logging is considered

395
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:33,450
processing so the basic principle

396
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,450
applies

397
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:44,290
the personal data shall be collected for

398
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:52,960
specified explicit and that legitimate

399
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:57,040
purpose in the DS data collected had to

400
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:00,610
be adequate relevant and the limited you

401
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,600
really want to minimize the personal

402
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:06,149
data you collect you know you want to

403
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:12,639
this is called the data minimization

404
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:15,330
okay we'll see why later and that the

405
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:21,190
data collected that must be I create a

406
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:24,370
curator and I required help to up to

407
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:28,210
data so your I CI grade out part of it

408
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:32,350
because okay I create whatever we we log

409
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:35,290
it has to be accurate right and if you

410
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:38,379
not logging if your application need to

411
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:41,470
store personal data say store in your

412
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:45,460
database and that this data has to be

413
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:47,890
accurate and have to kept up to data

414
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,470
right because we're going to talk about

415
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:54,220
it's about the right of the individual

416
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:59,050
and if the individual say okay this has

417
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:02,500
change that they want to change and for

418
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:04,750
example they they have a new baby right

419
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,810
and from the health care perspective as

420
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:10,900
before you can't they they the lady

421
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:12,639
covers herself and her husband now have

422
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,210
a new baby now they will cover another

423
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,880
baby so the family situation has changed

424
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:22,630
the you want to it keep up to date but

425
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,850
with logging this keep up to date does

426
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,090
not apply because you don't suppose to

427
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:32,590
change the log we need to keep the

428
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:35,530
integrity of the log and retained the

429
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:38,740
personal data shall be retained as long

430
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:41,500
as necessary only as long as necessary

431
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:45,750
if you no longer need the data the

432
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,750
personal data has to be removed

433
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,010
and then importantly process the

434
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,439
personal data shall be processed in the

435
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:57,560
appropriate manner to maintain the

436
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,710
security so this is saying we have to

437
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:10,669
protect the personal data you store or

438
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:16,360
your record on your logs so in certain

439
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:23,990
situations you will have to get consent

440
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:26,780
for collecting personal data ok in so

441
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:32,500
they have specific articles to talk

442
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:37,700
about this to talk about consent and so

443
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:41,000
for us most of the time because we're

444
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,220
data person processor the consent has

445
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,340
been already been done by the data

446
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:50,140
controller so mostly the consent is done

447
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:53,449
by the data controller we don't need to

448
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,880
have all additional consent except in

449
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:58,970
certain situations which I'm going to

450
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:02,270
talk about so it's called special

451
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:06,260
categories of personal data and that so

452
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:11,510
this consent is managed by the data

453
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:15,110
controller ok if yeah I'm going to

454
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:18,230
mention that a little bit later so the

455
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:24,050
rights of in in the video is this the

456
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:26,000
subject can request to access the data

457
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:29,720
you collected for example in HIPAA

458
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,560
situation it's very similar in this case

459
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,270
to HIPAA and if you read the HIPAA you

460
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,000
actually you can ask your health

461
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:43,300
provider to see what they have recorded

462
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,540
ok and the right to rectification

463
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:49,790
basically correction and that this the

464
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:53,659
next one is a right to be forgotten so

465
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:57,950
this is pretty new compared to the

466
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:59,240
previous and other privacy laws so if

467
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,659
you remember

468
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,899
of even few years back you create

469
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:08,899
account online you will never be able to

470
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:13,699
remove that account right and you can

471
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:17,000
sign in but you cannot forever sign out

472
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:22,399
right so this now with this law the

473
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,399
right we forgotten is enforced that the

474
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,779
for example the service provider they

475
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:32,059
have to be able to allow you to

476
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:34,909
disassociate yourself with the online

477
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:38,840
service you sign before in the right

478
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:42,590
reportability is your data you should be

479
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,370
able to export your data and move it to

480
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:49,120
another provider for example you use one

481
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:53,000
storage service and you want to be able

482
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,350
let's see you you want to be able to

483
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,460
take your data out and put into another

484
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:06,049
another service and write who object is

485
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:07,970
if they if the if the personal data is

486
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:12,320
collected for certain purpose for

487
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:15,649
example marketing and all for some other

488
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,010
campaigns and that first of all in this

489
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:23,479
situation you have to get individuals

490
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:26,059
consent and that the individuals the

491
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,380
person should have to have they the

492
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:35,990
right and the means to reject not do not

493
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:39,789
allow to connect ok so now in terms of

494
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:43,669
logs our developers ask many questions

495
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:47,690
and these are the most frequent

496
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:51,049
questions and what personal data should

497
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:54,200
not be logged ok because we all know GTB

498
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:56,990
our GD GD P R is in force that we went

499
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,270
through a big exercise to go through all

500
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:03,679
the applications that who make sure were

501
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,190
gdb are combined and now the in terms of

502
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,520
logging

503
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:10,909
what personal data should not be logged

504
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:12,559
and what personal data we can log so

505
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:18,230
these are the most frequent

506
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:22,039
they ask the questions so to answer that

507
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:25,909
question you have to ask yourself what

508
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:29,769
is the purpose that we collected we

509
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:33,759
collect the personal data okay so we

510
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:38,600
normally call it a justification of need

511
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:40,580
so basically that the data your log data

512
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,070
either we are talking about here the

513
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,918
data collected should be necessary to

514
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:50,240
accomplish the purpose for which logged

515
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,460
it has a generated for example you

516
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:58,309
generate you have to collect certain

517
00:31:52,460 --> 00:32:00,710
data to provide service okay to provide

518
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:05,809
a support of your service or maintenance

519
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:15,080
or the security so these are all

520
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:18,678
legitimate need in one of the they one

521
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:27,320
of the article article 6 and talked

522
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:29,379
about the processing let's see so talked

523
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,350
about the article 6 talked about

524
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:35,899
processing is is lawful only if then

525
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:40,119
there's a couple of conditions right and

526
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:43,100
one of the condition is basically saying

527
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:48,399
processing of personal data in our case

528
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:51,490
is logging is lawful if it is necessary

529
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:55,939
it is necessary for the purpose of

530
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:59,929
legitimate interest of the data

531
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:02,659
controller and then they further in one

532
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:05,360
they call it recital 49 let's so from

533
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:06,110
the security point of view that you can

534
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,928
take a look

535
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:12,610
it says processing of personal data to

536
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:15,080
the extent strictly necessary and

537
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:17,869
proportionate for the purpose of

538
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:21,019
ensuring network and the information

539
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:24,678
security so this is considered as a

540
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:27,240
legitimate purpose so given this it's

541
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,970
basically saying we can't

542
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,490
we can lock certain personal data as

543
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,730
long as it's for the legitimate purpose

544
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:39,030
of the data controller in our case it is

545
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:41,270
especially for the purpose to ensure

546
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:45,780
network and the information security

547
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:48,510
okay and we also as we talked earlier we

548
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:54,149
want to minimize the personal data that

549
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:58,980
we need you we we collect in so what

550
00:33:54,150 --> 00:34:02,100
should not be longer basically you do

551
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:06,000
not do not log sensitive personal data

552
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:10,949
from the GDP our perspective it has a

553
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:14,250
special category of personal data so the

554
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:19,439
special character categories include the

555
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:22,020
list above except the last two okay

556
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,630
last two is a Social Security is mainly

557
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:30,570
for for us for some other countries

558
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:33,480
social security number is not a private

559
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:36,210
data is in public right for some

560
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,969
European country and the copy of the ID

561
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:42,510
document so let's look at a special

562
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:47,509
category and it's yeah we mentioned

563
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:50,510
before racial or ethnic origin political

564
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:53,360
companies or trade union membership

565
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:56,840
religious or philosophical believes

566
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:00,270
information about health or sex life

567
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:04,680
information related to crime or alleged

568
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:08,520
crime genetic data biometric data these

569
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:12,060
are special categories personal data and

570
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:16,890
you should not lock them and if you must

571
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:20,279
if you if you want to lock them you must

572
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:23,819
have very good reasons to include such

573
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,700
data as we mentioned and that so in the

574
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,370
regulation it's basically saying

575
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:32,759
processing of these data are prohibited

576
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:35,850
unless they're certain conditions apply

577
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:40,110
and also certain conditions for example

578
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:42,779
is for Public Safety also for save lives

579
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:46,140
and that's the and some other conditions

580
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:50,520
in general you should avoid logging any

581
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:53,250
of these data and in addition if you

582
00:35:50,520 --> 00:36:00,030
have to log and you will need explicit

583
00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:03,690
consent what can be loud so logs may

584
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,970
include the personal data except the

585
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:08,970
sensitive data we listed in the previous

586
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:11,250
slide as long as the need that can be

587
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,950
justified okay

588
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,790
for example they the data we collect

589
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:21,600
this data it's necessary to accomplish

590
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:26,009
the purpose for which the log are

591
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:29,220
generate data by my application is for

592
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:32,340
its operation in order to provide this

593
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:36,810
service I have to log let's see the user

594
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:38,880
ID I have to long certain data and other

595
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:42,120
and though I may have to log the IP

596
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,710
address so I my response to go back to

597
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:50,910
where it came from

598
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:54,900
right and so just be careful and that

599
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:58,109
you want to make sure you can justify

600
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:02,580
the need that's what that that's the

601
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:05,970
important part and that they the long

602
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:08,520
personal data could trigger the rights

603
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,680
of the individuals what depend on the

604
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,430
what you're logging and if or not you

605
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,460
can justify how you justify the need

606
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:20,430
plus if we log personal data we have to

607
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:25,100
be compliant with the data protection

608
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:30,990
principles which we also talked before

609
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:33,509
so in general we want you basically do

610
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:37,350
not allow the personal data unless it is

611
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:41,670
necessary and if you do log be combined

612
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:44,670
with the data protection principles

613
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:47,730
so it's regardless what personal data

614
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:51,630
you log you want the the personal data

615
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:54,000
have to be protected and as we know

616
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:57,650
improper protection will get

617
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,690
will leak the data and it can have many

618
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:03,560
cause many problems both the personal

619
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,720
problems like identity theft and

620
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:11,040
identity fraud and also and financial

621
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,770
pains and also caused suffering for for

622
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,609
organizations that just think about all

623
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:19,590
the the big breaches so that's the

624
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:23,580
organization themselves or think about

625
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:26,340
effects and just hundreds of millions of

626
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:30,960
users personal information a leak right

627
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:34,320
and that that will has great locks

628
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,930
actually for all the organizations so

629
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,590
it's like you protect your personal data

630
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:43,049
and your database similarly for your

631
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:52,020
locks you if they have personal data you

632
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:54,590
really have to protect them so you in

633
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,359
general you have to protect your logs

634
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:59,900
especially the logs with personal data

635
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,710
you want to protect for its

636
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:06,570
confidentiality right protected from

637
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:11,849
disclosure to unauthorized the person

638
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:14,849
right and protect its integrity its

639
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:18,330
availability and authenticity and that

640
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:24,780
so you really want to protect your logs

641
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:27,180
and so the level of protection how much

642
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:32,070
protection do you need to put onto your

643
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:34,680
logs that could depend what has

644
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:38,099
sensitive what what kind of data you

645
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,830
have in your log and also it could

646
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:45,359
depend on your hosting infrastructure

647
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:49,230
right so it's it's really depend and I'm

648
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:53,220
going to talk about what we do and we

649
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:56,700
tell us the is slash gemalto and that

650
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:59,129
you might do it differently it's really

651
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:03,049
depend on your situation

652
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,050
okay so

653
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:12,370
what we do within palace the eyes in

654
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:15,880
order to build a personal data

655
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:20,950
protection framework and in order to

656
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:23,760
implement privacy by design we classify

657
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:27,730
personal data into different levels

658
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:34,270
based on the impact if this personal

659
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:37,840
data is disclosed so the level high is

660
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:42,100
the confidentiality breach could cause

661
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:45,430
serious harm to individuals so that's

662
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:49,600
for that data will consider high and the

663
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:52,770
we'll have examples later on so it could

664
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:56,500
cause physical social or financial harm

665
00:40:52,770 --> 00:41:02,560
resulting to potential loss of life loss

666
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:05,140
of livelihood and and/or in appropriate

667
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,590
they detention physical personal

668
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:11,109
detention and that medium is the

669
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:14,200
confidential confidentiality breach

670
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:16,570
could cause ma during hard to individual

671
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,839
harm to individuals for example

672
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:22,750
financial loss due to identity theft or

673
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:27,630
deny of benefits and public humiliation

674
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:31,230
and so on so forth and that the low

675
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:34,330
level is the confidentiality breach

676
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:39,430
would not post in the middle harm more

677
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:42,340
than inconvenience for example someone

678
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:45,009
still well for example or that your

679
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,900
email is leaked out and you will need to

680
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:53,410
change a different to a different email

681
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:59,500
address okay so again this is what we do

682
00:41:53,410 --> 00:42:01,690
within Calais D is and that you should

683
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,990
have your own classification like this

684
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:06,760
morning Tania was giving a talk she also

685
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,509
mentioned about the data classification

686
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:14,110
and that as we all know security has a

687
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:17,260
cost you don't have to apply the same

688
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:19,750
level of security to all your data

689
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:23,100
so what you really want to do is to

690
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:26,770
classify your data and apply security

691
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:29,859
protection properly so with log is

692
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:33,070
similar as with your other data that

693
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:38,580
you're holding in your database and here

694
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:42,119
are some examples we have for example

695
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:45,359
for individual IDs like social security

696
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:48,790
number and driver license state ID

697
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:52,230
passport ID and so on so forth these we

698
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:54,910
classified as high and also special

699
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:57,369
categories of data as we mentioned

700
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,089
earlier a high and a financial

701
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,130
information

702
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:02,850
yeah financial information you also have

703
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:07,570
to have PCI compliance and other things

704
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:09,819
so cardholder data is credit card data

705
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:13,450
and a payment history bank account

706
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:15,340
number these are highs and then the

707
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,490
location they'd have for example your

708
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:22,210
physical location your address a GPS

709
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:24,549
location IP address and indirect

710
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:29,859
identifiers like public key like

711
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:32,890
password your cookies your tokens JSON

712
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:36,670
token and the Saudis are classified as

713
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:40,660
medium and then direct identifiers like

714
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:45,040
name email address username for normal

715
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:49,230
normal and user login and public login

716
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:53,920
IDs these are classified it's low again

717
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:57,190
this is how we do it you may do it

718
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,310
differently you may have more levels

719
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:02,619
right you may have you may have a

720
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:06,730
critical and high you may have four

721
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:14,560
levels right so this is a example right

722
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:16,770
so and then so then when you do apply

723
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,690
security you want to protect the data

724
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,300
you want to consider your data

725
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,760
classification you want to consider the

726
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,670
security level of your infrastructure I

727
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:31,270
eat for this the second bullet each

728
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:34,690
companies are different in our case

729
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:37,150
we have applications that deployed into

730
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:40,150
enterprise we also provide cloud

731
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:43,950
services and then you use cloud

732
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:46,480
providers we also have makes the hybrid

733
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:49,569
applications which part of it in our own

734
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,510
data center and part of it in cloud so

735
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:54,880
it's really depend the the

736
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:56,050
infrastructure you have to consider

737
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,420
house

738
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:01,120
what is the security level of your

739
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:04,300
infrastructure so for example we treat

740
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:08,410
our own data center the security level

741
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:10,720
is different from if it's if it's

742
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:12,790
running in the cloud you want to

743
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,950
consider the data in transit and the

744
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:22,300
data at rest okay and another thing we

745
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:26,770
do is before all these gdpr thing and we

746
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:29,710
do have data protection in general so we

747
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:35,980
have general data protection policies

748
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:38,410
and then we classify the data as as

749
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:41,350
there is public data right we're now

750
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:45,970
considering that part we consider the

751
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:51,060
company private and company restricted

752
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:55,060
and the company credential company

753
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,540
secret confidential company confidential

754
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,960
okay

755
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:03,190
let's see we have three levels and then

756
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,310
what we have have classified the

757
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:09,490
personal data and then we map into our

758
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:14,160
original data protection framework for

759
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:16,870
example we have the low will map to our

760
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,529
private company private and the medium

761
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:24,250
would map to restricted the high would

762
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:27,130
map to confidential right and that in

763
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:30,490
this way that your previous data

764
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:34,240
protection framework can still apply to

765
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:36,609
personal data and apply to log so your

766
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,729
log your logs that's another thing we

767
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:43,720
discussed before I mean within our

768
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:46,670
company your logs may contain different

769
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,730
different personal data which may fall

770
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:52,819
into different categories of the

771
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:57,069
classification in this case your log

772
00:46:52,819 --> 00:47:00,529
stream should be protected at highest

773
00:46:57,069 --> 00:47:02,980
level that is highest the data

774
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:05,900
classification level and it should be

775
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,960
protected oh yeah at that level consider

776
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:11,000
the highest one

777
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:15,609
so that again that's what we do and that

778
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:22,480
you can you can design your own

779
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:26,180
protection framework let me talk briefly

780
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,030
production logs you want to store

781
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:32,919
production logs securely that's yeah oh

782
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:35,440
yes they regardless I want to mention

783
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,900
regardless of the personal data

784
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,710
classification level and you do not want

785
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:45,650
to make those data publicly accessible

786
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:49,369
that's even if it's low it should still

787
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:51,890
be protected and you want to protect the

788
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:55,190
logs from unauthorized access

789
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,589
we know that logs may contain personal

790
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:59,690
data it may contain other sensitive data

791
00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:03,290
which may not be personal right maybe

792
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:06,349
the company's secret or contain other

793
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:10,009
things so you want to protect logs from

794
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:11,809
unauthorized access and that more

795
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:13,250
specifically you want to protect a

796
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:16,069
personal data in logs

797
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:19,670
there's many there are different schemes

798
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:22,250
you can do you can anonymize you know so

799
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:25,069
the question is do you really need to

800
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:29,690
know this in the video or you just want

801
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:32,089
to counter as one person right so if the

802
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:35,119
latter case you want to anonymize and

803
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:37,069
all you want to mask that's like we

804
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,349
enter password you have starts last hour

805
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:42,109
right and then you can use whatever mask

806
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:44,510
to mask the personal data you can hash

807
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:47,960
it you can't organize it or you can

808
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:50,920
encrypt so use different ways to protect

809
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,920
your personal data

810
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:59,690
another thing is do not use the bug or

811
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:03,260
trace lock level in production so as we

812
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:06,890
know the log has different lock levels

813
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:10,370
so the debug or trace gives you the

814
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:14,450
maximum information about your

815
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:16,400
application it could log everything in

816
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:19,160
plane the username password and the

817
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,910
headers and everything so in production

818
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:26,420
you should avoid to use the bug in the

819
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:28,940
trace level do not set it as default in

820
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,370
your development environment you may

821
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,920
have debug or trace level said has

822
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:36,140
default because you are developing it

823
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,620
and you want to debug it right and

824
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:41,690
remember to turn it off and to change it

825
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,660
to error or warning change to a

826
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:47,090
different level in certain situations I

827
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:49,910
have developer asked me I in certain

828
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:53,210
situations they let's see a credit card

829
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:55,100
doesn't work and your credit card

830
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:58,400
transaction does now goes through and

831
00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:00,650
then but the application is deployed on

832
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,730
a bank on a customer side it is not on

833
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:08,390
our side and we can't troubleshooting in

834
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:11,990
these certain situations you have to log

835
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:14,690
all the details so and our support team

836
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:17,509
can can be back then we said well to not

837
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:20,150
have debug or trace log in production

838
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:24,020
but in certain situations you will have

839
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:26,540
to to do it in order to foreign 6 or

840
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,800
troubleshooting in that case you can

841
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:32,570
turn on temporarily as soon as useless

842
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,500
you're neither is fulfilled you should

843
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,500
turn it back off

844
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:44,090
protect logs in transit yeah so this I

845
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:46,310
think there's a security conference yeah

846
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:48,950
you secure communication channels for

847
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:51,710
example TLS and make sure you

848
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:54,710
authenticate at the end points when you

849
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:58,310
so typically if you have machine running

850
00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:00,800
in DMZ and all running in less secure

851
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:03,440
environment you have logs you won't

852
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,119
really want to send it off sudra me off

853
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,599
to a more secure

854
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,429
environment but you want to know your

855
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:12,949
end point you know you are sending to

856
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:15,949
the right place and the receiving end

857
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:18,380
you also want to make sure it's the

858
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:22,549
right party you are expecting so that's

859
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:24,979
what we need authentication they the

860
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:28,159
last point I want to make sure is we

861
00:51:24,979 --> 00:51:30,799
define a log retention policy you

862
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:33,949
remember as we said with gdpr you can

863
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:35,689
only keep the data as long as necessary

864
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:38,839
right that's what we relate to a lot

865
00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:43,489
retention policy so personal data in

866
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:46,549
logs may may be retained for the

867
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:48,709
duration of agreement with customer for

868
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:53,089
example the customer has signed up a

869
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:55,368
3-year contract with us and then in

870
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:57,739
interlocks we may have a personal data

871
00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:01,459
of course we have to get that protected

872
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:06,609
and so we can retain it in the duration

873
00:52:01,459 --> 00:52:10,640
of the customer so they now the

874
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:13,189
retention the usefulness of the log data

875
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:18,229
I should use to decide the duration of

876
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:21,078
the retention so you may have some some

877
00:52:18,229 --> 00:52:24,288
regulations and compliance rules that

878
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:27,679
requires you to keep longer longer than

879
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:31,400
the contract with your customer so you

880
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:36,559
do want to explicitly define it for

881
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:40,099
example with PCI DSS compliance there is

882
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:44,539
a certain period you need to keep the

883
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:47,299
logs for audit purposes and so that will

884
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:50,449
help you to define the retention here in

885
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:53,209
a and then eliminate her personal data

886
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:56,029
at the end of the retention period you

887
00:52:53,209 --> 00:52:58,879
don't want to keep the personal data

888
00:52:56,029 --> 00:53:00,469
more than you need right but you keep

889
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,429
the personal data you are bearing the

890
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:07,669
risk of potential violation of the

891
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:12,109
regulations okay

892
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:15,650
so summary do not log personal data

893
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:17,600
unless it is necessary and if you have

894
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:22,820
to log be compliant with

895
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:25,270
gdpr and the protector the data that's

896
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:28,850
all I have I want to give special thanks

897
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:31,460
to mr. jean-pierre Mistral he's our

898
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:34,819
privacy lawyer and he provided a lot of

899
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:37,730
advice for me to prepare this talk and

900
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:40,480
help us to provide a developer

901
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:47,050
guidelines thank you

902
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:47,050
[Applause]

903
