00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,519
all right well welcome everybody it's

3
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,950
it's not fair having a follow Tonya

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,630
theyjust is one thing I'll say it

5
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,580
reminds me of a time earlier in my

6
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,270
career when I was speaking at a I Triple

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,170
E meeting in San Antonio and they and

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,489
they said okay when they're getting

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,830
ready to introduce me and say okay guys

10
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,550
like have we got something great for you

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,320
next month

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,449
right we're moving to a bigger venue

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,140
because we've got brn stru strip the

14
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,759
creator of C++ coming out there's a guy

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,860
and today is Dan Cornell talking about

16
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:09,420
some security stuff so at least in that

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,539
case I got to talk first now I've got to

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,740
be in Tania's at shadow a little bit of

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,759
background on me that's what I look like

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,820
with the actual haircut and a coat and

21
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,710
I'm one of the founders and the CTO of

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,660
dental roof and I guess what's important

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,860
on here is I'm a software developer by

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,810
background um with started with Java in

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,020
the mid-to-late 90s a lot of server-side

26
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,330
Java spent in the early 2000 sometime

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,610
with the earlier net stuff but really

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,350
for the last 15 years I've been focused

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,090
on helping organizations deal with the

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,428
the security the applications they're

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,160
developing and so from a perspective

32
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:48,810
standpoint I come at this from a

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,000
developer's perspective who's come to

34
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,860
security as opposed to someone from a

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,440
more traditional like pentest background

36
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,679
that is now looking at web and mobile

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,050
and cloud native applications so agenda

38
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:02,280
wise we'll talk a little bit the good

39
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,599
old days and then talk about some of the

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,160
interesting things that we've seen in

41
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,420
the ways that organizations are

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,520
developing and deploying software

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,520
specifically cloud native applications

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,980
and the the point of this talk is is

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,530
really just for me to relay things that

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,170
we've seen in how we've had to evolve

47
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,150
our assessment practices to deal with

48
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,059
the way that organizations the way the

49
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,920
organization's developing software has

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,870
evolved and I was joking I was talking

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,149
with a couple of folks yesterday and I

52
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,830
was asked what's the answer and I was

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,870
like well no the talk just lays out the

54
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,390
problem at the end I say like so what so

55
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,030
what are we gonna do folks well what's

56
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,350
what's the answer so I'll talk through a

57
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,880
number of things that we see and also

58
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,880
talk about some of the things that we've

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,890
seen in the communique

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,170
like how you characterize the things

61
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,730
that you find during assessments and

62
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,660
we'll see if we have time for a question

63
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,010
if you have a question along the way

64
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,109
please raise your hand I think we've got

65
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,730
a little bit of a squish schedule but

66
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,320
I'll try to get your answer any

67
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:01,119
questions that people have I I realize

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,950
I've been in this industry possibly too

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,750
long because I've started putting slides

70
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,670
in talks to talk about the good old days

71
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,290
and that may mean that it's that I've

72
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,679
officially become a curmudgeon I don't

73
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,480
know but I'm i hearken back to the good

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,010
old days where you had an application

75
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,019
right it was a web application if you

76
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,790
got users and the bad guys on one side I

77
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,410
got a database on the other side you've

78
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,179
got your application here and for an

79
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,799
assessment right you you know give me a

80
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,290
URL and a couple logins all just like

81
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,910
blast app scan or web inspect edit clear

82
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,250
out the false positives do our manual

83
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,280
pen testing you know based on the wasp

84
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,320
ASVs or whatever other methodology that

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,150
you had you know or if we had the source

86
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,500
code like you know stuff it through

87
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,850
checkmarks or running a fortifier

88
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,320
whatever against it again clear out

89
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,450
false positives and then go through and

90
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,190
do your manual checks accordin whatever

91
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,660
checklist you had and it was you know it

92
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,000
was it was fun work in his exciting work

93
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,460
but it was it was it was comparatively

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,130
very straightforward and when you're

95
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,330
done you just generated a PDF you secure

96
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,790
you emailed it off to somebody and then

97
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,770
you're like on in the next you know on

98
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,390
your next responsibility and I think

99
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,220
there's as I said I'm gonna talk a

100
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,589
little bit about some things some some

101
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,910
things that we've seen in with reporting

102
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,290
I think there's a lot more to be

103
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,630
discussed there we're not gonna have

104
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,049
time to drill into that as much as I

105
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,000
would like to because what I want to

106
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,770
focus on is kind of what we've seen in

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,870
the way that organizations develop

108
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,960
applications and the implications that

109
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,420
has forced us to you have to take as we

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,770
look to start evolving the way that we

111
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,540
look at doing assessments for

112
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,219
applications so we look at the more

113
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,390
interesting new days this is a

114
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,430
architecture diagram they got spit out

115
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,219
by some we've built some technology that

116
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,830
auto draws threat models for you based

117
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,940
on like agents you put on systems which

118
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,010
is something that we're just kind of

119
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,250
playing with in the lab and I installed

120
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,840
this on our thread fix product you know

121
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,240
and looked at

122
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,619
and you know Jojo hey here's all the

123
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,880
your communications that it's got going

124
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,810
to different places and I said you know

125
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,490
looked out and I said oh okay I

126
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,810
understand why it's communicating out to

127
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,949
this server out to this server up to

128
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,169
this server yeah it's collecting data

129
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,910
from those servers that make sense

130
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,169
there's some web connected stuff that we

131
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,490
have the ability to do now and I look

132
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,510
through enough I understand that

133
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,729
connection I understand that connection

134
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,590
why are we talking to these two web

135
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,240
constructs right so I went to the

136
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,239
architect needs like oh we needed to do

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,470
XYZ mobile whatever right and so even

138
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,949
with the product and I'm pretty familiar

139
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,510
with right when we looked into it to see

140
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,710
what all what are all the things that

141
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,440
this thing you're talking to you like

142
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,030
there are areas that I didn't know about

143
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,340
no which I found to be which I found to

144
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,900
be slightly scary but also very

145
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,659
interesting because it echos the things

146
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,979
that we've seen you know looking at the

147
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,260
more modern applications at

148
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:41,880
organizations you have brought to us to

149
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:45,750
do testing on even more interesting new

150
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,889
days was this was a this was an

151
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:52,199
application for a media organization and

152
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,639
they had you know again they had most of

153
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,800
the application was a me and it was an

154
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,870
AWS it had a web front-end it talked

155
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,220
back to a couple of different you know

156
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,950
micro services to do different things

157
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,660
the user service content service

158
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,909
location service also talked out to

159
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,789
various s3 buckets you know that's great

160
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,770
used Amazon Arora for database also had

161
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,360
you know hosted MongoDB would that we

162
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,590
couldn't quite exactly you'll find

163
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,700
immediately aware that was that so

164
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,739
that's you know raised some question

165
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,880
marks and in talking they're talking

166
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,190
through this with them and they're lucky

167
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,139
on the chat has hosted a tracks based on

168
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,060
a dedicated server taking notes for like

169
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,490
write chat hosted on a Rackspace cloud

170
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,520
server and I said no it's on a dedicated

171
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,560
server the dedicated servers like who's

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,260
using dedicated servers these days and

173
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,669
so I envisioned what did what did the

174
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,889
provisioning of this server look like

175
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,510
right was that the reverse of the scene

176
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,820
in Raiders of the Lost Ark right where

177
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,409
somebody writes on a scrap of paper like

178
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,880
need dedicated server eight core by

179
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,229
whatever how many memories you know put

180
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,139
in one of those banker tubes and like

181
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,030
screw the end shut mic then it goes down

182
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,349
like to the sub-basement somebody gets

183
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,599
this like oh you know we need it we need

184
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:56,580
to go get a server okay you'll roll the

185
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,469
card out and you take the dusty Dell box

186
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,940
off of the thing and you know put it on

187
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,780
the cart and like wheel it back to the

188
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,780
order of those

189
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,010
Industrial elevators I don't know what

190
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,530
the scene looks like but that was that

191
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,450
was really interesting to us to see you

192
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,460
know this application again very modern

193
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,169
application where it had web front end

194
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,638
it had micro services it was using

195
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,380
different cloud constructs it was

196
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,090
talking out to a cloud provider that

197
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,730
nobody really knew a lot about you know

198
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,169
and you know it and as always when I

199
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,690
when I want to hear something from a

200
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,549
client like not not all the time but

201
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,110
from time to time I'll have the reaction

202
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,800
of well that's stupid why are they doing

203
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,419
that right and always I'm always wrong

204
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,940
right they always have a reason and it's

205
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,890
always a good reason right and Wendy

206
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,240
Nader has talked about this a lot you

207
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,560
know in some of our blog posts and

208
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,880
things like that where everyone else to

209
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
make fun and you have security maybe

210
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,230
like scoffs that things a little bit too

211
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,580
often because the reason was running a

212
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,230
dedicated server is that was the only

213
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,520
configuration that the vendor would

214
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,810
support they said you know for whatever

215
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,039
reason performance reasons you're

216
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,240
correct or not if you want vendor

217
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,460
support for this it has to go into

218
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,110
dedicated server they wanted this they

219
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,690
wanted the vendor support okay there we

220
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,160
go so that's a that was a mini-lesson

221
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,050
that I got out of this is like every

222
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,370
time my reaction is like wow these folks

223
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,500
are doing something stupid I'm

224
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,690
universally wrong because they always

225
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,479
have a reason and when you look at that

226
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,610
in the context of the requirements being

227
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,680
placed on you know the dev team in the

228
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,590
operations organization like a hundred

229
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,150
percent of the time it's a completely

230
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,560
valid reason right there may be you know

231
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,169
negative aspects to it but it's always

232
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,669
something that you know it's always

233
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,780
something that is justifiable or where

234
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,020
you can look through the history and say

235
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,510
like okay that day and that makes sense

236
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,699
you know so you know what what changed

237
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,870
over time from the easy days where you

238
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,820
could just you know blast away at

239
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,049
something you'll work through your work

240
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,270
through your pen testing or your

241
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,510
assessment checklist you know - now

242
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,400
where you know for certain security

243
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,380
people are folks that haven't maintained

244
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,420
their skills you know it's like the it's

245
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,000
like 2001 you know with a monkey a

246
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,530
monkey and the obelisk and like you know

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,520
what is this new thing that we're seeing

248
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:01,949
here I think it's important to start and

249
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,620
look at the why why has the way

250
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,900
organizations developed applications why

251
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,730
is that changed over time from these

252
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,170
monolithic giant applications you know

253
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,330
web server database server may be

254
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,829
talking to one or two other things you

255
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,830
know to include all this more

256
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,000
and I'll curl the pentesters out there

257
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,410
it's not so that you get to like go to

258
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,690
conferences and learn cool new things

259
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,850
right unfortunately that is a side

260
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,620
effect in a lot of cases of or an

261
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,100
implication of you know the things that

262
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,510
changed but what we saw in looking

263
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,170
across organizations that we're dealing

264
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:39,720
with is their marketing over uses this

265
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,640
their kind of beats this beats this term

266
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,680
to death but this concept of digital

267
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,290
transformation right where organizations

268
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,000
have to you know really face risk if

269
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,280
they don't move their business to

270
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,800
embrace a lot more of the digital

271
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,480
approach and a great example that is

272
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,339
from talking to my business partner John

273
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,350
Dix and he contrasted two trips he took

274
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,930
you know one where he flew on the

275
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,550
airline and you know you know as he

276
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,050
landed he got a text from the rental car

277
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,819
company saying hey your cars in this

278
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,199
spot Houston to show up you know here

279
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,940
drive out sure your driver license and

280
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,430
you're done versus another trip where

281
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,660
landed you know saw nothing from the

282
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,219
rental car company went to the rental

283
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,990
car had to go to the desk they showed

284
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,660
him finally to his car it turned out

285
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,100
that car the license plate was expired

286
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,480
so they had to go get in another car and

287
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,950
then they to watch that car first and it

288
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,050
was just this really really negative

289
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,690
experience and so you could see the

290
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,400
contrast between in the first case an

291
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,320
organization that had their act together

292
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,329
internally with all the systems tracking

293
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,440
all these things and they also had their

294
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,510
act together with their business

295
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,490
partners so they knew this person's on

296
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,590
this flight when they land they what

297
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,000
they care about from me is here's what

298
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,350
you're gonna do with your car right so

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,210
that integrated you know so-called

300
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,220
digital experience versus an

301
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,050
organization that you didn't have their

302
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,850
act together internally to say nothing

303
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,500
of being able to integrate their systems

304
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,300
across their business partners to

305
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,460
provide this really valuable experience

306
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,859
to their customers right and so if you

307
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,450
contrast these two experiences from

308
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,200
somebody who buys a lot of plane tickets

309
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,510
and rinse a lot of cars the risk that we

310
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,130
talked about in security right like all

311
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,800
the risks that we talked about in last

312
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,900
con or at blackhat or at DEFCON like

313
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,300
that risk for the most part is crap from

314
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,000
a business standpoint right the real

315
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,770
risk to businesses is they're going to

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,510
be out innovated by their competitors

317
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,520
they're going to be out just simply out

318
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,610
running out innovated by new entrants

319
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,329
into their markets and a failure to

320
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,689
address that risk is an exit

321
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:34,299
central risk right gdpr fines suck PCI

322
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:37,179
audits suck right breach you're doing

323
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:38,709
breach notifications sucks right what

324
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:40,569
really sucks is having to go lay off

325
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:42,819
tens of thousands of people because you

326
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:44,019
Zig when the market sagged right and so

327
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:45,998
that's I think an important thing to

328
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,989
understand is that from a business

329
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:51,549
standpoint they're not adopting these

330
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:53,019
technologies because they're cool right

331
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:55,149
they're in an environment where they

332
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,579
have to go faster all right how do you

333
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:59,290
go faster you know as I read in an

334
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:00,819
airline magazine clearly clearly the way

335
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,230
to go faster is DevOps right we need to

336
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,429
reduce the barriers between the

337
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,259
development teams and the operations

338
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:06,369
teams and hopefully security gets

339
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,439
included right

340
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:10,209
well when the culture changes to DevOps

341
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:12,219
you have to adopt new technologies to

342
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,199
support this mission right so you see

343
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,749
organizations that are making changes

344
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,969
going from a monolithic architecture I'm

345
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:21,100
gonna build an app to do one thing two

346
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,629
sets of micro services right I need the

347
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,559
different parts of my business to be

348
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,899
able to talk about what they're doing

349
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,629
but I need to be able to compose and

350
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,369
recompose those parts of our business to

351
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:33,129
create new products I need to be able to

352
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:34,809
innovate faster all right and then that

353
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:36,879
then has an implication for the

354
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,679
technologies that get selected right we

355
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,449
want Cloud Servers so that we can scale

356
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,549
up and scale down easily provision stuff

357
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:44,709
right developers want cloud services so

358
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:46,149
hey I don't want to run my own MongoDB

359
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:47,919
can I just get that from somewhere else

360
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:49,449
that's fantastic right we've got

361
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,739
containers how do we make it so that we

362
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,019
can deploy this stuff and it works the

363
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:55,119
same every time right and we can wrap a

364
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,589
thing around it server list even better

365
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:57,970
we don't even have to have servers we

366
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:59,379
can just have logic that floats around

367
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,360
out there and somebody else has to worry

368
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,429
about this and adopting things like CI

369
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,989
CD pipelines right we need to be able to

370
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:07,419
make new software builds and very

371
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:09,040
quickly determine is this build

372
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,309
something that is acceptable to put into

373
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,259
production or not and so that's the

374
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,730
that's that's the context that we see

375
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,679
with a lot of organizations where

376
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,149
they're from from a very strategic risk

377
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,220
management saying we have this

378
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:23,610
existential risk and that's gonna then

379
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,009
flow down to how we build applications

380
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,439
right and so what that then does to the

381
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:30,850
security team is it says you're either

382
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:34,360
on board with this or you're gonna get

383
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,549
marginalized so for all the folks that

384
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,769
are you know frustrated with cloud

385
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,369
transitions in your organization's I get

386
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,539
it

387
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:41,769
you know for all the folks that are

388
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:42,939
frustrated with the way that

389
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,069
developers are adopting new technologies

390
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:46,569
that like wacky rates and doing all

391
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:48,790
kinds of crazy different stuff and not

392
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:50,110
standardizing I understand that

393
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,910
frustration but I think it's really

394
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,179
important to understand the context in

395
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,699
which those decisions are being made as

396
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:59,379
an aside right for organizations like if

397
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:00,670
you couldn't make one big thing if you

398
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,829
couldn't make it one big monolithic

399
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,059
application work right like what makes

400
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:05,589
you think you're gonna make you know be

401
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:07,029
able to make like 30 things that need to

402
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:09,699
talk to one another work right right so

403
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,290
that's that is one question that I ask a

404
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:14,290
lot of organizations is they're kind of

405
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,939
willy-nilly diving into the your the

406
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,959
world of micro services you know cuz

407
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,429
everybody thinks this is how they're

408
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,339
gonna work right all happy and friendly

409
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:22,839
together you're really the picture

410
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:25,059
especially when folks are getting

411
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,439
started and understanding you know it

412
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:31,029
looks a little bit it looks a little bit

413
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:32,529
more like this so the way that we've you

414
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,179
know over time and working with

415
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,249
organizations and looking at different

416
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:39,069
applications what we've kind of boiled

417
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:41,249
this down to is something that I four

418
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:43,719
blog post and conference title purposes

419
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:46,660
you know it's called like the AIDS the

420
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,189
A's B's and four C's of thinking about

421
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,790
assessments for cloud native

422
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:53,349
applications so the first thing we'll

423
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,660
talk about is an architectural bill and

424
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,040
materials and you know and there's been

425
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,299
a lot of discussion about software Bill

426
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,679
of Materials what I'm talking about as

427
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:02,019
an architectural bill of materials

428
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:05,259
foreign application and then we'll look

429
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:08,290
at the four C's code components compute

430
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:10,029
and the cloud configuration maybe that

431
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,949
maybe the maybe we need five C's or the

432
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:16,540
fifth C needs to be lowercase I don't

433
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:19,240
know so when you look at a software Bill

434
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,699
of Materials right that's a concept that

435
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,779
has come out of a lot of work you know

436
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:24,939
coming out of both the public and

437
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,129
private sector it's something where Josh

438
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:29,769
Corman has done a lot of work in various

439
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,899
roles looking at this but the question

440
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:34,149
is I've got this software right I've got

441
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,980
this individual piece of software what

442
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,929
is actually in the software that I'm

443
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,100
shipping you know what are the open

444
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,779
source components potentially other

445
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,759
components but just knowing when I ship

446
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,019
this software what are the open source

447
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,879
components we pulled in what are the

448
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,379
different versions what version of the

449
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,029
code that I wrote is in there how do I

450
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,490
know for a give and build what's in that

451
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,379
bill right and this is something is

452
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,939
really important I mean just from you

453
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,829
know it

454
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:57,389
in general I think you know that's

455
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,919
that's something that is certainly very

456
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,199
very sensible to want to know about your

457
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:04,439
software and especially when you look at

458
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,508
the vulnerabilities that you get from

459
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:08,279
your supply chain right vulnerabilities

460
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,139
in the components that you're using to

461
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,549
build your software you know that's a

462
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,869
very important question as well and

463
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,029
that's something that we've seen as a

464
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:16,739
software vendor we're starting to get a

465
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,389
lot more questions from organizations

466
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:20,129
where they're saying oh yeah by the way

467
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:21,479
we need a list of all the open source

468
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:23,069
components in your software because we

469
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:24,479
want to like attach that as an appendix

470
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:26,189
to the contract or something like that

471
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:27,959
right so as a software vendor we're

472
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:29,429
starting to see that and from the really

473
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,899
sophisticated folks when we when we

474
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:32,608
deliver that to them occasionally we get

475
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,179
questions back hey for these three

476
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,409
components

477
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:35,848
you know why haven't you upgraded this

478
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,709
one you know tell me how you're using

479
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:39,479
this one and explain a little bit more

480
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,459
about about what this is doing in the

481
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:43,379
application right so this is something

482
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,268
that you know the organizations are

483
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:48,599
starting to pay a lot more a lot more

484
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:50,429
attention to and I'll highlight two

485
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:53,369
projects you know one is dependency

486
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:55,108
check a loss project that does software

487
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:57,809
composition analysis looks for the use

488
00:16:55,109 --> 00:17:00,419
of vulnerable components and a related a

489
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:02,819
different but your a related project is

490
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,349
Steve spring its dependency track that

491
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:06,059
is really centered around how do we

492
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,408
craft or how do we craft and track these

493
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,990
software bill and materials for

494
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:14,009
individual applications you're both both

495
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:17,009
really exceptional projects but for our

496
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:18,000
purposes or for assessment purposes as

497
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:20,339
we look at these cloud native

498
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,929
applications you know the question that

499
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,730
I'm asking or the course that we're

500
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:26,129
asking to looking at this is loads it's

501
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,409
more even a broader question if from an

502
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:31,019
architectural standpoint what goes into

503
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:33,779
this application alright so how do we

504
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:35,639
know you know how do we actually know

505
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:36,960
what all the pieces are of the

506
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,969
application not just looking at the

507
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,500
individual microservice of the

508
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,210
individual web front-end but how do we

509
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,490
know all of the pieces that are part of

510
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,769
this software because in the absence of

511
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,860
that knowledge how can we make any

512
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:51,629
meaningful assertions about the level of

513
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,639
security of that system as a whole right

514
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:55,320
that's that's a really big problem if

515
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,699
you don't know all of the parts of the

516
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,320
system that you're using which is why

517
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,519
it's really interesting again from those

518
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,289
interviews finding out hey we've got

519
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,000
this you know all this stuff and it's

520
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,408
all in AWS but we have this other

521
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,450
provider we've got a dedicated server

522
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:07,110
okay good what now that's all part of

523
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,700
the overall

524
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,379
tax searches this application you're the

525
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,110
same thing looking at our system hey

526
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,760
we're using more cloud components than

527
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,229
from a governance or from a security

528
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
standpoint at one point in time we

529
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,480
thought we knew so we learn more stuff

530
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,580
about that

531
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,260
so with the architectural building

532
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,360
materials the question is like what are

533
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,250
the pieces of the system that we're

534
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,469
looking at and being able to answer the

535
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,410
questions of what are the various parts

536
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,000
of this system you know what are they

537
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,070
consists of what what are all these like

538
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,080
sub parts of this that are rolled up to

539
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,629
what is each part of this system

540
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,918
supposed to do and also very important

541
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,740
where are you know where are these

542
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,620
pieces hosted because that's gonna have

543
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,450
implications you know again it's if it's

544
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,459
hosted in AWS environment its hosts and

545
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,200
Azure you know they've got certain

546
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,540
policies and procedures in place if it's

547
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,740
hosted in a in the Rackspace cloud it's

548
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,200
probably gonna be subject to different

549
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,299
controls than something in a dedicated

550
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,130
you know hosted as a dedicated server

551
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,929
and so knowing where these things are

552
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,360
hosted is important from a standpoint of

553
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:08,100
what governance and controls can I

554
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,678
expect in these environments you know

555
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,600
and from a testing standpoint what level

556
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,240
of testing or what testing activities

557
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,799
would I even be able to undertake if I

558
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,900
wanted to learn more about the security

559
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,100
of the system right you know is this

560
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
something where I can go and do whatever

561
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,520
testing I want it's in my data center as

562
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,710
long as I don't aggravate our corporate

563
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,570
policies or is this something where the

564
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,919
cloud vendor is gonna have some opinions

565
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,659
about the type of testing that can be

566
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,070
done right can I test this what if I

567
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,450
test something that's gonna you know

568
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,010
potentially spill over to someone else's

569
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,510
data you know nobody probably wants you

570
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,040
to do in denial service testing and so

571
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:42,030
that's again these are these are very

572
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:44,820
important things to understand but then

573
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,790
you might say that that sounds like a

574
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,399
threat model or at least a pretty good

575
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,600
portion of a threat model and I would I

576
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,160
would have fewer hits yeah it's pretty

577
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,168
much a threat model as understanding

578
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,020
what are the pieces of the system how

579
00:19:55,169 --> 00:20:00,510
are they talking together and that's

580
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,700
then going to inform you know when we

581
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,169
look at the security of the system and

582
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,190
especially when we do security testing

583
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,020
that's going to put us in a better

584
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,030
situation that knowledge is gonna put us

585
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,330
in a better situation where we can

586
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,070
characterize the risks associated with

587
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:18,570
any vulnerabilities or issues that we

588
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:20,520
find so just really it's PD here from a

589
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,620
you know from from a high level you know

590
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,300
threat modeling process you would get a

591
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,800
decide on scope what's in scope and

592
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,110
what's not in scope I think Tanya made a

593
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,370
great point in her talk where people say

594
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,590
well these micro services aren't in

595
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,989
scope and they're like they're in scope

596
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,970
for bad guys right they're in scope for

597
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,380
bad guys you know what what are the

598
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,240
rationale behind leaving them out of

599
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,950
scope for this testing you build your

600
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,650
data flow diagram so you understand how

601
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,020
the pieces fit together like the steps 1

602
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,820
& 2 or really what we need for this

603
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,410
architectural bill of materials but then

604
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,580
we look at well how do we enumerate the

605
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,770
threats and how do we decide on

606
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,110
mitigations right those are the things

607
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:58,020
that you're ultimately going to have to

608
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,209
be able to speak to when you you know

609
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,470
when you're reporting or characterizing

610
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,570
the risk associated with anything you

611
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,590
find so it may make sense to get those

612
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:09,629
out of the way at at the current time

613
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,770
again III still like there's different

614
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,010
approaches I don't know if anybody had

615
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,990
the opportunity to do to do the through

616
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,850
the free threat modeling sessions either

617
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,680
the morning or afternoon yesterday heard

618
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,820
those are really good a lot a lot of

619
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,160
stuff out there about threat modeling I

620
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,370
still you know again like the your

621
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,630
DeMarco data flow diagram type stuff you

622
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,979
know we're you numerate here all the

623
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,350
different pieces in the system here's

624
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,270
how they're talking to one another and

625
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,679
then identify the threats to that data

626
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,240
flow right so if I've external

627
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,100
interactors hey how am i concerned about

628
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,720
them spoofing how am i concerned about

629
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,159
repudiation for actions they may or may

630
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,960
not have taken you know for data flows

631
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,670
hi you know what am i you know what how

632
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,140
am i concerned about people tampering

633
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,270
with the information coming across this

634
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,650
data flow or unauthorized people getting

635
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,290
access to the information or someone

636
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,450
being able to stop that data flow and so

637
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,250
on and so forth and so again take all

638
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,840
the assets associate the threat types

639
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,490
with an asset and voila you've got a

640
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,709
list of now you've got a list of things

641
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,380
that you need to worry about which is

642
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,630
also really handy from a from an

643
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,880
assessment targeting standpoint you know

644
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,680
it gives you a starting list of the type

645
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,110
of things from a design and architecture

646
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,880
standpoint that you probably need to

647
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,590
incorporate into the way that you're

648
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,260
planning to do your testing to the way

649
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:21,090
you're planning to do your assessments

650
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,350
so again you know for for the

651
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,580
architecture building materials we need

652
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,590
at least results in step one and two

653
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,850
it's a situation where you probably want

654
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,260
to finish those things off because your

655
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,770
need you're going to need the rest later

656
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,770
to provide context for

657
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,600
reporting so given the architectural

658
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:41,920
bill given the architectural build

659
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:43,899
materials you know what we need to

660
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,480
basically go through and now we have the

661
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,590
list of the pieces of the system and

662
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,080
while we need to figure out what are the

663
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,760
security tasks that we would under to

664
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,230
undertake what are the assessment tasks

665
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,110
where that what are the testing tools we

666
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,060
might use on each piece in order to

667
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:02,139
understand the security of the

668
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:04,120
individual pieces you know for that you

669
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,160
know what we look at is you know what

670
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,439
I'd call after the A's and B's is now

671
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,910
the four C's in the end of the code what

672
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,340
code did we write that is running in

673
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,840
this part of the system components what

674
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,189
are the components that we've rolled up

675
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
you know code that we didn't write but

676
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,150
that is impacting the security of the

677
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,400
system from a compute standpoint like

678
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,260
what type of you know from a processing

679
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,110
standpoint an operating system like what

680
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,879
house this code actually being run and

681
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,490
then the cloud configuration what cloud

682
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,140
assets wrapped this that you know that

683
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,240
we didn't write or we don't control but

684
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:38,290
that make up you know and have an input

685
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,460
on the security of the system so you

686
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,770
know code again this is the code you

687
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,960
write this is the business logic that

688
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,910
makes your application do whatever stuff

689
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,280
it is that is valuable to your

690
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,960
organization also the glue code that you

691
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,240
use to you know attach to other stuff

692
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,460
and this is really you know looking back

693
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,870
through that might my history with oscar

694
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,580
having interacted or worked with Oh

695
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,830
awesome and participated in OAuth for

696
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,870
you know for 15 years or so a long time

697
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,970
now this has been the traditional focus

698
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,250
of wasp and the traditional focus of

699
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,560
application security all right I wrote

700
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,540
some code tell me about the security of

701
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,940
the code I wrote and you can do

702
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,620
automated testing for these you know

703
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,690
with your your static analysis tools

704
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,159
with your dynamic analysis tools now

705
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,470
with your interactive application

706
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,360
security testing tools and this is also

707
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,150
you know typically the focus of your

708
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,310
manual penetration testing in manual

709
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,650
code review right and so the code stuff

710
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,129
is really looking at you know again like

711
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,020
what what Olas did for the first 12 or

712
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,490
so you know twelve or so years or ten or

713
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,200
so years looking back through the

714
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,700
history this was really the focus right

715
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,110
and that was you know I mean

716
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,100
groundbreaking at the time it wasn't

717
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,928
something a lot of our

718
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,760
musicians were looking at and I would

719
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:48,340
argue that like this is still an area

720
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,929
that has not been solved you know some

721
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,178
organizations very mature doing very

722
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:54,309
well other organizations you know lag

723
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:55,900
lag behind are just now realizing that

724
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:57,309
the code they write you know it's not

725
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,080
just the server's they deploy but the

726
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:01,899
code they write exposes them to weakness

727
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,460
and so in a lot of ways a frightening

728
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,710
thing about the sort of frustrating

729
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:10,120
thing from a security standpoint is like

730
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:11,520
even this wasn't a solved problem and

731
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,549
now the problems being made

732
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,980
significantly more complex and so yeah

733
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:20,350
that's a again if frustrate a

734
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,049
frustrating aspect of this but you know

735
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,158
again like if nobody you know the world

736
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:25,240
doesn't necessarily care about your

737
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,929
feelings it's something that you've got

738
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,669
to you've got to find a way to deal with

739
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,409
what further makes this a little more a

740
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:35,260
little more aggravating or interesting

741
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:37,510
is you know the API testing right now a

742
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,129
lot of these communications you know

743
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,780
even on the web front end it's single

744
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,370
page applications that are talking back

745
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,928
to services if you look at things

746
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,850
talking behind the web frontend those

747
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:48,340
are also potentially micro services and

748
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,830
a lot of the traditional dynamic testing

749
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,049
tools don't necessarily have a great

750
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,370
answer for api testing now you know the

751
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:55,690
Zap folks have some interesting

752
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,129
capabilities they've developed in this

753
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,110
area a couple of the commercial vendors

754
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,700
have made that a priority to say you

755
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,240
know we need to be able to do directed

756
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,340
fuzzing on these on these api's but it's

757
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,700
not something that is spread entirely

758
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,918
across all the players in the space and

759
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,480
so all the code testing that you were

760
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,919
just getting your you know kind of mind

761
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,210
wrapped around before and you just kind

762
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,980
of felt like you had your vendor mix

763
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,870
locked in you're the world might have

764
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,429
shifted out from under you for new

765
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:25,360
applications that are gonna be developed

766
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:27,700
in your organization next we look at the

767
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,229
components so how do all these you know

768
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,789
what are all the additional things that

769
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,640
we snap together that are going to

770
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,870
support the code that we've written you

771
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,809
know these are typically open-source

772
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:40,030
components you know and again like I I

773
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:41,649
love open-source components because that

774
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,600
means that I don't have to write a lot

775
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,309
of code right just from an economic

776
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,959
standpoint it's not it would be

777
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:49,120
preposterous to say we're not gonna use

778
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,890
any open-source I always I always enjoy

779
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,389
again you know as a software vendor we

780
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,130
get questions for purchasing departments

781
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:57,010
like you and

782
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:59,530
open-source code in your application I'm

783
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,150
like like what world do you live in

784
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,070
right like how much software have you

785
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,299
bought in the last whenever that you

786
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,620
know where that where there's where

787
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,700
nobody's using where there's no open

788
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,709
source code unless you're doing some

789
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,710
like real wacky like focused embedded

790
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,480
stuff you know that's uh that's simply

791
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,760
not it's simply not the case

792
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,080
you know for for any organization that

793
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:27,700
we've dealt with or our stuff is there a

794
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:30,490
question a great great question so the

795
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,980
question is is do I consider license

796
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:37,809
risk to be rolled up as a knapsack

797
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:39,700
concern I typically see it as a very

798
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:42,039
important concern but one is orthogonal

799
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,419
to what most of the application security

800
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:45,070
folks care about you know that's

801
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,390
something that purchasing tends to care

802
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,418
about it's something the legal tends to

803
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,490
care about compliance you know from an

804
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:54,370
app sex standpoint I usually try to kind

805
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:56,289
of throw that overboard again as a as a

806
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,149
software vendor we certainly care about

807
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:59,890
that you know but but when we're working

808
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,630
with organizations and working with

809
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:05,020
security teams they typically view their

810
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,299
mission as dealing with the risk of

811
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,400
breach and it's someone else is

812
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,840
concerned to worry about the license

813
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,610
risk and there there may be like shared

814
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,289
activities again a lot of the commercial

815
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,689
players in the space will do your

816
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:18,730
license on it while you're doing your

817
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:22,059
you know and so there's kind of a dual

818
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,740
use most app SEC teams that I can think

819
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,210
of it and that certainly not universal I

820
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,010
can think of cases you know but

821
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,110
typically it's a corporate or a legal

822
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,510
policy that is then pushed down to the

823
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,219
dev team you know the app security folks

824
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,750
are looking at one thing it's a related

825
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,490
activity but at the end of the day there

826
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,780
are different stakeholders but that's an

827
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,679
excellent question and gets to some of

828
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,418
the stuff we'll talk about in a couple

829
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,740
minutes about like reporting and how do

830
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,120
you characterize these things because

831
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,970
again if I'm going to the development

832
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,889
team it's a security person I'm saying

833
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,760
like you trust me you really don't want

834
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,640
this version of struts in your

835
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,590
application I assure you

836
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,539
right whereas legal might be coming to

837
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,428
them and saying like hey in this package

838
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:59,140
software that we sell like this a GPL or

839
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:01,299
the GPL three stuff that you put in

840
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,370
there like we need to find a workaround

841
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:03,990
for that typically though I see those as

842
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,949
orthogonal

843
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,630
concerns that's really a good question

844
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:11,400
now so this like component stuff really

845
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,020
gained prominence again about six years

846
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,420
ago when it got included in the OWASP

847
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,100
top 10 in 2013

848
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,690
so really gained prominence there were

849
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,449
some commercial vendors that were very

850
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,490
excited to have that included which is

851
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,500
which is kind of what it is but as we've

852
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:30,210
seen with things like the Equifax breach

853
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:32,460
you know we've we've we've like seen

854
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,380
situations where it is you know

855
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,660
certainly a very valid concern so thank

856
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,100
you struts

857
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,340
struts is like the salesperson of the

858
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,980
year for XYZ software composition

859
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:46,860
analysis vendor I'm sure they love I'm

860
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,929
sure they love the struts folks so so

861
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,159
how do you test for this right you know

862
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,420
typically you're gonna test with some

863
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,280
sort of a cell for composition and

864
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,570
analysis tool that's going to watch the

865
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,470
build see what are the components that

866
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,389
we pull in what are the dependencies

867
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,740
that get pulled in let's check the

868
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,200
versions that are being pulled in and

869
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,740
then check those versions against a list

870
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,330
of the of known vulnerabilities and then

871
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,550
the more sophisticated ones will go in

872
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,590
and say hey based on some control flow

873
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,178
or data flow analysis of the code you

874
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,220
know does it look like the use of this

875
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,540
component in this application puts you

876
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,640
in a situation where you're using those

877
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,220
vulnerable functions and this is again

878
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,440
very much related to the traditional

879
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,059
software a bill of materials scope and I

880
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,040
really encourage folks who maybe don't

881
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,840
have any sort of practices in place a

882
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,090
great way to get started is to use like

883
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,290
a loss of dependency check and it would

884
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,280
be helpful if I was on the slide that

885
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,740
had all the things that we were talking

886
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,480
about there and these are all be online

887
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,260
and all that so so so four components

888
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,030
you've got your code you've got

889
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,000
components the next question is like

890
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:46,020
what's running all this code right like

891
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,640
do you know somewhere there's a

892
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,110
processor that is like you know moving

893
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,520
zeros and ones around and making

894
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,620
decisions and branching and doing stuff

895
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:56,040
you know something has to run all that

896
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,870
code and you know in you know in the

897
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,340
current environment you know that can be

898
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,610
things like virtual servers it can be

899
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:05,100
virtual machines it can be cloud servers

900
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:07,080
containers very popular server list also

901
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,490
takes this to the extreme right where's

902
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,050
the compute I don't know you know likely

903
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,990
that's totally not our problem and

904
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,639
that's fantastic and as we've learned

905
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,020
from earlier you know don't forget our

906
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,210
about our good friends the dead

907
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,160
servers and how do you test this you

908
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,570
test these depending on the

909
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,550
configuration you can test them with

910
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,639
more traditional vulnerability scanners

911
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:28,919
you know koala stenosis next pose you

912
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,570
know and with newer technologies like

913
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,110
The Container vulnerability scanning or

914
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,360
the container

915
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,010
you know container scanning that looks

916
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,969
for you know known vulnerabilities

917
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,070
misconfigurations

918
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,260
you know know like malicious containers

919
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,970
and things like that and so you know two

920
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,770
different kinds of tool sets that are

921
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,710
you know at different levels of maturity

922
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,600
and modernity modernity you know

923
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,510
depending on like what are you actually

924
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,360
relying on to run you to run this code

925
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:57,090
that you have and then finally our

926
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,100
fourth and or fifth C's are the cloud

927
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,020
configuration and I'll be the first to

928
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,449
admit this is the squishiest of all the

929
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:06,810
C's right maybe that's me that's why it

930
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,400
gets to C's I don't know and right now

931
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,169
this is largely configuration checks

932
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,910
right because the question is for the

933
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,350
cloud environment that is that is

934
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,880
surrounding this what are the

935
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,740
configurations you know what are the

936
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,380
configurations of how these cloud

937
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,730
components are set up what are things

938
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,710
supposed to be able to talk to how do

939
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,230
they handle you know how they handle a

940
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,060
identity and access management you know

941
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:30,360
do you have things like very well known

942
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,980
issues like open s3 buckets right and

943
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,300
this is something that I very much see

944
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,590
evolving over time you know if this

945
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,540
presentation were given a couple years

946
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,639
ago you know cloud servers might fall

947
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:42,690
into this type of category just because

948
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,300
of a lack of understanding of how those

949
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:48,090
worked versus other servers again if you

950
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,919
know if I give a similar talk to this in

951
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,929
in five years you know maybe we'll have

952
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,300
an additional C you know as things

953
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,160
become more stable to say okay well

954
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,659
we've got these very well-known specific

955
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,100
cloud services and these have become

956
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,330
central enough to the way that

957
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,639
organizations are deploying applications

958
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,780
and consistent enough you know maybe

959
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,250
this would be something where we'd look

960
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,830
and say okay we've got it like an entire

961
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:10,830
new like assessment methodology set of

962
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,929
tooling around how we do again X Y Z you

963
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,540
know hosted MongoDB or whatever whatever

964
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:17,100
that might be and so so this is again

965
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,870
kind of the squishiest and right now a

966
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,179
lot of the tools in the space are really

967
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:23,129
doing configuration checks to say you

968
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,320
know you you've turned on some sort of a

969
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,580
cloud-based thing that's going to be a

970
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,439
part of this application what are the

971
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,418
rules that you you know for the controls

972
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,370
that you have the ability to enforce

973
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,380
their what are the rules that you have

974
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:39,620
put in place for how that thing should

975
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,620
if so how that things should behave so

976
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,299
what does this all look like I provided

977
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,049
this illustration to our marketing team

978
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:49,970
and they wept right because the way I

979
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:52,250
think of this is you've got you've got

980
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,830
the your code which is a bunch of silly

981
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,179
putty and it's sitting on top of some

982
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,820
Lego bricks that have been snapped

983
00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:00,500
together and that's a and those are the

984
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,879
components and that's an analogy I stole

985
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,889
I think from from Jeff Williams who's

986
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,940
speaking I think tomorrow certainly

987
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:06,260
check him out if you have the

988
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,490
opportunity but so we've got a bunch of

989
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,429
silly putty that we have a lot of

990
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,409
control over that sits on top of some

991
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:13,820
some Lego bricks that we have to snap

992
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,280
together but don't really have as many

993
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:19,520
choices the configuration of you know

994
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,290
that all is being driven by some sort of

995
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,330
an engine that is the compute and then

996
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,619
that runs on tracks that have different

997
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,219
switches and things you can follow and

998
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:29,720
that's your cloud configuration again I

999
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:33,109
put that too I put that to our marketing

1000
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:36,348
me I'm like you get it and they were

1001
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:38,299
like no Dan no Dan we're not gonna make

1002
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:42,379
a pretty graphic of that for you so you

1003
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,450
get my drawing so I'm still I'm still

1004
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:46,029
trying to figure out like how do we how

1005
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:48,439
do we what's like what's a better way to

1006
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,659
you know to conceptualize or think about

1007
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,190
this that really crappy way is is

1008
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,470
currently my best to breed thinking

1009
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,260
again happy to take happy to take

1010
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:58,790
suggestions later on or if someone is a

1011
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,650
better artist than me wants to make that

1012
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,869
look better you're more than welcome to

1013
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,450
do that as well

1014
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:07,040
and so you know what were your what

1015
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,629
we're looking at from a from an

1016
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,000
assessment standpoint is what are all

1017
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,740
the different pieces and what are the

1018
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,540
security characteristics of each of

1019
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,879
these individual pieces right based on

1020
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,430
you know code components compute cloud

1021
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,920
configuration and then given the

1022
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,240
interaction of those components you know

1023
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,250
how do you know how do those

1024
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,379
interactions you know potentially you

1025
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,460
know characterize the the risk that

1026
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,589
we're gonna face is it from the

1027
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,089
vulnerabilities that we find and from a

1028
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,910
reporting standpoint I think it's really

1029
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:36,799
important to understand your audience

1030
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,910
because if it was hard enough to

1031
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,740
characterize in a monolithic a pin vise

1032
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,359
here's what hey we found this

1033
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,828
vulnerability here's why you need to be

1034
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,269
scared about it how much you should be

1035
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:47,529
scared about it you know in an

1036
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,180
environment where you have multiple

1037
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:51,700
players multiple pieces all talking to

1038
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,740
one another like that gets even more

1039
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,180
challenging to characterize well you

1040
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,410
know - in order to exploit this they

1041
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,460
would have to find this which means

1042
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,379
they'd have to go through these steps

1043
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,000
then to exploit it they would have to

1044
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,009
have you know this window or whatever I

1045
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,259
think I think it's gotten a lot harder

1046
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:07,960
in more complex applications to

1047
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:09,609
characterize you know for weaknesses

1048
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,390
that we found or for vulnerabilities

1049
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:15,160
that we found what our how do we

1050
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,569
characterize this and so you know I

1051
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,058
think it's important to understand who

1052
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:21,369
are the consumers of what you are trying

1053
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:23,049
to your who are the consumers you're

1054
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:24,519
trying to communicate with you know is

1055
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:26,170
it security and risk management folks

1056
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:27,098
that are gonna understand and you know

1057
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,809
at a security level these

1058
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,730
vulnerabilities is it you know

1059
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:32,950
individual service owners or developers

1060
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,019
that maybe don't have a great idea of

1061
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,210
what they're doing how that rolls up

1062
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:38,799
into the big picture again that's

1063
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:41,740
something you need to be you need to be

1064
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:44,140
aware of and that's this is where that

1065
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,939
architectural bill of materials comes in

1066
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,109
handy because you can show here are the

1067
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,920
different pieces of the system here's

1068
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,288
how they fit together

1069
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,519
right here's the bad guy here's the

1070
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:53,170
steps they would go through again to

1071
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,879
this right and here's how we're gonna

1072
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,170
characterize it here's why we're worried

1073
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,980
about this and here's how much we're

1074
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,079
worried about it

1075
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,759
you know from the security and risk

1076
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,170
management folks there's different

1077
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:04,000
models for that you know risk is schools

1078
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,859
the impact of an incident times the

1079
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,450
likelihood of that happening you know

1080
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:08,680
again likelihood is something that I

1081
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,230
think has gotten a lot harder to

1082
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,058
characterize in these in these new

1083
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,799
cloud-based systems or cloud native

1084
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,579
systems just because of the complexity

1085
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,680
architecture

1086
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:19,059
I'm still a fan of dread no one else's

1087
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,269
that's fine

1088
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:25,000
a lot of organizations use the common

1089
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:26,529
vulnerability scoring second scoring

1090
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,809
system you know version you know

1091
00:37:26,529 --> 00:37:30,579
whatever version 1 version 2 version and

1092
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:31,900
I think threes coming out now you know

1093
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:34,329
where you have here here's our base

1094
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,519
metrics about the this vulnerabilities

1095
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:38,170
like em you know and its core what the

1096
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,089
problems are or the risks are with this

1097
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,890
vulnerability and from the environment

1098
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:43,210
that this ulnar ability can be found in

1099
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,410
here's a way to characterize that I

1100
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,299
think that's helpful in a lot of cases

1101
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,750
and a lot of times there's a narrative

1102
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:51,009
right so if a then B then C and again

1103
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,390
like what are you trying to communicate

1104
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:55,400
here your your base concerns for

1105
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,290
the risk for the exposure any compliance

1106
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,460
impact that might have any impact on

1107
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,980
service level agreement that you have

1108
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,020
with with customers you know learning

1109
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,180
looking at service owners looking at

1110
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,970
developers you know why should they care

1111
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,529
or why do they have to care you know

1112
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,810
I've said it before I'll say it again I

1113
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,190
think that from a curmudgeon point of

1114
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,230
view there's a perception that

1115
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,840
developers don't care about security I

1116
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:20,090
have not found that to be the case in

1117
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,860
the vast majority of my interactions you

1118
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,870
know I find that developers care about

1119
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,090
security and in lines of business care

1120
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:27,620
about security they care about risk but

1121
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,080
they also care about meeting deadlines

1122
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,270
fixing non security related bugs and a

1123
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,279
host of other things that are not often

1124
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,650
on the radar of security folks and so

1125
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,270
you have to characterize you know why is

1126
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,440
this something that you may need to care

1127
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,020
about and why you would choose to take

1128
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,160
action on this over something else you

1129
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,880
know and also characters and how do I

1130
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,740
fix this

1131
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,380
right it's one thing to go in and drop a

1132
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,669
PDF on somebody's desk and be like wow

1133
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,880
you must not be very good at developing

1134
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:58,310
because we found all these problems and

1135
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,710
that is satisfying but but if you want

1136
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:04,070
to get invited back you know and if you

1137
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:05,210
like your car not scratched up you'd

1138
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,350
probably want to come with a little bit

1139
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,000
more of that and I think that's

1140
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,589
something I've seen from Owasso that I

1141
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,290
really like about the OWASP community is

1142
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:14,050
a focus on not just on look at how lean

1143
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,490
i am and how i pwned your application

1144
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,780
there's also a lot of focus on hey how

1145
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,970
do we prioritize these and how do we

1146
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,930
come to the developers with something so

1147
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,939
that we're not just bringing their

1148
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,950
problems we're also bringing them if not

1149
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:28,790
solutions then at least the building by

1150
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:31,129
building blocks for solutions another

1151
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,200
challenge with these with with testing

1152
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:36,830
these cloud native applications is you

1153
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,210
have to make tough decisions about what

1154
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,220
activities you want to undertake and

1155
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,080
which ones you don't right anybody here

1156
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,629
already most of the folks here work in

1157
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,730
security all right how many people have

1158
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,560
all the resources they want right

1159
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,810
they've got all the team members they

1160
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,190
want all right they've got like all the

1161
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,170
tools they think they need to do their

1162
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,150
job right you know they've got all the

1163
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:58,520
time you know like no crunch schedules

1164
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:00,950
not having right I'm waiting waiting for

1165
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,360
the organization that that feels that

1166
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:05,149
way and I'm going to submit a job

1167
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,950
application immediately after I find

1168
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,110
them right

1169
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,569
so nobody has all the resources they

1170
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,550
want that's just the nature of security

1171
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,050
events the nature of life right I mean

1172
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,900
that's just like economics is like how

1173
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,340
to use incentives to drive decisions you

1174
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,440
know and and if you come in with an

1175
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,460
attitude of everything everything is

1176
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,660
important well if everything is

1177
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,610
important then nothing is important

1178
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,830
right if you can't prioritize and say of

1179
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:29,260
the ten things we've got these three are

1180
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,490
important you know these four I kind of

1181
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,840
care about and I'm willing to let these

1182
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,790
three just you know die on the vine

1183
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,590
because realistically we're just not

1184
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,779
gonna get to that stuff so you've got to

1185
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,610
ask questions you love the parts of our

1186
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,810
architectural bill of materials what

1187
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,510
services are dealing with the most

1188
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,770
critical data you know which components

1189
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,030
of the system just because of

1190
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,880
architecture aliyah where they sit

1191
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:51,040
expose the application and the

1192
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,350
underlying data to the greatest risk

1193
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,090
right are you more concerned that a

1194
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,940
container that nothing should be able to

1195
00:40:55,090 --> 00:41:00,070
connect to has a blank root password or

1196
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,020
you know possibly more concerned that

1197
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:04,210
your login routine has a cross-site

1198
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,680
scripting vulnerability exposed right so

1199
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,000
which type of vulnerabilities are really

1200
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,379
going to be the ones that cause you to

1201
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,090
take action or when you do your

1202
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,320
reporting to the risk management folks

1203
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,240
when you do your reporting to the

1204
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,830
business or the developers would be the

1205
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,270
ones that you really highlight because

1206
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,790
that's where you need to that's where

1207
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,050
you need to prioritize so depending on

1208
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,850
your architecture maybe you say you know

1209
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,380
hey anything that is public facing all

1210
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,120
the public facing web stuff public

1211
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,850
facing API is that's what the bad guys

1212
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,290
see they're gonna be able to do dynamic

1213
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,779
testing maybe I want to prioritize

1214
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:34,180
dynamic testing of those because that's

1215
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,390
gonna replicate most accurately what an

1216
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,770
attacker who's going to be able to do

1217
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,420
maybe you want cloud configuration

1218
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:43,210
checks right you say you know what these

1219
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,280
developers are new to using the cloud

1220
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,170
and they're using stuff they're not

1221
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,060
familiar with let's see if we can run

1222
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,950
some configuration checking to identify

1223
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,420
are there F three buckets that they

1224
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,430
didn't know about or that we didn't know

1225
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,400
about right you are there are there like

1226
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,690
you know identity and access management

1227
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,220
capabilities that you know should be in

1228
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,200
place but they just didn't know about it

1229
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,879
right so you can make decisions like

1230
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,859
that and you've got to prioritize the

1231
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,470
activities based on the resources you

1232
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,910
have available so for example if we go

1233
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:11,919
back and look at this media site

1234
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,440
all right web front-end a couple of web

1235
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,230
services so in s3 buckets Amazon or or a

1236
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,500
database hosted Mongo and our

1237
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,420
you know my you know kind of humorous

1238
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,070
example is the dedicated chat server

1239
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,200
you know what's the attack service well

1240
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:28,540
definitely known is going to be the web

1241
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,859
frontend and trivially able to you know

1242
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,810
trivially able to be identified to be

1243
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,950
the chat server and depending on you

1244
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:35,410
know what it's doing maybe that maybe

1245
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,029
the hosted MongoDB you know what's your

1246
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,770
additional exposure right we want to

1247
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:41,080
look at all you all the exposed network

1248
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,790
assets that we've got any IPS that are

1249
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,860
you know facing out you know in the

1250
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,330
cloud configuration are there parts of

1251
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:49,420
the system that maybe we didn't know

1252
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:51,610
about you know so we're gonna establish

1253
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,140
assets to establish this architectural

1254
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,850
Bill of Materials do our cloud

1255
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,640
configuration check to find out are

1256
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,930
there any like you know weird parts s3

1257
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,700
buckets we didn't know about our gross

1258
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,600
access management sins that have been

1259
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,120
committed

1260
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,700
you know network scan of any exposed IPS

1261
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,109
but the ones where we have controller we

1262
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,980
have the authority to scan those right

1263
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:12,010
that's something we talked about earlier

1264
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,930
you're within a cloudy environment where

1265
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,700
different players own different parts of

1266
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:18,310
the system you're testing rights you are

1267
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,290
potentially limited you know dynamic

1268
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:21,670
scan of the web front-end you know maybe

1269
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:24,400
some manual penetration testing

1270
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,350
depending on the budget you know and and

1271
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,580
and let's take a look and and see if we

1272
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,710
can do some fuzzing against the chat

1273
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,060
server and again maybe some manual

1274
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,200
penetration testing because again that's

1275
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,580
going to be part of the system that

1276
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,750
maybe we don't know a lot about but we

1277
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,370
do know it's going to be something is

1278
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,750
easily discoverable by somebody looking

1279
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,700
through and seeing how the site works if

1280
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,410
you have more resources maybe make a

1281
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,750
decision to do your manual testing of

1282
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,700
the web front-end you know more manual

1283
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,220
testing the chat server you know maybe

1284
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,990
do some you know dynamic or API scanning

1285
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,660
of the micro services supporting that

1286
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:54,310
web front-end you know maybe you do some

1287
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,170
static analysis manual code review the

1288
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,060
web front-end or those services you know

1289
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:59,830
interior network scanning so you don't

1290
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,840
have your cloud native app that's

1291
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:04,150
crunchy on the outside right for what

1292
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,880
parameter you actually do have you know

1293
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,290
in this environment or what perimeter

1294
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,450
you think you have maybe you also want

1295
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,890
to do some interior scanning if if it as

1296
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,930
it turns out your perimeters nothing

1297
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,430
like you thought it was maybe you start

1298
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:17,379
looking at some container images looking

1299
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:19,330
for malicious images misconfigurations

1300
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,130
you know and maybe you can work with the

1301
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,900
vendor of that MongoDB service to see

1302
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,880
hey let's talk about what you know you

1303
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,690
won't allow us to do testing but let's

1304
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,100
see

1305
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,410
you know let's see what sort of security

1306
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,360
assertions that you can make

1307
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:32,580
by your environment again like your list

1308
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,980
may vary but that's I think a really

1309
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,360
important thing is to recognize in an

1310
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,210
environment like this where the number

1311
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,360
of pieces of the system has exploded

1312
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,590
it's really proliferated and the parts

1313
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,380
of the system that you potentially would

1314
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,940
want to check has also has also expanded

1315
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,560
you're gonna have to make some

1316
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,900
potentially really tough decisions

1317
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,240
knowing your resources about like hey

1318
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,740
this is the first pass we're gonna do

1319
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,689
this is what we're going to do because

1320
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,759
we think this is gonna find the scariest

1321
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,530
stuff the fastest and then you know

1322
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,080
after that will you look for additional

1323
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,280
resources or reprioritize based on you

1324
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,880
know based on what we find or based on

1325
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,190
the resources we have available yeah so

1326
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,450
I've gotten let me think of how if you

1327
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,830
if you give me a card or if I'm but I'll

1328
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,950
see if I can find a way to find this

1329
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:18,870
that actually at last con last year I

1330
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:22,560
about the threat modeling specifically

1331
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:24,359
for IOT devices and medical was it was a

1332
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,130
sub component of that and so I think

1333
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,540
that works that fits very much into this

1334
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,280
model because what you're gonna see is

1335
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,410
again from a bill of material standpoint

1336
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,660
we've got a device it's running code

1337
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:35,040
it's talking you know potentially it

1338
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,839
potentially has a TAC surface from

1339
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,930
Bluetooth for updates and all this other

1340
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,460
stuff you know it may be talking to you

1341
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,620
know some sort of central services that

1342
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,940
are collecting data you know those are

1343
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,290
then you know feeding that to the Big

1344
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,050
Data engine or something like that and

1345
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:51,570
so this the same process works you know

1346
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,970
it's a question then of like you know

1347
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:56,910
that device is just another thing that

1348
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,770
feeds back into or it's another part of

1349
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,779
your architectural bill of materials and

1350
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,850
again there's you know for medical

1351
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,530
devices if you look at doing testing for

1352
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,240
those there's it's it's a little more

1353
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,740
that kind of specialized or focus just

1354
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,540
with the protocols that they speak and

1355
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,459
especially when you're looking at safety

1356
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,590
critical systems where hey if this is if

1357
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,570
this heart monitor decides to you know

1358
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:17,670
somebody says the sequal inject a heart

1359
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,410
monitor then you know then there can be

1360
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,160
unlike a death or you know some sort of

1361
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,129
a health impact

1362
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,480
so I would say that this this I think

1363
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,910
everything I've talked about today fits

1364
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,920
that and I would say for medical devices

1365
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,629
there are some additional concerns just

1366
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,890
because of the safety criticality and

1367
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:34,110
because that tends to be a somewhat more

1368
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,370
specialized area of testing and if you

1369
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,900
again if you give me a card I've got

1370
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,950
some some resources I can send you the

1371
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,400
talk yeah about that kind of more

1372
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,960
specialized area that's a great question

1373
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,180
so is a question is if you're if you're

1374
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,500
a cloud provider would the you would

1375
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,049
have thinking about that with the

1376
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:53,230
thinking about this change I think as a

1377
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:54,970
cloud provider and again if you want to

1378
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,040
talk afterward I can can provide some a

1379
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:58,720
little more specifics about this but as

1380
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,770
a cloud provider I think the important

1381
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,299
thing is to recognize that you're

1382
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:03,670
providing those fundamental building

1383
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:05,980
blocks and so you have the you know the

1384
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,480
same responsibilities that if anyone has

1385
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,740
building a line of business application

1386
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,089
right you're gonna have your clouds

1387
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,009
gonna have pieces gonna have a threat

1388
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:14,380
model architecture building materials

1389
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:16,930
but you also have the responsibility to

1390
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:19,210
provide those fundamental security

1391
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:21,098
controls and capabilities and expose

1392
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:24,190
them to the consumers of your system

1393
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:25,030
right so if you're making the I don't

1394
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,589
know where you're working if you're

1395
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:28,240
making a product that's for example

1396
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:31,480
called s for buckets that people can use

1397
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,189
for block storage you know or something

1398
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,140
else like that you know in addition to

1399
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,490
an in addition looking at the security

1400
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,920
of the system there's also an

1401
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:40,990
engineering you know kind of a an

1402
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,270
engineering and an engineering for third

1403
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,669
party use component that gets layered on

1404
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,980
top of that as well to say what security

1405
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,839
controls and configuration are we going

1406
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,910
to offer and how are we gonna expose

1407
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:54,009
that how are we gonna expose that to

1408
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,808
people that are consuming our service so

1409
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,970
that they can you know so that they can

1410
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:59,530
say well here's the identity and access

1411
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,180
management controls that we want here

1412
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:02,859
are the ways that I want things to be

1413
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,240
able to talk to one another using this

1414
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:07,180
building block service that we've

1415
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,470
created well thank you all very much

1416
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,470
I'll be around for a while and

1417
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,720
you

1418
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,150
you
