00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,260
hi everyone I'm Nathan welcome

3
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,290
so I actually working on me called gusto

4
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,800
so it's funny that no total raise at all

5
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,930
there's a company based in the UK called

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,720
gusto and we often get confused like

7
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,730
there are different tweets the cooking

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,220
subscription companies so oftentimes we

9
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,419
get tweets talking about how we didn't

10
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,000
deliver their food and we have to like

11
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,680
say no actually we do payroll software

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,140
I've been doing something very very

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,510
different it's fascinating to watch our

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,380
tweets come in and it was yeah so our

15
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,250
company called gusto

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:15,970
we do payroll benefits for small and

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,860
medium-sized businesses I was the first

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,429
application security engineer there and

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:26,080
for a moment of time I was also the only

20
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:30,100
member of the security team someone

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,110
start out with a little story initially

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,600
a lot of my co-workers and friends

23
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,670
thought that it was super cool that I

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,039
was the only one on the security team

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,920
they thought that I had a ton of power

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,549
and I could do whatever I want again as

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:53,439
the only member of the team but spoiler

28
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:55,299
alert I had no power then when they knew

29
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,520
that I was only member they wanted to

30
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:59,770
know more about it they were curious to

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,350
see what it actually entailed what my

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:07,780
day they would look like again as the

33
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:09,820
only team member on the team then as I

34
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,920
started to go over some of the

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,880
responsibilities and what my did they

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,640
looked like they realize oh wow this is

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,049
not fun this is a lot of work and maybe

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,369
some of you have been in the same place

39
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:27,940
where you feel overwhelmed understaffed

40
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:33,190
and honestly you just don't know what to

41
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:36,160
do so to sum it up that actually

42
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:40,000
represented a lot of my day today and

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,599
what I thought like in that I had a lot

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,860
of things stacked against me so I want

45
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,359
to take a step back

46
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:51,540
kind of go over what things I had to

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,240
face and what challenges had against me

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:59,230
so first off I was outnumbered by the

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,900
engineers from one to I think it was a

50
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,590
hundred ish at that time so as you can

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:10,150
imagine a lot of them and only one of me

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:12,670
and next gussto is a startup so there

53
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,980
are ever-changing priorities what is

54
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,049
important one quarter is probably not

55
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,019
important the next quarter a lot of

56
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:24,520
things going on trying to iterate and

57
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:26,950
move fast and then finally I was also in

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,320
individual contributor so I had no one

59
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,570
reporting to me didn't have any fancy

60
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,450
c-level title and I was just someone

61
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:44,530
pretty small and far down on the whole

62
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:46,780
Shane come in so the fixed input was my

63
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,959
time I only had a certain number of

64
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,860
hours in a day and for those who know me

65
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,600
I like to sleep like a lot I think like

66
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,500
eight nine ten hours so probably

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,019
unhealthy amount but again I wasn't

68
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:07,900
willing to give up my sleep so how could

69
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:10,090
I balance my work at gusto getting sleep

70
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,230
and everything else that I wanted to do

71
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:18,640
just as a millennial living in San

72
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:21,820
Francisco and I wanted to maximize my

73
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:26,680
output so how could I do that and let's

74
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,349
go ahead and dive into this so first off

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,710
I had several technical strategies that

76
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:37,330
I use and I want to go over with you I

77
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,599
think a lot of you are quite familiar

78
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:44,169
with the idea of shifting left correct

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,270
nothing new here but then there's one

80
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,940
term that Tania who was the keynote

81
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,669
speaker has been advocating for is the

82
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,419
idea of pushing left and this is the

83
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:58,599
concept of moving security as far left

84
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:01,169
as possible so even before

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,390
features are developed during the

86
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:06,100
ideation phase we're going to get

87
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:10,750
security involved at the very very

88
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:13,210
beginning so why was pushing or shifting

89
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,960
left so important for me and this is

90
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,159
because once the features the code has

91
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,039
been written some features have been

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,070
shipped then effectively there's nothing

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,080
I can do I'm not gonna be the one to

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,890
block the release and say no you can't

95
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,070
do this and all the code review it's

96
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,960
humanly impossible so I need to find a

97
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:39,280
way to insert myself at the very very

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,099
beginning to get at the very forefront

99
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,950
and see what the engineers and the rest

100
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:52,230
of the company wanted to ship and

101
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:55,780
produce so it's honest easy as ABC

102
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:58,930
always be coding so if you haven't seen

103
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,969
Dino daizo V's blackhat keynote this

104
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,280
past year he had an amazing talk where

105
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,660
he advocated that modern-day security

106
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,969
teams are most effective when they write

107
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,640
code and in fact they should be writing

108
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,160
code so I'm coming from a software

109
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,800
engineering background and I can confirm

110
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:23,230
that writing code is really really

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:27,070
powerful and during my time like in the

112
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:29,590
very beginning I often wrote code to

113
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,890
build security features for our teams so

114
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:38,799
whether it was trying to strengthen our

115
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:43,770
2fa flow or trying to improve some reset

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,510
password flow that in itself was

117
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:50,680
powerful because I had control over that

118
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:54,180
I was able to see what was going on with

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,770
the code in regards to the security and

120
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,810
then when reports would come in through

121
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,930
our bug bounty or append test reports

122
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,060
oftentimes I would go myself in the

123
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,560
codebase and create the poor class

124
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:12,510
themselves so one thing that may be a

125
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,120
bit controversial but is that I gained

126
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,460
instant respect from a lot of engineers

127
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,980
instead of being able to just like hand

128
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:25,419
it off and say hey go and fix this for

129
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:28,930
me by me showing them that I can hang

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:33,550
with you that I can write code that in

131
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:37,720
itself gained instant credibility and I

132
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:40,680
will say that even when I went over the

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,260
code reviews or the different design doc

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,980
reviews or flows by being able to point

135
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,539
out maybe some tiny flaw in the os/2

136
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,290
implementation then they were able to

137
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,910
trust me

138
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:58,510
that much more so by gaining that much

139
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:04,060
respect then I was able to create that

140
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:06,430
rapport with the engineering team so the

141
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,530
next thing I want over is the gap still

142
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,630
talking about software is that we should

143
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:14,200
be automating anything that's repeatable

144
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,980
and deterministic so think about it it

145
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,320
doesn't make sense

146
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,110
try and do something that machine

147
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:24,190
software can do faster more reliably and

148
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,860
that will always be correct so one

149
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,070
sample of this at gusto is a tool that

150
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,620
we use called danger it's a fantastic

151
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:36,909
open-source tool where I'm able to write

152
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:39,690
custom rules to look for basically

153
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,699
whatever I want and one example is if

154
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,950
someone touches a configuration file in

155
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,140
this case brakeman that it'll

156
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,270
automatically alert me so if they try to

157
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,949
be sneaky and add in an exception to

158
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,990
bypass one of the things that I've built

159
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:59,530
in I have like eyes on them so or if

160
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,080
they try to use a vulnerable function or

161
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,900
things that maybe seem kind of

162
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,760
suspicious then I'll be alerted as well

163
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,770
and this means that I won't have to go

164
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,830
through every single pull request I

165
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,699
won't have to go through every single

166
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,990
config file that I've set up

167
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:19,740
I have eyes basically on the entire code

168
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,140
base of the entire system so I can just

169
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,860
keep up on my email and then I have eyes

170
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:29,319
in nearly every place

171
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:33,339
it's actually leads well to my next

172
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,579
point is static code analysis so it's

173
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,620
useful because again this is not me

174
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:41,589
going through every single pull requests

175
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,579
this is a tool that I had implemented

176
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:47,139
and put into our CICU pipeline so

177
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,949
continuous integration can use

178
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:53,410
development as soon as a developer

179
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:56,550
pushes a pull request it'll run a whole

180
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:00,759
suite of tests and then one of them is

181
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:03,729
break man and and that's the tool of

182
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,350
choice that we use at ISO so by a show

183
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,730
of hands how many of you have used

184
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:14,920
Brickman or familiar with it so one and

185
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:19,480
a half haha cool so for those you who

186
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:22,930
are familiar Justin Collins over there

187
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,319
audience he is the author of brick man

188
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:30,069
and he's actually joining gusto which is

189
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:33,099
super super cool and this is cool but

190
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:37,000
also terrifying so super cool because I

191
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,850
got to learn from him and pick his brain

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,949
on just a whole bunch of static code

193
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,279
analysis things security things also

194
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:48,519
terrifying because now he can see how I

195
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,579
built up the thing the toilet he built

196
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,490
and how it integrated it so hopefully he

197
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:57,310
won't judge me too much depending on how

198
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,630
I did it but overall yet thrilled that

199
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,560
he's joining us though

200
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:07,060
and then also one thing I wanted to know

201
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:11,260
on this as well is that this provided

202
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,149
instant feedback for the engineers so as

203
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,660
soon as the pull request was created

204
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:18,850
they were not blocked on me to go over

205
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,959
their code to review to give it a thumbs

206
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,360
up so if this pass and then assuming the

207
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,589
other criteria were met as well they had

208
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,779
the full liberty to merge the code and

209
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:33,790
we get without me blocking them I was

210
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,639
able to empower them through this

211
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,430
mechanism which i think is pretty cool

212
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,770
and the next thing I want to go over

213
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,319
is vulnerable dependency management so

214
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:47,800
very much along the same lines of the

215
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,460
previous few slides about software and

216
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,649
code this is the idea just repeating

217
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,580
myself is that I don't need to have eyes

218
00:11:53,649 --> 00:12:03,550
on every single package every single

219
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:05,230
config this is the perfect way for the

220
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,520
engineers themselves to get instant

221
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,440
feedback if a package is outdated

222
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:16,270
they're going to receive a ping that

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,550
their team needs to update their their

224
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:22,770
gem their package or whatever else

225
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:27,069
they're using in this thing and then

226
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,720
github has a tool built-in called

227
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,970
dependable they bought it about a year

228
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,930
ago or so and that has been fantastic

229
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,120
because it creates pull requests

230
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,969
automatically it gets assigned to them

231
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:41,620
to the respective engineering teams and

232
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:44,290
then it's been a lifesaver saving a lot

233
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:49,000
of time on my end trying to coordinate

234
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:53,439
different things so now I want to move a

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,650
little bit further right down the whole

236
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:02,170
chain of development so pen testing I

237
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,550
think we have some mixed feelings on

238
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,449
this some people love it some people

239
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:09,250
don't love it

240
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:10,990
but whatever your stance is I think we

241
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,610
can probably all agree that it's not

242
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:18,400
available in in certain situations so at

243
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,760
a minimum I would say that you should be

244
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,620
running pen tests at least once ear

245
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,110
maybe even more if your budget allows

246
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,650
for it and so there are quite a few wins

247
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:32,250
that you get from this so from the first

248
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:37,170
one is that it's an easy compliance win

249
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:41,290
so when let's say your company wants to

250
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:43,569
create a partnership with a different

251
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:47,270
company a different partner and then

252
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,880
they want to send you a massive 28 page

253
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,370
rapport talking about your security

254
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,920
posture time on personal experience

255
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,390
those things are no fun to fill out and

256
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,689
if you have had to fill out some of

257
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,830
those things they suck so by being able

258
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,209
to pass along a pen test and

259
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:08,720
demonstrating your security posture to

260
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:11,839
these potential partners it saves you a

261
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,790
ton of time and then also give you some

262
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:20,029
baseline of how secure your product or

263
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,430
your application actually is and then

264
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,709
another thing which may not be super

265
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:28,120
obvious is that you can gather a lot of

266
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:32,899
data points around your security posture

267
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:37,100
so from year to year as you want to see

268
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:41,600
how much more secure getting we can see

269
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:44,300
how many critical high medium bones you

270
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,230
get and start to graph and benchmark

271
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:51,349
them and as we all know the execs upper

272
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,720
management love data and here are hard

273
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,839
data points where it's often difficult

274
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,600
at times to get our data for security

275
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,750
this is an easy one here's a few vendors

276
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:09,560
that we've had good good success with at

277
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:13,000
gusto and next again similar Japan

278
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:17,029
testing but I would argue different and

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,800
important as well is to run a bug bounty

280
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:25,070
program so this is something that I took

281
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,729
a lot of pride in trying to set up

282
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:31,370
trying to get their interests from the

283
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,829
different research community to have

284
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:38,060
them proactively hack on our gusto

285
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:41,060
platform so one of the benefits of this

286
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,540
is that I have hundreds of different

287
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,949
eyes perspectives methodologies active

288
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,569
hacking their platform 24/7 so I myself

289
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,610
also love to get down and dirty

290
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,320
fire up burp suite and start to poke

291
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,850
around hack stuff but again that's

292
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,550
probably not the best use of my time

293
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,340
again as the single engineer on a team

294
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,109
when there are a lot of other higher

295
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,750
as much as I would love to poke around

296
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,550
and try to find the next big fun

297
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,240
vulnerability I'm gonna leave it to

298
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,359
others who have it as their sole

299
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,990
dedicated mission to find

300
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,170
vulnerabilities on our platform again so

301
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,030
this is a continuously monitored thing

302
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,680
so I don't have to worry button goes

303
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,420
even night and the wake up inbox if I

304
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,120
see some things I just great that's work

305
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:33,130
that I didn't have to do was able to

306
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,360
empower and pay others to do for me so

307
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:38,480
those were some of the technical ones

308
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,890
now I want to move into the cultural

309
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,180
side I think this is often overlooked in

310
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:48,740
our industry and something that I'm

311
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,209
practically trying to change again with

312
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,880
this talk right here and even as a talk

313
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,770
with different friends colleagues and

314
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,770
different people in this industry I want

315
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:02,150
to advocate that sure it's great you can

316
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:04,460
be as technical as smart as you want to

317
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:09,710
be but if you don't have people on your

318
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:12,890
side then you're powerless so with that

319
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:15,350
being said these were some of the

320
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:21,830
departments that I partner with closely

321
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:25,280
at custom so this is just a snapshot of

322
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,629
what or who I partner with but again

323
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,369
this may look very different your

324
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,780
company I just want to go over some of

325
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:36,889
the reasons why I chose these six teams

326
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:39,800
to closely partner with so the first one

327
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:43,280
is IT and I like to think of them as

328
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,820
frontline security so when something

329
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,610
goes wrong on the employees computer

330
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:53,629
they oftentimes go to the IT Help Desk

331
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:56,990
or the IT team or engineer asking why

332
00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:01,520
can i login what's this do a push what's

333
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:05,570
this random thing showing up they get a

334
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,300
ton of the requests from the everyday

335
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:11,389
employee so by working with them and

336
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,090
having ITP actually past law anything

337
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:17,630
that may be suspicious

338
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,699
up to security that was a huge win so

339
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:24,529
the IT team was quite a bit larger than

340
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:29,029
just myself so that again was skilling

341
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:32,690
myself procced that compliance this was

342
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:35,419
an interesting team because we are in an

343
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:39,320
industry with a lot of regulations with

344
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:41,630
what data we hold with PII and pH I then

345
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,760
we're constantly running into different

346
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,130
situations where we need to ensure that

347
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,460
we're fully compliant with the different

348
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,710
rules to effectively yeah not be in

349
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,360
trouble so I had to work closely with

350
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,460
compliance to ensure everything that we

351
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,879
were doing from a security engineering

352
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:03,320
standpoint was approved and was given

353
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:07,100
the thumbs up by them and the next group

354
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,740
of individuals which may not be a media

355
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,080
at first obvious efforts is are the

356
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,840
product managers so these are the group

357
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,168
of individuals that are coming up with

358
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:22,070
the features at the very very beginning

359
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:25,490
at the ideation phase so when they want

360
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:28,760
to create this brand new feature for

361
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,049
this may be fancy new login it's not the

362
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,929
engineering team that's coming up with

363
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:35,870
it it's the PM's that are coming up with

364
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:39,200
it so by me having a close partnership

365
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,939
with them by me having my name in their

366
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,640
whole document where they fill it out

367
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,179
and they know that if anything touches

368
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,330
securely remotely so anything with

369
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:52,340
authorization such as management

370
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,428
authentication and great new API

371
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:58,340
anything that may touch or jeopardize

372
00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:01,970
our security then they are already aware

373
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,158
and are happy to loop me in which was a

374
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,440
huge win you're not having to go through

375
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,789
and comb through every single part of

376
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,580
sheet that they create

377
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:15,679
I get pinged on only the relevant ones

378
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:17,899
and then legal I think there is a super

379
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,360
common goal for both of us is to

380
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:24,709
mitigate and reduce risk for the company

381
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,219
so by me partnering with legal by me

382
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,549
chatting with them and

383
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:33,809
them having that tight-knit partnership

384
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:36,000
then I have eyes on a whole bunch of

385
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:39,809
other things that I wouldn't get access

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,600
to normally the next one hope is pretty

387
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:45,350
obvious are the developers or the

388
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,408
engineering team and then these are the

389
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:53,070
folks who are writing the code who are

390
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:57,360
building all the features that are and

391
00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:00,230
customers use so by having them trust me

392
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,289
and to build that rapport that's been

393
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:07,230
invaluable having them know that hey I'm

394
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:09,960
here for you my goal is to not block you

395
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,990
it's not slowed you down but I want to

396
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,710
empower you so one thing that awesome I

397
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,090
could tell the engineers is actually how

398
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,509
many of you are familiar with Rainbow

399
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:25,379
Road and Mario Kart there we go okay I

400
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:29,429
got a few more hands this time so I like

401
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:32,309
to say that you all like the engineers

402
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:33,960
are the drivers on the Rainbow Road that

403
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:36,299
they're going as fast as possible it's a

404
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,720
really tricky situation they want to

405
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:44,158
just go fast fast fast but then I'm the

406
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,559
ones putting guardrails on the track so

407
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,629
that if they bump into it they can't

408
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,600
fall off that they're going to still

409
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:52,889
ship features as fast as possible but

410
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,590
I'm going to place these girls for them

411
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:57,389
do it as fast and securely as possible

412
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,559
and that's honestly my job so the

413
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:59,758
guardrails dome down

414
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,610
they just keep them in their own lane

415
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:08,730
and keep them safe and finally

416
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:10,830
infrastructure if your ec2 instance

417
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,480
already is not configured properly then

418
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:16,019
you have much bigger problems than some

419
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,720
tiny XSS vulnerability so having a close

420
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:20,970
partnership with infrastructure knowing

421
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,289
that they have your back from what

422
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,509
you're trying to secure in the web app

423
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:27,360
that like the whole platform and the

424
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:30,090
base is already secured upon that should

425
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,879
give you a great peace of mind knowing

426
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,379
that the base image is up-to-date and

427
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:37,049
all the bones have been patched and you

428
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:41,658
can slowly focus on the layer seven and

429
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,658
six and down is you can leave to them

430
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:49,530
so how many of you have seen this image

431
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:52,080
okay got some more hands there too so

432
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:55,889
oftentimes I feel like when people ask

433
00:22:52,080 --> 00:23:01,679
us how are we doing a very common

434
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:03,420
response is fine good okay and I'm gonna

435
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,800
advocate that this is absolutely not the

436
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,250
right response that we should be saying

437
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:12,030
as security professionals that we should

438
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:16,710
not be saying that yes life is okay life

439
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:18,480
is going life is great and in fact I

440
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,060
don't think we're being truthful when we

441
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,030
say that because as all of you probably

442
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:26,100
have seen that again we have a lot of

443
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,910
work to do a lot of changing priorities

444
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,879
and trying to balance a thousand

445
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,670
different things so I'm trying to

446
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,210
advocate that we be more authentic with

447
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:42,750
the different engineers the different

448
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:45,090
teams people that we interact with so be

449
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,940
open and showed them the pen test

450
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:51,570
reports show them the bug money reports

451
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,960
show them things that that might be

452
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,060
broken

453
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,680
I know it's may be a little bit scary to

454
00:23:54,060 --> 00:24:00,419
be vulnerable to be transparent but from

455
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,600
what I've seen from my experience is

456
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:07,740
that once you have them on your team

457
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,110
once they're pro security that is so

458
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,430
powerful is that they actively want to

459
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:16,050
help because I don't think there's

460
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:18,060
anyone who actively wants to not do

461
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,950
security maybe it's not a top of their

462
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,649
mind but once they realize that what

463
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,410
they're working towards is for the

464
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:28,260
greater good company I think they're

465
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:31,290
just all and they want to do it once you

466
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:35,840
get them to buy into your mission and

467
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,840
vision of holistic security

468
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:46,180
the next thing I'll talk about is to be

469
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:48,550
accessible so be open and be willing to

470
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:52,360
help others and there are a few reasons

471
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:57,790
for this so the first one is just the

472
00:24:52,360 --> 00:25:02,560
right thing to do oftentimes security

473
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:06,399
might be seen as this scary amorphous

474
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,590
random team off in the corner but

475
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,560
honestly there's no reason why security

476
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:14,350
shouldn't be like a friendly presence

477
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,179
and the company people should know who

478
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:22,330
security is and what the team does and

479
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:25,150
secondly it's because whether you like

480
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:27,820
to admit or not you're most likely as in

481
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:32,710
you will need to ask a favor from

482
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:35,679
different teams so through this again as

483
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,660
the only engineer I oftentimes would eat

484
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,610
lunch with nearly every team so it

485
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,250
bounced from table a table trying to

486
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:44,379
make friends to chat with them to see

487
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:49,420
how their day was how the weekend was

488
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:51,460
and sure it was a lot of effort to get

489
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,760
around every single team every single

490
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,580
person but yeah and now they knew my

491
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,530
face they knew who I was in office so

492
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,530
that in itself was pretty powerful I

493
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:06,300
want to share another story with you so

494
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:11,170
there was one member of our legal team

495
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,909
who had an issue with their 2fa on their

496
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,100
personal account I think it was for some

497
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:18,610
banking app and they were having some

498
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:21,580
issues trying to set up to scan the QR

499
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,250
code to set up the token and then this

500
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,830
person asked me for help again so very

501
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,960
outside of my job responsibilities so

502
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,389
this is their personal 2fa on a banking

503
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,460
app but they just didn't know how to do

504
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:36,310
it and they want some help so I sat down

505
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,070
things spend 10 minutes figured out some

506
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,020
of the things and they were super

507
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,470
grateful and as it turned out I think

508
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:47,320
supposed six months later I need a huge

509
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:50,500
huge favor I had to push a contract

510
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,679
through for one of our vendors and then

511
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,510
I

512
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,790
like past the deadline a little bit from

513
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:57,280
like that's the way that they give I was

514
00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:00,010
like walking to them like can I ask you

515
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,680
a big favor and they were actually super

516
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:05,020
open to it because I built the initial

517
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:09,160
rapport with them so they had no issue

518
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:13,180
with kind of fast tracking me which yeah

519
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:16,300
I was eternally grateful for so odd to

520
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:18,730
think of what we do in a sense are

521
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,850
different transactions as kind of like

522
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:24,420
working like a bank so when we are

523
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,790
accessible when we tried to help others

524
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,950
maybe not at responsibility we are

525
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,520
effectively making a lot of deposits in

526
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:36,670
the goodwill bank and then more often

527
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:42,180
times than not we're gonna need to take

528
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:45,460
a chunk out and to withdraw some

529
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:48,190
goodwill and to ask for a big favor so

530
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,800
by putting in the work at the beginning

531
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,980
then you have a whole bunch of favors

532
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,460
ready to go and that itself helped me a

533
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,460
time

534
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:08,320
so next thing I want to go over is

535
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:11,619
security education for this portion it

536
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,908
was important again to get my face out

537
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:17,908
to the rest of the company as a single

538
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:20,979
person with a company that's

539
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:24,489
ever-growing hiring a ton of people how

540
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:27,459
could I maximize my single time or my

541
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:31,330
single person and my time to a whole

542
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:34,959
audience so the answer to that question

543
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:38,668
was to do several types of training so

544
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:43,749
when and when employees were on boarded

545
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:47,109
to join us so they go through a about 30

546
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:49,179
to 45 minute security onboarding

547
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:54,718
training where we go over some basic

548
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:58,570
basic things like fishing - if a

549
00:28:54,719 --> 00:29:01,179
password managers or just like simple

550
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:04,779
things that we might be for in ta'dibi

551
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:07,029
able to spend some time advocating for

552
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,289
security at the very forefront like when

553
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:11,200
they join the company

554
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:13,899
that in itself they already knew what to

555
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,999
do and more importantly they knew who to

556
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:19,988
contact so it was a ping you know slack

557
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:21,700
or - email security act and then to add

558
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:24,719
on top of that we also had a specific

559
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,729
engineering training that I built for

560
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:31,599
the engineers joining us so so then this

561
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:36,549
was a super security 101 high level

562
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:41,229
overview of what we do or what I do for

563
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:42,700
the engineering teams in terms of going

564
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:46,629
over different tools we use in our

565
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:49,989
pipelines different vulnerabilities that

566
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:52,089
we've seen in the past how we develop

567
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:54,369
software security through our SDLC and

568
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:57,099
just like really basic things so my goal

569
00:29:54,369 --> 00:30:00,309
through this was not to teach them how

570
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:02,439
to mitigate every single type of XSS

571
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:06,219
vulnerability under the Sun or how to

572
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:11,559
build some crazy to a faith flow but

573
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:14,260
rather it was for me to put a name to a

574
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,399
face so again when I

575
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,500
had to work with them on a polar class

576
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,630
or to build a feature that that was not

577
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,050
the first time that I was interacting

578
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:28,240
with them so I think as a lot of you

579
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:31,050
have a ton of meetings on your calendars

580
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,910
every single day I myself also have

581
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:36,790
booked basically every day with meetings

582
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:39,720
and I can honestly say that doing the

583
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:42,520
security 101 training was one of my

584
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,890
probably the only meeting every two

585
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,460
weeks that I really did enjoy so getting

586
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:50,530
a chance to work with the engineers to

587
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,300
meet them even more importantly

588
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,450
especially we have a few different

589
00:30:52,300 --> 00:31:00,250
offices across the country to know that

590
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:05,320
hey I'm here for you let me know what I

591
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:06,550
can do to work with and support you in

592
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,790
any way possible

593
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:12,879
and then one more thing wanted to add on

594
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:15,879
to this is that we occasionally ran and

595
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,610
do run phishing campaigns and the

596
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,400
purpose of this is to in no way shame

597
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,469
anyone who does click on a link or

598
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:30,940
submit some information rather it's to

599
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:32,890
show them that hey security is the most

600
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,890
importance and that people are actually

601
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:40,180
out there trying to attack and vicious

602
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:43,590
it's the idea of creating awareness and

603
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:46,210
showing that even though you may be some

604
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:49,149
new grad who just started on a sales

605
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:51,780
team you may seem unimportant but in

606
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,710
fact that you have a ton of power

607
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:57,629
yourself with what systems you have

608
00:31:53,710 --> 00:32:01,120
access to and that we have to be

609
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:03,820
collectively conscious of security as an

610
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,139
entire company so that has had a few

611
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,379
different wins that worked out really

612
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,380
well

613
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:16,570
so what happens when all these things go

614
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,130
right what happens when you

615
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:22,129
exponentially skill yourself through

616
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:26,030
technical and cultural strategies and

617
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:27,650
what does success look like so now I

618
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,200
want to share a few screenshots of

619
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:34,730
different interactions I've had with

620
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:37,310
various colleagues at work so what this

621
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:42,470
first one right here is one of my

622
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:47,179
favorite engineers as you can see he

623
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:48,890
found access to a system that people

624
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:53,090
definitely should not have had access to

625
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:56,360
and indeed this was quite concerning so

626
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:59,659
somehow his engineer's stumbled upon it

627
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,340
found it I sent it over to me this was a

628
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,290
fantastic we find something that would

629
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,980
not have poked into because this was a

630
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,540
system that this engineer uses every

631
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:14,680
single day and had a lot of film the

632
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:18,080
familiarity with and he indeed has found

633
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:20,290
numerous other fun little things like

634
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,290
that

635
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:30,110
the next screenshot shows someone in our

636
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:32,660
in a non engineering function so this

637
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:38,270
person also has sent quite a few emails

638
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:40,460
over to myself and has shown that they

639
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:44,090
indeed do care a lot about security and

640
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:47,840
phishing emails and even though they are

641
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:51,110
no way a technical security person

642
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,300
they're very much aware of implications

643
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,699
of phishing given all the trainings

644
00:33:53,300 --> 00:34:00,879
given the different interactions I've

645
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:03,470
had so by knowing that I have eyes on

646
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,610
emails that I don't even receive makes

647
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,000
it a lot easier to sleep at night

648
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:11,839
knowing that the company does indeed

649
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,230
care about security and what things they

650
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,530
do receive the inbox and to be cautious

651
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,760
of what actions

652
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:23,040
they can and can't take and this might

653
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:29,340
be one of my favorite interactions had

654
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:33,600
with one of the engineers here so I come

655
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:36,450
in to work I'm 24 and I'm not sure how

656
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,668
it isn't here in Austin but a lot of the

657
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:42,600
culture in San Francisco said people

658
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:45,389
rolling like 10:00 10:30 11:00 so I

659
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:55,199
think this made like a 10:30 ish day for

660
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:57,299
me and seeing this message was both sad

661
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,410
and that we did have some reports come

662
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,500
in but also made me really really happy

663
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:06,330
because this engineer took the time to

664
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,120
proactively go through the port's that

665
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:11,310
came in I gave them access to the hacker

666
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,819
1 platform to look through the different

667
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:18,299
reports and the best part of this story

668
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:22,020
is that I had to pull requests ready to

669
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:26,670
go in the afternoon with fixes for this

670
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:28,350
so even though I didn't get a chance to

671
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,280
actually go through the reports to get

672
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:34,350
them through it didn't go through all

673
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:38,130
details this engineer took security to

674
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:43,620
Hart and proactively reached out about

675
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:47,400
this and pushed out to fixes so if I

676
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:49,500
don't know like what more I could ask

677
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,350
for after partnering with the

678
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,410
engineering team getting them to love

679
00:35:52,350 --> 00:36:00,900
and truly care about security I mean

680
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:02,940
that's what I have been trying to do for

681
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,490
the past couple of years and this was a

682
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:09,260
culmination of a lot of efforts paying

683
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,259
off and I felt really really good

684
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:24,400
so we went over a lot of things and as

685
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:27,000
you can see it's not easy to get a team

686
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,940
get the entire company to care about

687
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,590
security and what it actually looks like

688
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,430
in an everyday

689
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:38,890
changing environment but I think by

690
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:43,060
using a mix of technical and cultural

691
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:46,270
strategies that it's honestly doable to

692
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,730
evoke a security engine company to get

693
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,770
engineers and non engineers like to

694
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:54,670
rally together and build something

695
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:58,540
special so just to summarize some of the

696
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:02,920
things the first one is to always be

697
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:06,009
coding ABC to have static code analysis

698
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:11,320
to work through vulnerability dependency

699
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:14,320
management to have pen testing going on

700
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:18,520
to have also run a bug bunny program and

701
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:21,460
then from a cultural side is to build

702
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:24,600
key relationships with different teams

703
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:30,730
that you want to partner with it's

704
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:34,569
important to be accessible to be open to

705
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:38,190
be transparent and then to have security

706
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:41,020
education for all the different

707
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:44,590
engineers and and non engineers alike at

708
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:48,580
your company so now I want to go back to

709
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,900
one of my first slides so despite being

710
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,600
outnumbered

711
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:55,390
despite have ever-changing priorities

712
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,380
and despite just being an Icee without a

713
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,859
fancy title

714
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:02,440
I was pretty powerful and I did a lot of

715
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:05,680
things and like not to brag but this is

716
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,700
to show you that if you're in a similar

717
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,960
role that it very much is doable and

718
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,960
obviously these changes don't happen

719
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,840
overnight it took a lot of work trying

720
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,940
to partner it with the different

721
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,600
cross-functional teams to get them to

722
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,260
bind this whole idea a mission of

723
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,630
working

724
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,970
for working together to create a more

725
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:31,480
secure environment definitely not easy

726
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:33,250
but when you see all this work as I

727
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,760
showed you in some of the screen shots

728
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:41,560
from slack it's a fantastic feeling

729
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,890
again so if any of you like are in a

730
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:48,070
similar position don't give it hope like

731
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:51,368
it definitely is possible through a lot

732
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,380
of work to get your team members the

733
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:56,770
other company to truly care about

734
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:59,800
security so as I started to wrap up I

735
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,910
like to thank flea and Ricky for helping

736
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,760
me with this presentation they were

737
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:06,640
fantastic in editing and supporting me

738
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,940
with the whole process and both are

739
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,890
honestly amazing individuals I've had a

740
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:16,869
chance to work with and learn from them

741
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:19,359
and they've working a company that cares

742
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:22,420
a lot security seems interesting to work

743
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,759
with people like Justin then guusto is

744
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,859
hiring for all security roles so if

745
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,410
interested you should definitely hit me

746
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:32,619
up and we'll chat afterwards and I like

747
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:35,649
to leave you with one last quote to

748
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:40,210
summarize this entire thing is that

749
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:42,850
relying solely on a title to influence

750
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:46,030
is a problem that positional power does

751
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:50,230
not solve but rather true power comes

752
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:53,050
from a desire to solve to understand and

753
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:56,590
solve challenges with software and

754
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:58,300
people so I assume in your startup so

755
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,670
you must have lots of remote employees

756
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:05,080
right so what's right do you have lots

757
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:09,220
of remote employees we do have a few of

758
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:11,560
them but I'd say 95% are based in our

759
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,850
own office I wasn't gonna ask you

760
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,070
mentioned about building key

761
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,589
relationship with different Garmin yeah

762
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,060
if four more employees how was it going

763
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,160
how we wanted to do it you know

764
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,790
absolutely a great question so I think

765
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:28,839
fortunately for us the people who were

766
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:31,359
remote often came into the office about

767
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,970
once a quarter or so so then I would

768
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,500
actively reach out to them if I knew

769
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,730
that they were coming into office just

770
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,790
to catch up and

771
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:41,980
say hi to keep some eyes that have a new

772
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,870
remote engineers or whoever was coming

773
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,700
in and I know that's not always the case

774
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:48,310
for different companies that they are

775
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,919
sometimes fully remote but I was yet in

776
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:53,320
great position where they did come and

777
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,850
once a quarter and I would take the time

778
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,350
just to go for a walk or grab a coffee

779
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:58,299
with them and that's how I build

780
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:02,040
relationship by keeping eyes on who was

781
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,040
coming into the office who was remote

782
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:13,259
what keeps you up at night a lot of

783
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:16,299
things what do you think about at night

784
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:25,320
back then or now those are probably two

785
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:31,090
different answers yeah yeah so early on

786
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:33,190
was I would say some of the human

787
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:37,150
components of security so the phishing

788
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:39,670
emails by them installing super sketchy

789
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,620
random packages on the computer

790
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:44,290
different extensions that gave them full

791
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,310
access to the entire Dom to do whatever

792
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:53,020
they wanted with whatever data and I

793
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:54,700
don't know if I fully realize again at

794
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,240
the very beginning how important was to

795
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:01,750
communicate and evangelize security so

796
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,669
the very very beginning I was like heads

797
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:06,070
down on the technical portion trying to

798
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,770
build all the software that I could but

799
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:12,340
taking a step back and realizing that

800
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:14,770
the biggest risks were coming with the

801
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,750
human side and not that I wanted to get

802
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,660
ashame them in any way but just show

803
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:22,030
them that hey I'm here for you and let

804
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,109
me see how I can actually put up those

805
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,570
guardrails for you

806
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:27,460
so if they were to install some sketchy

807
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:30,160
package that I would put up the

808
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,110
guardrails but again to know in the best

809
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,120
case to not install in the first place

810
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:36,130
yeah so it's kind of working with the

811
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:41,520
human side which can the other night in

812
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:41,520
the beginning there we go

813
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:53,940
hi-hi earlier you mentioned that you use

814
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:57,359
cultural tools to address you know

815
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,520
security concerns and am I am interested

816
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,020
in in these cultural tools that I don't

817
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,490
know you can provide me example provide

818
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:09,150
us examples as a human human factor it's

819
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:12,240
in my opinion quite relevant in security

820
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,920
yeah yeah yes I think if I said cultural

821
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,720
tool I apologize I meant more of the

822
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,400
cultural strategies I don't know if

823
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,970
there are tools per se that can make

824
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,240
force someone to do something again even

825
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:27,149
if I did have power like as a CSO or

826
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,799
director of security I can't force you

827
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,020
to really do anything other than like I

828
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,599
guess firing you so it's more about

829
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,940
trying to build these soft skills and

830
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:41,550
working with the different individuals

831
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:44,700
to show that security is not maybe like

832
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:48,780
has been seen in the past as a blocker

833
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:51,750
as attempting to slow people down that

834
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,359
was I would say is the biggest tool in a

835
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:57,410
sense is to remove that barrier by

836
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,210
showing that there's an open clear

837
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,670
channel of communication between whoever

838
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:06,599
wants to chat with me or the security

839
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:09,930
