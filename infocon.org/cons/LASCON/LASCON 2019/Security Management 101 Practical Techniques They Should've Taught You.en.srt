00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,850
get to later I don't answer it please

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,350
speak up this is what we'll talk about

22
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,520
very quickly because we're gonna get to

23
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,298
each of these but this is just my

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:36,140
outline the first few things there and

25
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:38,600
then here in the next few things will

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,700
finish up I do have I have not yet

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,619
posted the slides but I will so if

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,400
you're not a furious note-taker don't

29
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,799
worry about it

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,380
I'm gonna keep the link at the end I'm

31
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,510
also going to mention books the most

32
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,298
prominent of which are these - these are

33
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:57,110
your copies to give away my own copies

34
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:58,520
are back here okay so hopefully we'll

35
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,990
find a way or a reason I realized

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,089
there's too many I do not have a book

37
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:05,839
for everybody so maybe we can figure out

38
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,580
a way to negotiate against the books but

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,619
I'll be needing a few more than just

40
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,540
those two I also have that list at the

41
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,280
end of the slides as well so also if

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,790
you're not furious nomes eager there or

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,220
you don't have a fantastic memory and

44
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,510
don't worry buddy so let's start with

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,450
with why

46
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,790
they like speakers articulates that the

47
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,159
reasons for starting with why in this

48
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,379
quote is if you've not seen something

49
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,540
simon Sinek presenting is a very very

50
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,459
popular famous TED talk you can find it

51
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,048
easily on YouTube he's written a number

52
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,610
of books the most recent of which just

53
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:43,830
came out infinity but the reason that

54
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,739
I'm doing this there's a few reasons but

55
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,549
one because there's a dearth of

56
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,530
management and leadership training and

57
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,480
information streams specifically there

58
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,459
is some management training if you've

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,970
looked around for it your company may

60
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,400
have

61
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,440
mayhaps you have management training but

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,790
very few security folks tend to get up

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,500
and talk about what it means to be an

64
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,910
effective leader what it means to be an

65
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,489
effective manager or not believe they're

66
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,620
more than just me but but that's why

67
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,329
that's one thing that's important you

68
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,799
know the other reason why it's important

69
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,470
for me to get up here and talk about it

70
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,079
is because I want you all to know how

71
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,970
important it is in security to have

72
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,440
looks like people meeting folks we're

73
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,000
interested in being a leader folks who

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,760
are moved by being a leader so let me

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,280
tell you a little bit about why I do I

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,989
do I'm thinking of three people in my

77
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,069
head right now none of them are in the

78
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,500
room so they don't have to be

79
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,119
embarrassed but three people have

80
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,769
affected as a manager in none of whom

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,109
are working for me right now that they

82
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,319
have for me in the past in previous

83
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:41,430
roles one is a very outgoing x-ray

84
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,119
detection hundred-person

85
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,849
and really needed guidance in terms of

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,099
how to be a leader and a manager he

87
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,138
wanted to grow he wanted to progress in

88
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,090
his career he wanted to lead people that

89
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,480
felt very uncomfortable doing so and

90
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,690
felt very ill equipped to do so it turns

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,608
out it wasn't it was very ready for it

92
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,629
but really needed the encouragement and

93
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,910
the inspiration to lead a team of people

94
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:10,798
another person I have in my head

95
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:14,370
fantastic contributor very very smart

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:19,440
and sharp person in terms of security

97
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:21,449
practice practice practice but lacked

98
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,550
exceed let's say some social graces or

99
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,720
some of those soft skills like books

100
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,570
tend to say and needed some coaching

101
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,610
in that sense and to grow into becoming

102
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,950
a manager from being a contributor and I

103
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,650
really think fondly when I think of that

104
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,800
person in terms of how much he has grown

105
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,870
as a leader and I had some small part to

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,670
play in that and the final third person

107
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,130
I think of when I think of what it means

108
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,370
to to lead people what needs to be an

109
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:51,580
effective manager and what results I

110
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:53,410
have seen in my own career I was leading

111
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,770
it all to go to another one and this

112
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:59,590
person who is gruff and sarcastic and

113
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,810
cynical and paranoid like every good

114
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,669
secretary security practitioner super

115
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,400
great at one who does probably just like

116
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,860
every single one of you on on the next

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,380
to last day maybe even though they've

118
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,700
been I last day in this role came up to

119
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,440
me in my office and now I'm not going to

120
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,000
tell you who this person is because it

121
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,630
may turn out to be embarrassing this

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,340
person but he cried it was very moving

123
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,130
to you it was very moving to me he cried

124
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,619
because of the effect I have had on him

125
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:33,280
as a manager and I'm sharing these

126
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,919
things not to not to you know talent or

127
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,840
boast but to share that this can be your

128
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,620
experience as well hopefully some of you

129
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,479
have experienced moving and powerful

130
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,270
moments as a manager is a leader if you

131
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,880
haven't yet I hope that your that your

132
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,710
goal or your objective of one of the

133
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,530
things you're trying to do is not just

134
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,510
to get good results not just to retain

135
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,640
people on your team not just to grow

136
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,390
your fiefdom or your sphere of influence

137
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:04,719
or your your empire but to move people

138
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,370
to inspire people to do something and to

139
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,040
get something done so that's why I'm

140
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,440
here I learn more of you feel bad if you

141
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,780
haven't yet and I hope that that's part

142
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,490
of why you're here as well in terms of

143
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,469
the second piece are you ready

144
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,570
I shall I have this up here to challenge

145
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,710
you to challenge me that there really

146
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,390
are no pre but because it the

147
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,070
prerequisites to management there

148
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,740
there's no degree there's no

149
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,860
certification it does help to be trained

150
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,650
I think but but there's nothing that you

151
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,690
need to go into a training or if some

152
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,429
experience you have to have had there

153
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,020
are managers who come out of school and

154
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,520
it can be effective managers there are

155
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,320
folks who've been contributors for

156
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,909
decades and can transition into

157
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,320
management there's nothing that's

158
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,169
prevented you from transitioning into

159
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,430
management today and there's nothing I

160
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:52,750
think that should be holding me back

161
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:55,210
okay in terms of another reason why I

162
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,150
have this year where I live I'm doing

163
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,530
this training and this presentation good

164
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,929
I also do a training about this kind of

165
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,169
stuff a full-day training that I did a

166
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,660
few days ago for some folks the reason

167
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:10,210
why I have this here is because some

168
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,190
folks feel very ill equipped to jump

169
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,870
into a management role because there's

170
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,390
no training program available today I

171
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,820
mentioned at the outset some enterprises

172
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,469
some large companies have massive very

173
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,780
more efficient and effective training

174
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,880
programs for all of their vendors that

175
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,349
may or may not be a place you may not

176
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,940
have that available to you I'll mention

177
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:31,300
some resources that you can take

178
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:35,200
advantage of some paid some free okay

179
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,270
but it's okay if you don't have a

180
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,950
corporate training program it's okay if

181
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,289
you haven't been trained as an integer

182
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:45,490
DESFire to throw it into a roll like

183
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:46,900
that this is another thing that I want

184
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,729
to speak to briefly and then move right

185
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,450
along I'm not going to spend time the

186
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:54,520
timeline but there are there are lots of

187
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,380
folks that tend to challenge the idea of

188
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,570
I want to be a leader not a manager and

189
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,370
I would challenge right back those folks

190
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,530
and if that's your mindset then that

191
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,229
management is negative leadership is

192
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,270
positive strike that from from from your

193
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:09,340
vocabulary because both can be positive

194
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,409
and both can be negative as we have all

195
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,359
experienced I'm sure you can be working

196
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,460
for very cooler and very ineffective

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,590
leaders you can be working for very poor

198
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,570
and effective managers and the bite and

199
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,700
the and the opposite is absolutely true

200
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,080
so these are not equivalent these are

201
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,690
not

202
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,639
a manager is someone with direct reports

203
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,680
who can hire and fire ok does

204
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,150
responsibility for performance

205
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,650
management and assessment and things

206
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,848
like that there's some very specific

207
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,039
things that go into a definition of a

208
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:47,880
manager but a leader is someone who has

209
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:50,010
followers that's all yeah not

210
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,779
necessarily I think in terms of the

211
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,269
effective practices which we're about to

212
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,029
talk about in terms of this kind of 101

213
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:59,579
introductory coverage the practices of

214
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,430
the same so the practices I'm about to

215
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:04,469
describe work the same if you're a teeny

216
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,510
eater they work if you're a manager with

217
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,180
that title they work if you're a manager

218
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,010
in name only but not title or not even

219
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,149
in responsibility but they weren't they

220
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,170
work they work they're the same

221
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:18,209
practices for everybody so what is an

222
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,180
effective manager an effective manager

223
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:23,699
is someone who gets results and someone

224
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,739
who retains their people so that comes

225
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,329
from this book the first of the

226
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:33,209
recommendations by Mark Horseman the

227
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:35,010
effective manager in on page page for

228
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,869
the definition of effective manager is

229
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,480
when one gets results and keeps her cool

230
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,459
I will explain that but that's that's

231
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,130
what we mean by an effective manager not

232
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,180
just a manager and then what do you mean

233
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,089
by being effective

234
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,189
well being effective is doing the right

235
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,320
things so you may have heard efficiency

236
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,660
and effectiveness these are two words

237
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,190
that have specific definitions

238
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,620
efficiency is doing things were right

239
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:03,000
we're doing things well but infected

240
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,670
this is doing the right things so that's

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,410
why this is about effectiveness because

242
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,689
you can be efficient and be doing the

243
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,430
wrong stuff you can be building the

244
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,140
wrong widget very efficient and very

245
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,089
good at it but building the wrong widget

246
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,160
okay so we want to make sure they're

247
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:19,860
doing the right stuff and that's what

248
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,630
this is about okay so speaking out let's

249
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,010
jump right into it in terms of what

250
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,170
those things are I'm going to give you

251
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,060
the ten essential practices in just a

252
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,810
second and then there's slider to but

253
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,540
that's what

254
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,000
for the rest of the presentation I

255
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,949
wouldn't be quoting a number of people

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,600
but most prominently Peter Drucker

257
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,360
during this presentation if you've not

258
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,830
found a Peter Drucker that's the other

259
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:45,779
book here Drucker Road like another 60

260
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,750
80 books something like that in his

261
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:50,760
lifetime to an 80 count way too many to

262
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,339
recommend but probably the most powerful

263
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,589
in my TV is this one right here the

264
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,060
effective executive and it's just the

265
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,500
title is deceptive if you don't know

266
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,010
what he's talking about this book was

267
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,580
written about 53 years ago okay so not

268
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,950
yesterday and an executive by Drucker's

269
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,600
definition is and is essentially a

270
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,279
knowledge worker and if you're not

271
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,170
familiar with the term he coined the

272
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,620
term knowledge worker about 60 some-odd

273
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:19,560
years ago 60 years ago way before

274
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,320
computers you all are knowledge workers

275
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:26,130
by his definition so you all by this

276
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:32,580
definition are executives that's enough

277
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:34,140
about this management 101 and the 10

278
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,860
essential practices which are in another

279
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,560
slide are all coming from four critical

280
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,990
behaviors that are talked about in this

281
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,770
book the effective manager before

282
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,450
covered in depth and then five practices

283
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,400
for effectiveness which are all covered

284
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,620
in depth here in drug report

285
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,810
so one translation of what have you said

286
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,310
is no original ideas in this

287
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:01,890
presentation it is one right we're not

288
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,329
not 201 without 301 this is this is the

289
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,330
basic stuff for effectiveness as the

290
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,890
manager and again it's just not out

291
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,940
there for everybody so I'm trying to

292
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,699
make it a little bit more prominent

293
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,560
please so again essential practice let's

294
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,310
list them out we've already started with

295
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,890
the first one

296
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:20,069
start with why and what must be done in

297
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,990
other words effectiveness okay so we'll

298
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,970
get into number two three four and five

299
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,779
in a second one-on-ones

300
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:30,980
talk about performance do coaching

301
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:36,620
delegate work set goals and execute

302
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,620
those the first five is we be into

303
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:47,500
and then six track time seven

304
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:50,839
communicate effectively decision-making

305
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,689
with business driven mindset strengths

306
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,430
focus on strengths be healthy and then

307
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:58,250
of course there's no such thing as a top

308
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,449
ten about bonus practices so journal and

309
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,029
reflected read and we'll talk about

310
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:07,149
these at the end those were somewhat

311
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:11,000
obvious things max was yeah so much for

312
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:19,430
that so let's talk about practice number

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,779
two so who to everybody I'm assuming has

314
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,989
a manager maybe you don't because you

315
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,459
work for yourself but do you do do you

316
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,110
have weekly one-on-ones if you're a

317
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:31,310
manager do you participate in weekly

318
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:32,810
one-on-one okay interesting great swim

319
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,378
evenly down really deeper than what this

320
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,709
is

321
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:38,509
so one once is the practice the

322
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,969
essential first essential practice of

323
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:43,370
any effective manager what I want to

324
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,410
emphasize though is not just a one on

325
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,800
one piece but the weekly and with every

326
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,860
direct report the review part of the

327
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,060
reason why we need to get to know people

328
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,550
what are the reason why we're getting to

329
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,138
know our people up here which is the

330
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,709
first group of behavior of an effective

331
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,240
manager is to know who they are what

332
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,469
they're looking for what they need to be

333
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,630
doing how they need to be growing

334
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,699
whether they're being whether they are

335
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,810
challenged whether the role is right for

336
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:10,910
them all that kind of stuff

337
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,920
so the best way to figure that out is to

338
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:17,660
meet with them one-on-one and regularly

339
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:20,420
talk about ok and this concept is coming

340
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,889
from a book called first break all the

341
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,279
rules by the Gallup organizations

342
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:28,040
published maybe 2025 years ago based on

343
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,300
their research into what it meant to be

344
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,219
you've heard of employee engagement

345
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,660
servants you heard of employee

346
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,509
engagement survey yellow heads nodding

347
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,300
so that came from the Gallup research 20

348
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:39,800
25 30 years ago okay the original

349
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,300
employee gazing servants everybody does

350
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,439
it differently now but the original

351
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,540
stuff came from the Gallup research

352
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,269
organizations and their research into

353
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:51,540
what it meant to be to be have engaged

354
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:54,839
employees and lo and behold to have

355
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,339
engage employees to have people stay you

356
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,629
need good management you probably also

357
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,600
heard the phrase people going to leave

358
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:02,519
companies they need managers that also

359
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,850
basically comes from the Gallup research

360
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,980
which is to say the most prominent

361
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,810
reason for someone moving from one

362
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,579
relation to another as Bears they're not

363
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,410
pleased with their management may or may

364
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,508
not be your experience I get that that

365
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,519
is the most prominent most possible

366
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:21,209
frequently cited reason for people

367
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,860
switching jobs okay so one of the ways

368
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:24,388
you practice one of the ways we'd be

369
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,920
mitigating in fact ineffective

370
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,470
management is to get to know the folks

371
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,128
who are working for us and to realize

372
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,540
that the single kind of one of those

373
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:35,310
critical rules that we learned in

374
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,230
kindergarten or that people think that

375
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,899
we learn is we treat everybody the same

376
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,790
and the way we play the way the reason

377
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,110
for the title of that book and the

378
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,910
reason for this phrase break all the

379
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,949
rules is because that is the first rule

380
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,170
you need to break as a manager you do

381
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:51,180
not absolutely do not treat everybody

382
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,370
the same in the way that you may think

383
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,008
of it okay and that what that means is

384
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,740
each of you as drew as a contributor

385
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,990
each of you as a direct report to a

386
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,149
manager need something different than

387
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,050
you appear or than somebody else in your

388
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:08,579
organization do you need to be assessed

389
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,859
and calibrated across your team

390
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,388
absolutely absolutely we're not talking

391
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,160
about performance management here we're

392
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,839
talking about how you treat people we

393
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,089
communicate with people uniquely because

394
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,829
people are unique individuals and we

395
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:21,360
work with people uniquely because people

396
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:23,399
are unique individuals that's what

397
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,579
anybody okay that's what we mean by

398
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,829
breaking the rules we mean treat someone

399
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:30,750
individually how they need to be treated

400
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:32,399
so that they can be the best worker and

401
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,759
the best team member and the best

402
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,339
contributor that they do so as an

403
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,470
effective manager the first goal should

404
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,329
be what does this what does this person

405
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,279
bring you to me what does this person

406
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:47,459
need and I need to have to have to tell

407
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,589
me that I need to hear so and this is

408
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,339
described in depth okay but I'll give

409
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:55,000
you the overview oh and quickly

410
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,700
and that is let the director first so

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,890
the effective manager says what do you

412
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,060
have for me

413
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,620
what-what-what Tecla things with things

414
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,000
who I need to hear with things do we do

415
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,740
you want to talk about what do you want

416
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,050
to start with some folks will come right

417
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,310
in and start with project stuff here's

418
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,750
this Tuesday update I'm glad to come

419
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,609
working on here's the most critical

420
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,349
thing I need here's the roadblock online

421
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,599
anything to establish the board kind of

422
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:18,490
thing other folks will be like hey you

423
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:21,069
know I had this cool experience over the

424
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,140
weekend let me tell you about that or

425
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,639
you know what another third person will

426
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,370
come in and say I'm really not getting

427
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,050
along with Bob I've gotta figure out how

428
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:31,209
like Bob and I can work together more

429
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:35,230
effectively or better figure out how it

430
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:37,600
Bob can stop the enough somehow right so

431
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,880
so it really depends on the person and

432
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,370
the effective manager knows you know one

433
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,800
on one is about the direct not about the

434
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,750
manager because the final thing that you

435
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,399
can say about that is if your manager

436
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,920
eats your time it's probably not hard

437
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,270
for your manager to get time right

438
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,890
they'll schedule some time and say move

439
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,000
that meeting that you're in come out of

440
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,850
that thing it's urgent

441
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,550
and need you it is not easy for each of

442
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,840
us to get time with our names okay I

443
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,820
have something that I have to be both

444
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,409
with my manager about it's it's much

445
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,840
much harder for me to get that managers

446
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,760
time my managers time than it is for

447
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,530
them to get time with me does that make

448
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,790
sense the reason why it's scheduled the

449
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,260
reason why it's weekly is because

450
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,389
absolutely we miss it

451
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,580
absolutely things have to get

452
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,860
rescheduled and moved around so we need

453
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,570
to make sure we're prioritizing it you

454
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,510
need to make sure that the time is

455
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,389
scheduled and the time is is is

456
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:34,960
important so even when I'm traveling I

457
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,120
took my one-on-one even when I saw I was

458
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,560
even in and I only thought I want to

459
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,719
think about this because of a direct

460
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,250
report side of it and something

461
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,100
exceptional and I didn't think that it

462
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,050
was what she did when I was in India 12

463
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,820
hours away I still held my one of the

464
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,659
ones you know right before bed or right

465
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,639
after I woke up so it's difficult to do

466
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,080
it as a manager but you need to stick

467
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,600
with it it's a very important practice

468
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,000
in dental memory you are there to listen

469
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,469
first okay

470
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,450
ideally the agenda

471
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,879
this 10 minutes for the direct 10

472
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,159
minutes for you 10 minutes shared maybe

473
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,529
15 minutes for the direct 15 minutes for

474
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:14,139
you maybe some days 29 minutes for the

475
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:17,049
direct and one minute for you okay 30

476
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:18,969
minutes usually okay weekly one-on-one

477
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:24,190
when its weekly you don't need much more

478
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:31,500
than Thurmond so let's talk about the

479
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:31,500
third essential practice experience

480
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,580
manager majorly account was a calendar

481
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:38,529
light switch is a good one to clarify

482
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,330
man shows a calendar invite because a

483
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:42,850
manager most often will have the

484
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,100
conflicts right so a very often

485
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,389
right-click the proposed new time thing

486
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,789
I'll get that stuff from my directs

487
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:52,678
absolutely but more often I'm the one

488
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:52,679
moving the calendar much easier to do it

489
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,158
good so two answers to that question

490
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,759
first anything for me so your mileage

491
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,529
may vary

492
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,110
right for me anything more than eight

493
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:16,570
directs really really tough really

494
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:20,740
really tough to manage it's possible to

495
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,689
do 1015 it's possible but in that

496
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,049
speaking about scalability in that kind

497
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,330
of range

498
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:27,610
even if 8 and Beyond you may have to go

499
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,230
to every other week right let's flip

500
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,758
things out you may be you still want to

501
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,139
keep that the minimum 30 minutes you

502
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:34,269
definitely want to go to a 15 minute

503
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:36,039
one-on-one totally ineffective and you

504
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,870
can't really go up to one hour very

505
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,120
often with many people in that kind of

506
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,258
situation but every other week is not is

507
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,939
not a bad idea

508
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:45,700
the second answer that question though

509
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,740
is one-on-ones are your most powerful

510
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,840
tool as a manager that's why it's

511
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,029
practice number two okay

512
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,769
it's your the most powerful tool if

513
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,899
you're consistently doing weekly

514
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:58,870
one-on-ones with even ten people with

515
00:20:55,899 --> 00:21:00,039
even ten direct guess what that's what

516
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,449
you're getting all your escalation

517
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,070
engineer important stubborn each one of

518
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,320
those people they know they have the

519
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,250
time so they don't come to you randomly

520
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,389
they don't say hey Bob hey Jill I need I

521
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,869
really need you to take care of this

522
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:15,219
thing when they know in eight hours in

523
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,320
twelve hours and 24

524
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,330
in three days I have a one-on-one let me

525
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,939
just wait till that time so that becomes

526
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,520
a very effective tool for managing that

527
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,679
that person is individual either staff

528
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,418
dating or directly employer or your one

529
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,280
that once as we get the vast majority of

530
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:37,530
your action items or the things that you

531
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:40,990
need to knock down to the roadblock so

532
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:43,000
the second critical behavior is a

533
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,159
manager we need to you need to talk

534
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,169
about and work on performance so this is

535
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,270
frequent feedback positive and negative

536
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:53,950
we're talking about behavior and not

537
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:55,809
intent so when you use the word us when

538
00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:01,360
you use the words us in them you

539
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:03,700
communicate siloed and and and in and in

540
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,229
appropriate kinds of attitudes so a very

541
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,900
specific behavior right when you're

542
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,120
typing an email and you say well I

543
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,710
really can't work with them that's the

544
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,559
thing that's the behavior that you're

545
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,240
talking about performance on when you're

546
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,190
in the meeting and you're taking notes

547
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,710
on a laptop I need you to not do that

548
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,450
because it really communicates to me and

549
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,130
it communicates to our team members that

550
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,659
you're not engaged if we're convincing

551
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,640
to do an email even if you're taking

552
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:30,610
notes when you're on your laptop etc etc

553
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,559
these are behaviors behaviors is what we

554
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,600
give performance on performance feedback

555
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,100
we don't get performance to be back on

556
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,959
in ten I have no idea what you guys are

557
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,189
thinking your manager doesn't know even

558
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,650
you don't know what your director

559
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,120
community you have an idea maybe even

560
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,460
they tell you that what what they're

561
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,739
down what you communicate on in terms of

562
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,380
performance is behavior not intent

563
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,120
because behavior is modifiable behavior

564
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,039
is changeable you can't convince

565
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,399
somebody to change the heart or change

566
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,770
their mom I'm sorry okay we talk about

567
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,140
what's going on today so that we can

568
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,539
encourage the right behavior in the

569
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,120
future so when I give you positive

570
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:09,600
feedback on Scott do more of this thing

571
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,510
because this is what makes my job easier

572
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,030
that's what we want to do or Alice

573
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,080
please stop doing that because that

574
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,870
makes my job harder

575
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,949
okay now for reference and again

576
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:25,449
scalability and and just

577
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,220
frequency here to see you have an idea I

578
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,860
try to give at least one piece of

579
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:34,659
feedback to every direct report every

580
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:36,519
week okay if more frequent can happen

581
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:38,889
two or three pieces of feedback every

582
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:41,230
week that's awesome wonderful but one or

583
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:42,428
two things on feedback every quarter not

584
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:53,470
good at this now we're looking for

585
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:54,730
frequent positive negative oh I love

586
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,960
that question because it's a weakness of

587
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,169
mine I don't know if you ask them on

588
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,809
purpose but if so it checks in the mail

589
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:03,450
the tendency if you don't know me

590
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:06,129
personality-wise I'm a very optimistic

591
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,059
outgoing person so I tend to give

592
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:12,869
positive feedback

593
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:12,869
oh so I use an app to track what kind

594
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:21,939
if you're curious but it showed me it

595
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,440
encourages me to do feedback every week

596
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,940
are you happier every day and I'm gonna

597
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,159
get to it every day but then get to it

598
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,049
every week and I track okay for a direct

599
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,779
report one two pieces of five positive

600
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:33,610
feedback for director for two two pieces

601
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:35,710
of negative except for exception so that

602
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,899
just keeps me aware of what I'm doing

603
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,850
and I don't always use it as a base as a

604
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:42,820
guideline right versus a rule but yeah

605
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,549
yep yes one bad very frequent feedback

606
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,730
gift it's also important that it is

607
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:51,249
closer to the Kosovo moment great thank

608
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,450
you and again again if I I've said it a

609
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:54,330
lot already but I'm gonna read I'm gonna

610
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,860
emphasize all of these behaviors

611
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,869
described in depth in here and that is

612
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,019
also part of it which is you want it to

613
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:04,509
be close to the thing right so we ve

614
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:06,460
mail was written a few earlier today

615
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:07,960
great time to get feedback a Theban

616
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,820
email was resident where the behavior

617
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,590
was practice

618
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,470
the meeting three weeks ago not a good

619
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:15,629
time for me okay find something else if

620
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,010
they're doing it frequently guess what

621
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,680
you're gonna have lots of opportunities

622
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,040
you don't have to worry about you missed

623
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,950
it

624
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,960
no big deal you can't wait your

625
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,850
one-on-one one-on-ones is a great time

626
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,090
for feedback from me I find because I

627
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,860
gotta focus time all my 12 two of my

628
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,020
three direct reports are not in Austin

629
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,760
so video is is helpful

630
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,620
I do feedback over the phone on a

631
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,870
regular basis but I prefer face-to-face

632
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:45,090
via video systems sometimes I'll wait

633
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:47,969
for long in terms of some of the other

634
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,679
activities that we're doing let's focus

635
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,420
on number four coaching and delegation

636
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,430
I'm gonna breeze over these because

637
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,110
these are very deep topics and we don't

638
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,670
have enough time to cover them so I want

639
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,179
to make sure you know what the behaviors

640
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:01,590
are and again these are the final two

641
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,910
critical management behaviors that are

642
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,010
covered in this book the effective

643
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,910
management for critical behaviors or

644
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,890
effective manager or know your people

645
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:14,070
communicate about performance asks for

646
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:17,070
more and push work down both of which

647
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,800
are in the next to you so we do coaching

648
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,840
and delegation for coaching now in terms

649
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,550
in asking for when we coach our team

650
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,050
members we collaborate on what we're

651
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,360
going to do so we're working together

652
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,520
you and I to try and figure out what is

653
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,800
our goal and they were working together

654
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,360
you and I on what is the plan to get to

655
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,340
that goal and then we're working

656
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,780
together you and I on what's just how

657
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,459
how are you doing on that point

658
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,889
positive usually weekly in the

659
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,220
one-on-one okay what progress have you

660
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,770
made

661
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,900
it's absolutely weekly though it's not

662
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,490
monthly it's not quarterly this is a

663
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,760
skill that we want to develop and grow

664
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:54,870
in you and so we're working on it all

665
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:57,060
the time every week okay we agree on

666
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,580
what we're going to do and then I want

667
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,770
to see progress from you hopefully

668
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,780
weekly but definitely every other or

669
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,460
every thirty we want to see something so

670
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,950
we actually needs to be something you

671
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,660
can do in a day or two because he got a

672
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:15,950
week to do and you got plenty of other

673
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:15,950
stuff on your plate that's coach hey

674
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:26,240
in terms of delegation okay delegation

675
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:27,980
is a powerful tool as a manager this is

676
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,320
probably one that's like Captain Obvious

677
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,140
but let me tell you why it's powerful

678
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,149
you get more time back as a manager if

679
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,559
you've been managing you know you just

680
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,320
don't have enough time in the world to

681
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,070
do everything that's being asked it

682
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,570
probably is a contributor that's

683
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,918
probably your status right now - you

684
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,799
would love to be able to delegate things

685
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,840
and great you probably can

686
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,870
so you free up some time delegation is a

687
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,459
powerful tool for empowering your team

688
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,939
communicating to them that you depend on

689
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,309
them

690
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,350
then you want them to be effective

691
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:59,450
contributors and you want them to be

692
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,520
doing doing their job by giving them

693
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,140
more responsibilities right and then the

694
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,658
final thing that's great about

695
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,679
delegation is that is how you develop

696
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:09,620
the person that's going to take your job

697
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,030
so you can take the next okay probably

698
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,439
everybody in this room especially if

699
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,178
you're coming to a talk about management

700
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,970
you want to grow in your career I'll

701
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:18,679
make that assumption okay if you want to

702
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,169
grow in your career one of the things

703
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,730
that hold you back often is so many is

704
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:24,559
not available to take the thing that

705
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,340
you're doing today well that's how you

706
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,918
fix it which worked out okay all right

707
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,330
again talk about in depth so now we're

708
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,970
going to move on to a few other things

709
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,260
that are covered by write by either a

710
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,809
different book or some different stuff

711
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,490
so I'm gonna talk about execution

712
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:43,580
because we can't talk about getting

713
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,559
results without describing what that

714
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:49,850
means and how to get from here to there

715
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:54,740
so who participates in annual goal

716
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:56,719
setting for their team or company great

717
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,220
who has a personal set of goals either

718
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,940
quarterly goals or annual goals

719
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:05,000
ricky-ricky down awesome love to hear

720
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,289
okay so - what one book if you are

721
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,840
looking for personal goal-setting

722
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:10,460
guidance is your best year ever and I

723
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,620
realize now I don't think I have that on

724
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,320
my book list your best year ever by

725
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,428
Michael Hyatt if you're looking for a

726
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,159
framework for setting personal goals

727
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:21,520
that is

728
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,550
our agreements if you're looking for how

729
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,220
to do goal-setting and execution on

730
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:30,909
those goals with your team or within a

731
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:33,130
division or within your company best

732
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,780
recommendation I've ever found and in

733
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,020
working with right now review the system

734
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:41,110
the four disciplines of execution it's

735
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:44,200
abbreviated for DX it's by the Franklin

736
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,580
Covey folks published it many years ago

737
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,290
and it's based on some of their research

738
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,540
and their coaching and guidance with

739
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,940
organizations the four disciplines of

740
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,070
execution is a framework and it's

741
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,500
actually listed here these things are

742
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,909
the four disciplines of execution -

743
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,910
described in the book of the same name

744
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:03,370
and of the guidance from again the

745
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:07,210
Franklin Covey folks the idea here it is

746
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:09,850
you you identify something that you want

747
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,400
to work on the wildly important goal or

748
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,530
the essential initiative or their

749
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,220
terminology is weak wildly important

750
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:20,440
goal you build a way for tracking it the

751
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,270
reason for a scoreboard if you can

752
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,580
imagine being an escape IAM during a

753
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,760
football game or be go to the stadium at

754
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,310
the World Series if you're an Astros fan

755
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,980
then imagine watch the game with no

756
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:34,990
sport look how fun are compelling is

757
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,430
that not at all if no idea what the heck

758
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,170
is going on right especially in football

759
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,120
game all sorts of people doing some this

760
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,130
of that what down is it what's the score

761
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:46,959
I have no idea when the scoreboard is

762
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:50,650
there everybody is focused what's going

763
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,020
on the coach the team the quarterback or

764
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,480
the pitcher or the catcher or whatever

765
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,570
the court you're talking about in the

766
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,090
audience and the announcers everybody is

767
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,770
laser focused on the school play that's

768
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,929
why they emphasize and talk about

769
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:07,570
scoreboard concept when a no more read

770
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:10,030
the book multi-ball those specific

771
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,860
actions the idea here is strategic plans

772
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,500
and goals are all great but what are we

773
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,040
doing this week what are we doing next

774
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,630
week

775
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,399
what are we doing this month what are we

776
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:22,170
doing this quarter so that's the concept

777
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,170
they're not not rocket science yep

778
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,230
is the short answer

779
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:36,000
you probably don't they were always and

780
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,170
there are plenty of books written I've

781
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,510
read some of them there are plenty of

782
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:41,280
books written about that concept

783
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,780
dangerous concept the concept of not

784
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,920
business isn't what you were saying but

785
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,590
the concept that people talk about

786
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,840
managing your boss or managing up very

787
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,870
dangerous activity do it very carefully

788
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,090
okay if you do it at all it could be a

789
00:31:51,870 --> 00:32:00,030
career limiting move right resume

790
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:02,090
generating event something like that so

791
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,560
if you have somebody receptive

792
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,030
then you might introduce something

793
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,409
that's not your recommendation right you

794
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,360
might introduce two minutes away to this

795
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,470
fantastic presentation last time this

796
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,020
guy who's black Oh

797
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,880
presenter recommended this book called

798
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:19,830
the four disciplines of execution by the

799
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,210
w we should look at you know but beyond

800
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,350
that not sure I would go much further

801
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,850
than that unless you have a constraint

802
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,980
awesome relationship with your boss

803
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,469
hopefully you do in which case have a

804
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:32,340
conversation it helps the target go to

805
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:34,410
lunch yeah sure the last part of this in

806
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,639
terms of execution is making sure we're

807
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,650
all accountable right making sure

808
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,320
retracting to our goals and making sure

809
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:43,110
we execute them none of this is rocket

810
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,990
science but the hard part is what they

811
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,169
the terminology to use in the book is

812
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,940
whirlwind

813
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,890
so is that describe your day to day it

814
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,300
describes my day today the whirlwind

815
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,270
that's their term for the day to day

816
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,550
that's why we only get stuff done that's

817
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,220
why the only sometime because we all had

818
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:01,050
that whirlwind day today so if you want

819
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,540
a system or a framework for doing it

820
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:07,260
with a team the four disciplines of

821
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:09,980
execution all right let's get going cuz

822
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:13,320
I need to be careful of my time here um

823
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,210
speaking of time so we already said it I

824
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,010
already talked about in terms of

825
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,350
efficiency and effectiveness well one

826
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,540
very powerful technique now I'm

827
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,699
switching to this book they had the

828
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,950
effective executive by Drucker

829
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,620
one powerful technique that Drucker

830
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,540
describes in in there it's actually the

831
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,540
first of his five practices

832
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,850
for effectiveness is knowing time and

833
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,680
his description so this is a guy sorry

834
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,469
if you're not familiar this is a guy who

835
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,750
worked with very very famous CEOs and

836
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:46,560
executives in huge companies and small

837
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,810
companies for like I don't know 60 or 70

838
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:52,169
years or something okay a management

839
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:55,350
consultant why they consider the Guru or

840
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:57,350
the the best and most powerful thinker

841
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,240
about management in the last 50 meters

842
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:03,300
so this guy sitting down with CEOs all

843
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,980
the time and his very common experience

844
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,659
which he described in the book is that

845
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,889
CEOs and any other leader I have a very

846
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,418
incorrect assumption or do not really

847
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,918
know how they spend their time they're

848
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:16,020
convinced they're spending their time in

849
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,500
sales meetings or meeting with clients

850
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,179
or executives or trying to try and

851
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,550
understand their customers and when in

852
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,280
fact they actually measure their time or

853
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,600
more likely the assistant measures their

854
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,340
time and tracks what they're doing

855
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,080
they're spending time on email they're

856
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,060
spending time in meetings with within

857
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,310
internal groups they're spending time on

858
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,320
things that do not all match up with

859
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,940
what they do now these are the folks who

860
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,190
are the highest paid in the organization

861
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,060
right they need to be spending every

862
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:47,340
minute defective but it would be very

863
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,889
incorrect for each of us to consider

864
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,450
ourselves any less important in some

865
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,489
sense I realize that none of us are as

866
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:56,279
high paid probably as our top is our top

867
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:57,509
person in our organization however every

868
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,790
one of us as an ink event is an

869
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,950
executive as a knowledge worker as an

870
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,240
important contributor who has the impact

871
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,069
in the organization when we make a

872
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,209
decision we need to be careful to make

873
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,720
sure that we're spending our time

874
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:11,490
effectively so if you don't know how you

875
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,970
spend your time in a weekly and monthly

876
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:17,129
basis you should venture there are tools

877
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,529
to do this I know in call time even on

878
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,330
my Mac there's another one called office

879
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,400
time that I've seen people using them in

880
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,020
Windows which is very effective rescue

881
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,590
time is one two that I've seen people

882
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:31,110
use you can use a tool you can use the

883
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,410
old girl classic notepad right what did

884
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,970
I do in the last

885
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,339
whether they doing last 15 what are they

886
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:39,100
do in the last few hours okay if you're

887
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,930
not tracking your time I guarantee you

888
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,299
you have the wrong idea of where you're

889
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,040
spending I'm not saying I spent my time

890
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,170
effectively or perfectly every week I

891
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,779
definitely do not I have a lot more time

892
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,700
tracking email than I care to admit okay

893
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,090
it's like this versus what I wouldn't

894
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:57,669
want to be doing okay but I know that

895
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,770
about me and my question to you is do

896
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,900
you know that about you do you know who

897
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,070
you're spending your time Parkinson's

898
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,210
Law like you're not familiar with it

899
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:08,350
anybody can close it for me

900
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:12,550
Perkins in law now work expands to the

901
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:14,140
time a lot to some nodding heads because

902
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,460
you know and you've felt it and if you

903
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,960
have two hours to complete something

904
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,730
guess what it's going to take two hours

905
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,590
did you have five days to complete

906
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:23,020
something guess what go take five videos

907
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:25,120
if you have five minutes I'm gonna take

908
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:27,850
five minutes that's just how it works

909
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,740
I had a certain number of days and hours

910
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:33,610
to complete this presentation and I

911
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:37,209
barely got a pen it's got to test soon

912
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:39,820
so where you're spending time and I are

913
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:42,220
spending time and then and then the one

914
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:46,510
of the ways or one of the things to make

915
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,430
sure that you're doing what um what you

916
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:52,470
want to be doing is then keeping an eye

917
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:55,569
on that time on that time report and and

918
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:57,790
then understanding whether that time

919
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,070
span is how you want to be so the reason

920
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,960
I put this up is that third way is to

921
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:05,320
remind me of a book called essentialism

922
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,520
by Greg consuming to recommend and I

923
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,650
learned one of the things I learned in

924
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,930
that book we in the title is his perhaps

925
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:12,700
obvious but I will explain his whole

926
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,069
argument in that book is about how you

927
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,319
should be focused on the most important

928
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,180
thing to do right now and try to get rid

929
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,520
of everything else which is a relatively

930
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,730
impossible task in security I think but

931
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,050
probably and everything else one thing I

932
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:29,230
learned in that book besides the obvious

933
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:31,900
is that the the etymology of the word

934
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,770
priority so the word priority until

935
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,140
about 30 or 40 years ago

936
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:40,370
singular work there was no such thing as

937
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:42,470
priorities before 1915 yourself okay it

938
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:46,009
was a priority we have a priority and

939
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:47,990
that's it and we I would I would argue

940
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,820
and I think Greg McEwan and I think very

941
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,799
few in our views for sure we need to get

942
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:55,670
back to that definition but priority a

943
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,200
singular speaking of there is there are

944
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,340
some people who are successful and then

945
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,689
there are Warren Buffett but yeah he

946
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,280
says no to almost everything just like

947
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:09,500
we should so in communication we're

948
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,670
talking about relationship building I'm

949
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,290
gonna leave you with something because

950
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,800
again there's not enough time to talk

951
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:18,110
about it really and do it justice so

952
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,810
this is more of a again a pointer to

953
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:24,440
resources that that I would encourage

954
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:26,779
you to explore but communication is much

955
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,450
much more about listening than it is

956
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,760
about talking okay or observing your

957
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:39,259
apps observing endlessly it is about

958
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:41,510
talking Drucker said it this way and the

959
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,680
author of this book here enforcement

960
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,680
said it this way

961
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:55,080
I'll go back to explain what I mean by

962
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,660
those quotes and by what we're talking

963
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,310
about here communication is much more

964
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,049
about knowing your audience and knowing

965
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,490
about how to listen to the person you

966
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,540
can be an audience of one right in a

967
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:08,399
one-on-one it can be an audience of 6070

968
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,800
sometimes I don't know

969
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:17,670
so maybe on the back counter maybe it's

970
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:19,920
50 artificially inflating the so it's

971
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:23,070
much more about who you're talking to so

972
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,180
one one tool if you're not familiar with

973
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,340
it so you've probably heard about

974
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,540
personality types right people know

975
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,860
their personality type the myers-briggs

976
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:33,930
personality excited I'm an ENFP but one

977
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,130
thing that they that many fewer people

978
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:37,740
are familiar with that I would encourage

979
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:41,370
you to explore is it behavioral

980
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,569
instrument called disco d.i.s.c.o ghin

981
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,270
there's not enough time for me to

982
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,310
explain it in depth but as a broad brush

983
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:50,220
overview the concept is we all have

984
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:53,040
behaviors default behaviors and chosen

985
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:57,230
behaviors and the default behavior might

986
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,230
be a really assertive and task-focused

987
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,970
okay

988
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,490
we might have an assertive or

989
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,520
task-focused behavior at all we might

990
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:09,658
have a dentist earn it

991
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,659
[Music]

992
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:18,670
and people focused default behavior for

993
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:22,769
a reserved and task-focused develop a

994
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:25,779
dinner for Qantas importantly DD is

995
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:28,689
assertive tasks is reserved tasks focus

996
00:40:25,779 --> 00:40:30,880
people and assertive people and past

997
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,920
purpose the reason why this is helpful

998
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,140
is because when you understand

999
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,609
somebody's default behavior you can

1000
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,328
communicate with them more effectively

1001
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:42,788
you can choose as this speaker as the

1002
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:45,369
listener and as the participant you can

1003
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:47,589
choose to behave more like they behave

1004
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:50,589
by the by default so this was a

1005
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:52,420
revelation to me in communication if you

1006
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:54,150
have not gathered it already I'm a very

1007
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,470
assertive and people focused person

1008
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,140
outgoing if you get emails from me I

1009
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:02,589
have lots of exclamation marks and

1010
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:04,420
emoticons and my emails okay when I talk

1011
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:06,190
to you I'm first care first care most

1012
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,779
about what's going on with you how was

1013
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,150
your weekend okay

1014
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:11,890
those guys are things task-focused

1015
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,869
people when they first encounter you

1016
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,460
they're much more interested in the kind

1017
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:16,660
of transactional peace it's not that

1018
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,039
they don't care about you as a person

1019
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,230
but the first thing that they're leading

1020
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:23,470
with is what do we how are we doing on

1021
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:26,079
that project what's going on okay in

1022
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:29,319
technology which is the vast majority of

1023
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,119
us here if if you're not familiar with

1024
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:33,029
your with your dissipated grow style and

1025
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,190
technology you're a vast majority

1026
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:38,500
probably a C which is conscientious and

1027
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,599
that means you're reserved most often

1028
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,740
and that means that you are task focused

1029
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:47,349
and these people like me are struggle

1030
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,288
working with you because because you

1031
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:52,599
write emails that are 50 miles long you

1032
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:54,579
know can i you've lost me in the first

1033
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:57,880
sentence I was waiting for like your

1034
00:41:54,579 --> 00:42:00,970
bottom line up front and and your bottom

1035
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,320
line is like in the bottom line

1036
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,970
[Music]

1037
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:08,330
so I I have learned how to work better

1038
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:10,730
with folks like that and folks like that

1039
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,529
who are starting to observe better and

1040
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,870
listen learn how to work better with me

1041
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,570
and we all need to get more effective so

1042
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:20,630
this is this is the concept that it

1043
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,280
really needs a lot more treatment so

1044
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,020
this is this is something that it's

1045
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,030
interesting to you I don't have a book

1046
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,520
to cover it I have a training course to

1047
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,440
recommend to you and it's from a group

1048
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,060
called manager tools and they have a

1049
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,040
training a one-day training course

1050
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,529
called the effective communications

1051
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,930
conference it's for contributors and for

1052
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:40,370
managers okay and they do it here in

1053
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,529
Austin at least once a year sometimes

1054
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:44,529
twice in one day

1055
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:52,400
very good

1056
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,800
so decision-making is a critical skill

1057
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,670
for everyone in particular executives

1058
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,330
and knowledge workers like us the there

1059
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:04,610
is a way to do it well and for InfoSec

1060
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,799
people in particular part of the way of

1061
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,600
doing it well is to make sure that you

1062
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:14,560
do it with the businesses not your mind

1063
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,560
because this is why your business exists

1064
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,400
whoever you work for whatever you do

1065
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,140
you're a non-profit

1066
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,630
you're in manufacturing you're in retail

1067
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,589
you're in finance you're in high

1068
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,320
technology

1069
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,660
I don't care your business exists to do

1070
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,720
this and if you are not contributing to

1071
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,970
this if you are not keeping in mind this

1072
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,720
with every single decision that you

1073
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:41,390
support then you're doing it wrong

1074
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:44,000
absolutely doing it wrong this is why

1075
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:46,310
you exist this is why I exist this is

1076
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,870
why you're paid this is how we make

1077
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:50,330
money okay

1078
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,880
this right here you gotta keep this in

1079
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:55,060
mind if you want to make effective

1080
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,380
decisions first it has to begin with

1081
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:03,759
business trip I have to begin with

1082
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:03,760
custom to me

1083
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,580
keeping the customers absolutely

1084
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,560
absolutely absolutely and keeping that

1085
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,660
in mind you're able to support a

1086
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,880
decision with that in mind but primarily

1087
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,580
if we're not delivering something to a

1088
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,560
customer right we can so so there's

1089
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:24,310
absolutely Bailey there's Bailey and I

1090
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,840
work for the same organization we

1091
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:28,299
absolutely have to keep this in mind of

1092
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,730
course then we're we are part of the

1093
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,770
risk management piece of the business we

1094
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,210
are part of the keeping the customer not

1095
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:37,330
necessarily going to get the customer

1096
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,770
okay but if we don't keep in mind that

1097
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:41,080
the product folks were working at that

1098
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:42,910
we're trying to enable and support that

1099
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,740
the the sales tools were trying to

1100
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:47,680
enable and support the marketing folks

1101
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,169
the legal folks okay even the HR and

1102
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,049
finance folks then everybody's driving

1103
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,550
towards creating our customer we have to

1104
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,570
we at least have to keep that in mind

1105
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:57,430
sir

1106
00:44:55,570 --> 00:45:00,369
I'm saving along that you're not keeping

1107
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,720
your customers so we're gonna have a

1108
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:03,550
hard time creating new ones

1109
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,350
absolutely absolutely great great

1110
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,760
absolutely so yeah if we think of

1111
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:09,160
ourselves as creating customers I think

1112
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,869
that's also an excellent way of

1113
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,200
observing the role of information

1114
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:16,720
security a few other things the elements

1115
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,549
of an effective decision are v practice

1116
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,200
that's described here in the effective

1117
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,700
executive so diving deep but that's

1118
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,140
interesting to you and to very

1119
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,118
high-level description in Drucker's

1120
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:28,420
texas was not appropriate for this right

1121
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,130
now you have to have a lot of people in

1122
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,810
the room to make the right decision

1123
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,540
because you have to know that you have a

1124
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:36,450
diversity of opinion and going to make

1125
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,380
sure the decisions are revisited

1126
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,939
particularly increase the security I

1127
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,130
think the week we that we suck at this

1128
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,810
in the sense that we make we make

1129
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,000
recommendations to be support decisions

1130
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:48,100
all the time and we rarely go back and

1131
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,570
see wait a minute was that the right

1132
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,000
thing to have recommended at the time

1133
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,890
because did it really make that big of a

1134
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,869
deal that was this that this was

1135
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:58,089
remediated in in a certain amount of

1136
00:45:55,869 --> 00:46:01,660
time when they can be focused on driving

1137
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:03,760
back the deliverable for for this

1138
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,558
technical debt a thing to eliminate or

1139
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,849
something like that

1140
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,829
I don't know maybe the answer is

1141
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:09,299
absolutely yes we did the right thing or

1142
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:11,099
you should revisit those decisions as

1143
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:13,019
best as you possibly can that's one way

1144
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:16,769
of measuring whether you make effective

1145
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:19,468
decisions strengths based leadership is

1146
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:21,508
number nine making sure that strengths

1147
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:23,279
is what you're focusing on so this is

1148
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:24,959
also described in depth by the Gallup

1149
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:27,689
Organization this is also it came out of

1150
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:29,788
their research 20 or 30 years ago and

1151
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:32,089
the concept here is quite simple we all

1152
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:34,799
have strengths we all have weaknesses

1153
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:36,269
compensate for weaknesses by bringing

1154
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:39,959
people on your team who have strengths

1155
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:42,058
that are not yours that's it right there

1156
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:43,618
okay make sure that you know what your

1157
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:45,509
strengths are make sure that you know

1158
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,660
where you're weak and bring people into

1159
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:50,489
your team encourage folks who have

1160
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:53,999
strengths that are not yours if you have

1161
00:46:50,489 --> 00:47:03,779
had diversity of skills diversity of

1162
00:46:53,999 --> 00:47:05,368
talents really observed I think in a

1163
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,680
very positive way there's a wonderful

1164
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:09,779
trend but it makes the security

1165
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,609
community to actively talk about the

1166
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:14,099
fact that we have health issues with

1167
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:15,929
insecurity and sure we have physical

1168
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,579
health issues all across the world

1169
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:19,319
that's not necessarily what I'm talking

1170
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,630
about I'm talking more about most mental

1171
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,069
and emotional health issues and so I

1172
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,679
wouldn't repeat this as a top-level

1173
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:28,829
issue for us as managers and leaders and

1174
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,209
information security to be aware for me

1175
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:32,219
this plays out

1176
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:34,410
most likely the most writ rather than

1177
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:36,539
most actively or most frequently in my

1178
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,729
kind of daily and weekly practices

1179
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:40,739
whether you call the rituals or not like

1180
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:42,598
I do it's up to you but I have a morning

1181
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:44,459
kind of ritual I go through and he being

1182
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,349
ritual I go through and part of that is

1183
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:48,178
locating my day so I'm not doing work

1184
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:50,039
all the freaking time because it

1185
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:51,449
certainly could it's there right

1186
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,400
it sure is there for YouTube we can

1187
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:57,630
always be doing work it's very unhealthy

1188
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,519
and and we need to be careful as

1189
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:01,469
managers and leaders that we're not just

1190
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,939
worried about our own health we're

1191
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:05,009
concerned about our team's health as

1192
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:07,229
well as as much as possible I realize

1193
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:09,900
that we can be too intrusive but

1194
00:48:07,229 --> 00:48:12,328
modeling that for your team modeling

1195
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,839
healthy practices as well we manage our

1196
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:15,549
leader and then you

1197
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,739
courage any healthy practices with your

1198
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:21,009
team is something that you should be

1199
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:22,390
careful and remember I don't know it

1200
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:24,249
work-life balance is really the way to

1201
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:28,379
say if there are issues of that with

1202
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:30,729
that phrase but whatever it is for you

1203
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,930
please make sure you know what that is I

1204
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:33,640
mean you're practicing on a regular

1205
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:37,299
basis whatever that balances the time

1206
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:39,578
it may be 90 10 it may be 50 50 I don't

1207
00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:40,869
know that's up to you but you've got to

1208
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:47,890
find something that works and you got to

1209
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:50,380

00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:51,729
your into the whirlwind oh baby you

1211
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,140

manager I have three mentors that

1214

working with for almost 10 years now

1216

I also mentor people which is another

1217
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,210
way to grow as a leader yourself if

1218
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:09,009
you're not a manager today and there are

1219
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,259
people that you can mental earth you

1220
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:13,059

on that as well and this is part of it

1226
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:25,450
and then practicing these and central

1227
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:26,979
practices I suppose was the most obvious

1228
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:30,069
thing in the world but that's how we get

1229
00:49:26,979 --> 00:49:31,868
better at doing these stuff I'm gonna

1230
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:33,549
just list these up here lieutenant

1231
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:35,499
Central breakfast is one more time we

1232
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:37,960
talked about it all at the very end I

1233
00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:40,749
had journal and reflect this goes into

1234
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,089
the health piece of it a journal I tried

1235
00:49:40,749 --> 00:49:45,009
a general everyday I don't always get to

1236
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:48,729
it and then in terms of going forward

1237
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:52,089
and being a better person I read these

1238
00:49:48,729 --> 00:49:53,468
are the books that I recommended I tried

1239
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:56,109
the recommender mention I did not

1240
00:49:53,469 --> 00:49:58,029
mention them all this is a Productivity

1241
00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:59,619
book if you're not familiar with it this

1242
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:01,390
is a different kind of productivity book

1243
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:03,569
by Counting pork this is a

1244
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,890
decision-making book which is excellent

1245
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:07,808

1246
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:09,279
book I mentioned strengths based

1247
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:11,349
leadership in the strengths section I

1248
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:14,469
didn't call that as a book and this is a

1249
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:16,719
