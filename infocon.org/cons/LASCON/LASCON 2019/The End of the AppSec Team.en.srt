internet if you want to contact me

6
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:53,070
Twitter is the best way and you're at

7
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:56,879
last con 2019 and this talk is called

8
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:02,580
the end of the OPSEC team and I want to

9
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:05,700
set expectations up early I will the

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,179
purpose of this talk is to engage your

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,930
brain and thinking about the future and

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,960
thinking about how we can get to a

13
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,690
different future and it's not so much

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,339
about telling you what the future is

15
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,310
going to be or how we're gonna get there

16
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,390
it's just me engaging my brain and

17
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,180
trying to think about the future so

18
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,160
hopefully I've set that up enough I do

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,360
also want to have another disclaimer

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,850
here emphasis on team this is not I'm

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,350
not proposing that application security

22
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,720
is going away I'm not expecting that our

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,509
jobs as application security engineers

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:55,080
it's going to go away I'm talking about

25
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:58,709
the team itself okay as kind of

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,849
mentioned I've been on the application

27
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,390
security side at a few different

28
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:07,590
companies web application security

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:09,330
mostly and will be joining Gusto's soon

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,319
but that doesn't count as experience

31
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,819
because I haven't experienced it yet

32
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,649
along the way I also created a static

33
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,739
analysis tool for Ruby on Rails called

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,390
break man and then for a few years

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,849
worked on a commercial version of it

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,799
called break man Pro and then that was

37
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:29,579
acquired by synopsis and then I worked

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:33,270
as synopsis for a year as a senior

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:38,360
software engineer on a C++ project which

40
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:41,700
was so far out of my actual skill set

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,400
but it was an interesting experience to

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,670
be just a software developer for a

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,310
little

44
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,260
while and it was interesting to see a

45
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,959
synopsis as a massive company it's like

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,980
12,000 employees and it was interesting

47
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:59,220
to see as a software engineer how did I

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:03,660
interact with the security team how did

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:06,120
you know how did they do things and how

50
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,500
did it affect my daily work all those

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,180
kinds of things and to sum it up

52
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,959
actually I didn't see it do you have

53
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,910
that like as just a software engineer I

54
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,560
never really felt the presence of

55
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,720
security I only knew about it because I

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,030
was friends with someone on the security

57
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,540
team who happened to sit near me that

58
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,700
was it

59
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,380
okay that's not what I'm talking about I

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,988
just want to give you an idea of my

61
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,790
background and as I'm pointing out here

62
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,069
I've only actually worked on three

63
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:38,760
security teams 18t interactive Twitter

64
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:43,649
and SurveyMonkey and yet and that

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:47,850
comprised like seven years or so of

66
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,370
experience and yet I still got to a

67
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,380
point where I wasn't really happy with

68
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,750
it in fact having that year off was

69
00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:00,690
really nice it gave me some perspective

70
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:04,530
on things okay so I want to talk about

71
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:10,560
the future and the future ten years from

72
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:12,359
now is 2029 and so I again I want to get

73
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,239
let's like try to get in the mode this

74
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:17,430
is not a talk where like you're gonna

75
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,989
kind of zone out and then at the end

76
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,358
you're gonna like write down the points

77
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,700
that I made and be happy with where you

78
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,700
ended up like try try and try to follow

79
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,260
along with me please we're thinking

80
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,020
about the future we're thinking about

81
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,270
our jobs in the future application

82
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,760
security in the future and what it's

83
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:40,530
going to look like fortunately someone

84
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,090
made a movie about it and I'm here to

85
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,580
tell you that actually we don't have to

86
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,580
worry about it all because in the future

87
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,880
in 2029 we will only be fighting robots

88
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:54,890
and we'll probably offensive security

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,190
will be much more important but anyways

90
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:02,930
the first Terminator movie I found

91
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,930
it says in the year of darkness 2029

92
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,930
however IRA gave a talk a conference

93
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,699
talk that was Terminator themed so I'm

94
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,699
not gonna do that again so you're safe

95
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,949
all right so here's a question that I've

96
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:23,388
been thinking about our tech teams just

97
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:26,720
destined to fail has anyone else thought

98
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:32,000
about this all right a couple of people

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:35,389
yeah her thinking are like are we just

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,449
destined to fail well what do I mean

101
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,759
okay I tried to list out some things and

102
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:42,650
keeping in mind that I haven't been on a

103
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,509
NAB SEC team for a year so I did have to

104
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,620
like think back a little bit what are

105
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:52,550
all the things that fall into and OPSEC

106
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,409
team's responsibilities and these are

107
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,750
just things that definitely fall on the

108
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:59,509
OPSEC team then there are all the other

109
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,699
things that you also do because you're

110
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:04,280
covering other aspects of security not

111
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:07,460
just apps SEC and I feel like this is a

112
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:12,888
lot of things and I don't know how we

113
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:15,469
have time to do all of these things this

114
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:17,599
was a I think this was a denim group

115
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:21,380
like to download thread fix or something

116
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,360
but I saw this in my I tweeted this out

117
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,069
some years ago because it was just so

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,699
perfect okay size of application

119
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:30,919
security team the options were just me

120
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,169
less than five or more than five those

121
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,389
were the only options I thought this is

122
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:42,830
someone really nailed this one

123
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:44,840
right so here's an example this is 96

124
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:49,539
developers and four application security

125
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,539
people which actually is a decent ratio

126
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,258
but that's still like I think just

127
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,669
seeing it visually as I go actually

128
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:59,779
that's like that's a lot of people

129
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:01,580
that's a lot of developers and the area

130
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:06,250
essentially creating this tsunami of

131
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,250
work for the application security team

132
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,000
and that work is comprised of a lot of

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:18,870
things oh by the way this is what the

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,599
team looks like when you zoom in I spent

135
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,509
a lot of time on that okay all these

136
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,030
things are coming in right and the team

137
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:30,770
is just feeling like this is a lot of

138
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:34,080
stuff yeah quick question quick question

139
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,789
what key size should I use to encrypt

140
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,909
this data and you go wait a second what

141
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:40,110
what what data are you encrypting why

142
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,880
are you encrypting it

143
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,110
where are you storing it where are you

144
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,120
putting the keys that you're asking

145
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,750
about and then that's like half your day

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,750
gone right

147
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,030
just to emphasize further what I felt

148
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,610
like and I gave it a name I guess I just

149
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,859
like to give things names I felt like it

150
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,139
was just this app set grind that I ended

151
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,349
up in where's like okay there's always

152
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,900
way too many design or project reviews

153
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,000
or whatever to do there's always way too

154
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,799
many code reviews I think we've all kind

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,970
of reached a point where we realize the

156
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,259
security team can't review all the code

157
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,960
there's always bug bounties coming in

158
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,750
new CVEs reports coming in from

159
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,460
different tools and then there's just

160
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,400
like security incidents happening all

161
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,419
the time that we have to deal with and

162
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,409
then there's people saying hey I have a

163
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,979
quick question for you

164
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:33,659
and you just honestly I feel like this

165
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,218
is just you just get stuck in like okay

166
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,899
I'm just doing this like this is all

167
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,159
like this is all I have time to do and

168
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,309
it's not even I don't even have enough

169
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,229
time to do this and then when you're

170
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,869
doing your planning you go okay next

171
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,820
quarter or maybe next year we'll do some

172
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,070
work that actually has systemic impact

173
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,170
on the company you know we're gonna

174
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,209
schedule that in right as soon as we get

175
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,430
done with this stuff are people feeling

176
00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,359
like this is accurate or is it was it

177
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:02,339
just me okay heads are nodding okay okay

178
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:09,149
alright so we're we're in there at the

179
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:12,870
same place well the problem is obvious

180
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:14,850
isn't it there are 96 developers and

181
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,130
only four people on this on the app sect

182
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:21,200
team there are not enough people

183
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,900
and the solute I'm sorry to keep me I

184
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:29,570
should just move I'm gonna fix this

185
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:36,829
problem and probably make the camera guy

186
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:40,250
much happier haha okay I'm gonna try not

187
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:43,760
to destroy these cables all right

188
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:46,100
much better okay clearly the team is too

189
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,560
small and the answer is obvious

190
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,700
hire more people and I will be honest

191
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,010
I've been placed I've been at

192
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,220
conferences like this and you sit down

193
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,750
at a table and someone says hey our team

194
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,030
has too much work we're just trying to

195
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,530
hire more people we just have too much

196
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,360
work our team is too small we're just

197
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:09,860
trying to hire more people which is

198
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,410
totally rational but how many people are

199
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,810
you going to hire first of all is really

200
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,120
hard to hire app sect people I don't

201
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:20,119
know if you've experienced that but it's

202
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,520
really hard to hire app sect people how

203
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,110
are you going to hire enough to match

204
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,860
all the developers are you going to have

205
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:31,370
a team this big no I can tell you that

206
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:34,490
you will not have a team this big but I

207
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,230
it seems like we never really think this

208
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,120
through right we kind of get stuck at

209
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,470
this stage all righty

210
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,990
our teams too small we're trying to grow

211
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,750
our security team everyone's trying to

212
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,490
grow their security teams like or they

213
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,870
don't have one and in the future they're

214
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:53,870
gonna be trying to grow their security

215
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:54,530
team so oh I forgot this part problem

216
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:02,570
solved

217
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:06,319
I spent a lot of time on them okay Dave

218
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:09,230
winner at loco moco's sec his past or

219
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,240
this earlier this year he had this slide

220
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,520
and he said I could borrow it there's no

221
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,380
numbers on this so so I think this might

222
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,439
have been made up but I think it's

223
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,790
accurate the talk line is how much code

224
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,290
is being written the middle line is our

225
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,000
budget to buy tools to deal with all the

226
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,969
code that's being written and then the

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,940
bottom line is how many people we have

228
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,810
that we can hire who are specialized in

229
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,570
security

230
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,989
and this gap he termed the software

231
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,460
security crisis but I think this is just

232
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,850
another way of representing what was on

233
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:45,440
the previous slides that there's just

234
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,020
too much code being written too quickly

235
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,140
for us to keep up with now you might

236
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,880
think probably you won't but let's

237
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,710
imagine maybe your friend would think

238
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,620
okay the problem is there's too much

239
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:00,950
code being written too quickly so if we

240
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,880
just slowed down how quickly we're

241
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:06,920
writing code then we could catch up

242
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,300
no like have you ever been or heard of a

243
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,150
company where they're like yes well we

244
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,650
have quarterly releases and that gives

245
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,480
our security team enough time to

246
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,180
actually review everything like no it

247
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,000
actually doesn't work right and I think

248
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,410
probably probably what we all know and

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm not going to talk about it in this

250
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,880
talk but actually faster is better it's

251
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,380
better for everyone as better for

252
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,270
security it's better for the business

253
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,220
it's better for developers faster is

254
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,569
better so we actually we don't want to

255
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,150
slow things down we don't want people to

256
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,710
write less code unless it makes sense to

257
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,770
do so

258
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:42,290
so what's what do we do well we know we

259
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:45,860
the people won't scale we can't hire

260
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:49,819
enough people to meet the amount of code

261
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,320
coming out of development so we should

262
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,990
throw some automation on it

263
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:58,089
right that's how we scale we throw

264
00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:01,280
automation on it problem solved

265
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:05,930
well of course it's not solved just by

266
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:08,030
automation I gave this talk with my

267
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,060
colleagues Neil mattis hall and Alex

268
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:13,760
swollen actually in Austin

269
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,030
OPSEC USA when it was hosted by last con

270
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,380
and we we gave this talk about the

271
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:22,189
automation work that we had done at

272
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,500
Twitter and I hate to bring this up but

273
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,750
people bring it up to me and they say

274
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,420
hey I saw you know I really loved your

275
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:32,150
talk like I heard this last year ok I

276
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:35,329
really loved your talk about automation

277
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:41,180
at Twitter and I want to do that and I

278
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:42,770
said that was 2012 if you're thinking oh

279
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,410
all we need to do is get some automation

280
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,230
and like our apps tech problems are

281
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,059
solved

282
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,889
to me in I don't want to insult this is

283
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,329
not to be insulting this is just like

284
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,189
maybe this is just where I am but I'm

285
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:59,420
like that was six years ago seven years

286
00:13:55,189 --> 00:14:01,579
ago if you're just trying to get to that

287
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,099
point you're way way way behind way

288
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,569
behind where you need to be you need it

289
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,759
you need to do you need to automate as

290
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:10,040
much as you can you have to do that but

291
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,249
that's not where you can you can't stop

292
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:17,149
there that's not the whole solution and

293
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:19,339
I I don't want to feel like I'm just

294
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:22,339
telling you things and like telling you

295
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,209
how people are wrong I was also wrong

296
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,720
about this

297
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:28,638
okay you can go back to my talks where

298
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,559
I'm promoting break man and how

299
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,839
wonderful it is to just automate all

300
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,850
your security and you can go back to

301
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,899
that talk you can go back to this talk

302
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,059
right

303
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,769
hell yeah just automate everything just

304
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,329
automate automate automate and then it

305
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:43,100
makes everything and then you have time

306
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:45,050
to do all those design reviews and all

307
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:49,399
the you know all that other stuff well

308
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:51,949
no actually it's not enough who has said

309
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,779
this I'm sorry who has heard their

310
00:14:51,949 --> 00:15:00,199
friend say this I have said this and I

311
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,939
lots of people say this and not even not

312
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,920
just in this context and lots of context

313
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:08,089
people say this and it's not wrong

314
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:15,139
everybody needs to be involved in

315
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:18,920
security it's not wrong but when there's

316
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:22,850
a security issue does the HR team get

317
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:26,628
paged for that well maybe that's a bad

318
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,910
example probably not right

319
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:31,009
the security team gets paged well

320
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,929
doesn't it that mean that security is

321
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:35,029
actually the security teams job it's

322
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:37,670
also in the name of their team security

323
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:43,309
team so how can it be everyone's job we

324
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:45,199
have a team that deals with that I I

325
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:47,660
really like this tweet it's a little bit

326
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,998
old now this was Matt Conda but he was

327
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,069
quoting Michael Coates who I used to

328
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:57,709
work for and I think that's just this

329
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:59,670
encapsulated into 2016 when I saw this

330
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,699
this really encapsulated how I felt

331
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:05,880
the security team says no to things

332
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,220
right can I use this new tool no can i

333
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,000
deploy to this new cloud thing no can I

334
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,310
open up this port no they say no because

335
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,220
they are incorrectly held accountable

336
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:20,579
for all flaws when there's a security

337
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:25,050
flaw you talk to the security team and

338
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:28,280
then someone says hey security team how

339
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,780
come we had this security flaw and

340
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,480
really is like well wait a second I

341
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,900
didn't write the probably didn't write

342
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,420
the code that has if I did then it's my

343
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,209
fault but I probably didn't write the

344
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,099
code that has the flaw but I'm being

345
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:48,210
held recount accountable as part of the

346
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,280
security team so when we say security is

347
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,960
everyone's job

348
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,120
I don't think actually that's where we

349
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,900
are today but maybe we can get there I

350
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,310
don't want to think about this a little

351
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,780
bit deeper security is everyone's job ok

352
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,490
let's say I'm not a security person and

353
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,520
someone tells me security is everyone's

354
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,150
job that means it's my job this is my

355
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,139
job

356
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,570
I have an actual job and I have let's

357
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,120
say seven hours a day to do it and then

358
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,980
you're asking me to also add so this is

359
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,948
a beautiful diagram I said I spent a lot

360
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,020
of time with security this thing that I

361
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,329
don't even really know what it is it's

362
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,730
kind of this amorphous blob you're

363
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,870
saying put that into my job too and I

364
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,360
don't know what that means

365
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,729
and that's but like I don't have time

366
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,020
for that honestly if I was not a

367
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,020
security person and someone said

368
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:44,730
security is also your job I'd be like

369
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:47,580
yeah I have a real job alright let's

370
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:52,770
look at some quotes this was Jean Kim at

371
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:55,230
loco moco's sec 2018 put it concisely

372
00:17:52,770 --> 00:18:00,060
this was out of his research looking at

373
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:02,450
high-performing IT organizations and

374
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,879
this was some data they had come out and

375
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,680
he said high performers because they are

376
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,410
integrating information security

377
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,360
objectives into everyone's daily work

378
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,540
are spending half as much

379
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,270
I'm remediating security issues compared

380
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,250
to companies that are not doing this

381
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:23,670
okay so that sounds like a good thing

382
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,350
half as much time spending a remediating

383
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,120
security issue so either they have fewer

384
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:31,649
issues or they fix them faster either

385
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,559
way it's good from the White House

386
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:37,620
security application security so and you

387
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,320
can read that they said organizations

388
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,928
that successfully embed security into

389
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,000
DevOps experienced a 50% drop in their

390
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:48,270
protection production vulnerabilities

391
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,820
and their time to fix improves by 25% so

392
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:54,240
fewer vulnerabilities in production and

393
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,799
they fix them faster you sound like good

394
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,910
things I don't know I looked at the

395
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,049
screen I don't have the slides here

396
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:02,610
that's why I keep turning around the

397
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:05,370
DevOps handbook it says in

398
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,649
high-performing organizations quality

399
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,270
availability and security aren't the

400
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,120
responsibilities of individual

401
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:16,379
departments but are a part of everyone's

402
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:19,379
job everyday ok so maybe we do want it

403
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,340
to be everyone's job and you might be

404
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,679
thinking oh I know what's going on here

405
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,668
this is a DevOps talk isn't it or maybe

406
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:33,120
it's a dev setups talk it's not it's not

407
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:37,620
it's not exactly it's not what you think

408
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,709
I probably however I have been reading

409
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,809
this book and I recommend that you read

410
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,940
the first several chapters of this book

411
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:46,860
after the first several chapters it goes

412
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,490
into like how do you it's like

413
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,110
implementation details and it's only I

414
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,270
mean you should probably read that too

415
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,840
but the first few chapters really hit

416
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:59,940
home for me in terms of how software is

417
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,699
delivered the things that get in the way

418
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:07,140
security and how to get out of the way

419
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,500
so it's really good and I really

420
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,970
recommend you read it and you can go

421
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,830
back to Anna plinth appendix where it

422
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:18,780
talks about the talk from 2012 okay so

423
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,780
let's think about why DevOps or let's

424
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,700
talk about why DevOps

425
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,100
this is the situation that DevOps arose

426
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,870
out of right you have developers on one

427
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,699
side and you have operations on the

428
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,668
other side and there's a wall in between

429
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,250
the developers write their code they

430
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:37,140
bundle it up maybe in like a jar file or

431
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,320
something and then they say okay

432
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,230
operations deploy it and run it and if

433
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,129
it falls over you get paged this is like

434
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:50,070
the core of like how DevOps sprung out

435
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,510
right through it and the term is you

436
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,590
know they threw the code over the wall

437
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:57,840
to operations you could also think about

438
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,928
QA the same way developers write the

439
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,649
code bundle it up in some way send it to

440
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:06,240
QA QA tests it and then you know maybe

441
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,179
they send stuff back over the wall back

442
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,500
over to the developers

443
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,850
I think DBA team similar a DBA team I

444
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,309
needed a new database hey I need to

445
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,949
change a table can you do this for me

446
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:26,190
let me open the ticket now it's your

447
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:27,559
responsibility app set isn't it exactly

448
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,030
the same

449
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,629
hey-up SEC team I wrote some code can

450
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,620
you review it

451
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,610
hey app SEC team I have this idea or you

452
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,780
know we're gonna implement this feature

453
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:42,059
can you just give me your security stamp

454
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:44,970
like just stamp it and then move on

455
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,200
right and I experienced this and I

456
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,010
started getting like a little bit

457
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,600
annoyed because I realize that

458
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,840
developers weren't coming to me because

459
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,250
they went oh this is a generalization

460
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,299
but I started to feel like they weren't

461
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,730
coming to me because they wanted to

462
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:02,340
learn about security they just wanted to

463
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:08,460
say the security team said this was okay

464
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm gonna do it now so again just

465
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,340
throwing it over the wall to OPSEC it's

466
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,580
exactly the same situation exactly the

467
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:22,939
same so let's talk about the problem

468
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:25,470
with walls you can't see through a wall

469
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,080
at least not this wall that I've put

470
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,030
here with bricks made out of bricks you

471
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,280
can't see through the wall and that's a

472
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,658
problem if if I'm working on a team and

473
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,210
you're working on a team and I can't see

474
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,570
what you're doing there's a disconnect

475
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,570
right

476
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,040
there's a problem of nonlocality

477
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,610
right if I'm over here and you're over

478
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,139
there

479
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:51,340
you're a developer you're writing code

480
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:53,620
and then you say hey AB SEC person can

481
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,080
you review this can you give me your

482
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,489
opinion etc well I'm all the way over

483
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,100
here on the other side of the wall I

484
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:02,710
don't have the context to actually give

485
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,260
you good advice in a lot of cases not

486
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:08,620
every case but again in in my world here

487
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,660
right there's a problem with

488
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,389
inconsistency I don't think this is as

489
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:17,620
big of an issue for security but well a

490
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:19,810
little bit right so oh I ran my tests on

491
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,870
my machine they asked I gave it to you

492
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:25,270
they don't pass well the problem is of

493
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,939
course we're divided by this wall we're

494
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,340
not in the same place things over here

495
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,810
are different than things over there

496
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,429
from a security perspective you might be

497
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:36,129
like well I looked on it I looked at the

498
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,480
staging server everything was cool but

499
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,890
in production there's a security issue

500
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,330
why because the environments are

501
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:45,990
different it's the same same problem

502
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:48,370
walls also cause long feedback cycles

503
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,790
throw it over the wall you wait for it

504
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:56,189
come back right the wall you could think

505
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:59,830
of the wall as JIRA right or maybe your

506
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,810
in-house ticketing system right you open

507
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,100
a ticket you wait you have no idea

508
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,300
what's happening over there you don't

509
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,790
know what their process is you don't

510
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,990
know if they're even gonna see it you

511
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,970
don't know what I'm saying get done and

512
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,280
then at some point something comes back

513
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:15,520
to you right and usually that's like

514
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,010
ticket has been assigned to someone and

515
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,360
this creates long feedback cycles and if

516
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:23,170
you know DevOps you know that long

517
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,060
feedback cycles are bad and we don't

518
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,790
want that and the final thing about

519
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,350
walls is this transfer of responsibility

520
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:33,490
that I was talking about right when I

521
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:37,449
throw it over the wall I did my job now

522
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:39,580
it's their job right and as we showed

523
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,990
before there's not enough people on the

524
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,470
other side of the wall to do the job

525
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:46,950
right okay I you probably see where I'm

526
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,950
going with this

527
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,700
so let's think about it again this is

528
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,600
sort of like in the DevOps

529
00:24:51,700 --> 00:25:01,269
Tech's yes how did operations become

530
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:04,840
everyone's job well infrastructure

531
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:06,700
became code right so this you get and

532
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,070
you got it like put yourself in the

533
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:13,840
position of I'm an Operations person

534
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:16,629
someone needs a new server ok maybe I'll

535
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,480
like get a box somewhere I don't know or

536
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,919
like I'm gonna create a VM I don't know

537
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,630
if your Windows maybe you have to like

538
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,340
check out a license from somewhere and

539
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,350
then I'm gonna go through and like click

540
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,590
on things until I get the environment

541
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:32,529
set up those days for most people I

542
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,899
think are gone right it's oh I write a

543
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:36,460
configuration file or I just run some

544
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:38,979
configuration file that's already been

545
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,590
written and it's done and if I want to

546
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,570
change it I can go into a code repo and

547
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,639
I can change it and it's tracked and so

548
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,559
on so on this is of course ideal world

549
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:51,809
but this is the world that we're moving

550
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:54,519
towards I gotta go a little bit faster

551
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:57,549
deployments no longer involve let me

552
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,169
hand you some code and then you're gonna

553
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,899
figure out how to get it on to a machine

554
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:04,750
and it's gonna run right develop

555
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:06,969
deployments are automatic I merge the

556
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:10,269
code it goes out it's deployed or I

557
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:12,309
press a button and it's deployed it

558
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,860
doesn't involve opening a ticket for the

559
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:17,710
operations team if you're doing that

560
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:22,840
you're you're lost right in terms of ite

561
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:24,700
like the world will leave you behind new

562
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,799
environments create on-demand new

563
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,480
services on-demand again not opening

564
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:34,059
tickets for another team to do work

565
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:36,669
right and alerts logged metrics etc are

566
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:39,850
no longer oh the ops team looks at the

567
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:43,630
dashboards right it's generally open to

568
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:46,269
everyone and I want to be careful here

569
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,519
because actually some things you don't

570
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:51,399
need everyone in the company to have

571
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:54,159
access to like logs sometimes they're

572
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,889
sensitive but in general in your IT and

573
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,409
your engineering department people have

574
00:26:56,889 --> 00:27:01,299
access to look at the logs themselves to

575
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,639
receive alerts themselves to set up

576
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:04,930
alerts themselves right and that's how

577
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:07,840
operations has we

578
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:09,430
everyone's job it's not oh I'm putting

579
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,540
something on your plate it's I'm giving

580
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:15,100
you access to do it yourself

581
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,010
QA is everyone's job you know

582
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,719
test-driven development or at least

583
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:23,590
developers write the tests not a

584
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,270
separate QA team tests can be run on

585
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,280
development machines or in an

586
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,470
environment the developer controls not

587
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,510
oh let me ship it off somewhere and

588
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:35,140
someone will run tests and they'll fail

589
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:37,030
because it's not like my environment I'm

590
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,390
setting this up not because I want you

591
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:43,540
to like change how your team's work but

592
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:49,120
I think I'm going somewhere with this

593
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:52,480
okay I'm going somewhere future flags on

594
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,000
for employees you deploy a new feature

595
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,550
it's off for almost everyone but your

596
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,550
employees it's on for everyone just

597
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:03,129
became QA QA just became everyone's job

598
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:06,190
assuming that they're using your product

599
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,600
at work that's kind of cool right like

600
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,290
you've completely flipped it

601
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,389
there's no QA team everyone's QA QA is

602
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,180
everyone's job and it's not because it's

603
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,650
become something extra it's just as part

604
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,620
of your daily work you might run into a

605
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:22,150
bug and then you tell someone fix it

606
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,120
there you open you open a ticket and

607
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:27,910
someone addresses it right or if your

608
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,510
developer you address it yourself okay

609
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:33,370
DBA I you see where I'm going with this

610
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:36,910
it's not let me open a ticket for the

611
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:40,689
DBA team all right

612
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:44,350
so let's talk with all that in mind how

613
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:46,570
does security become everyone's job this

614
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,590
is what I kind of came up with but let

615
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,810
me go back to what I said at the

616
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:53,080
beginning of the talk I just want you to

617
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:56,909
think about this I think in the context

618
00:28:53,080 --> 00:29:01,560
of the things we just said about how QA

619
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:04,330
DBA ops how these became everyone's job

620
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:07,330
how can we use that same idea to make

621
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:09,340
security everyone's job and this is what

622
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:12,149
I came up with in terms of what has to

623
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:15,220
happen to the application security work

624
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,080
first of all well it needs to be one of

625
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,890
these three things needs to happen for

626
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,800
any

627
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:23,530
particular piece of work it needs to

628
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,080
disappear I'll go through these I'll go

629
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,160
through suggestions about maybe how this

630
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,810
could happen but it needs to disappear

631
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,910
right it needs to be something that just

632
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:34,690
like no one's thinking about anymore it

633
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:36,820
just happens or it needs to be something

634
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:41,590
that's just integrated into development

635
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:43,860
normal everyday work right or three it

636
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:47,439
needs to be something that is actionable

637
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,360
alerts or actually I like Tania's point

638
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,850
this morning where there's an alert but

639
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,350
then some action automatically happens

640
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:59,080
and I don't even have to do anything

641
00:29:53,350 --> 00:30:01,540
that's also good sorry that's better but

642
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,399
the point is okay so either I don't

643
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,110
worry about it or it's something I

644
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,690
always do it's just part of my work and

645
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,370
not additional it's just part of how I

646
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:11,170
do my job

647
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,520
or it's something you know okay when it

648
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,310
hits production or something it becomes

649
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,320
an alert and I like take action all

650
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:21,250
right let's go through these these are

651
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,169
just suggestions again I'm not trying to

652
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,970
give you a prescription on how to do

653
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:29,920
this I'm just trying to get the wheels

654
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:32,740
turning on how we solve this OPSEC rind

655
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,200
which I'm just personally kind of tired

656
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,990
of if you're not tired of it and you

657
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,460
love it then you're okay but I think

658
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:44,430
we'll all get to the point where we

659
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:47,290
realize this just isn't working okay

660
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:50,770
disappearing security automated

661
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:54,389
dependency updates this is like this is

662
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:57,760
now reality right and I know there's

663
00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:00,280
there's downsides this but really why

664
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,290
don't we just update all the time it's

665
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,680
better in the long run to update all the

666
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,000
time

667
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,980
it's like shipping code all the time

668
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,300
it's a little bit of pain all the time

669
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:14,190
as opposed to outlet stop everything for

670
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:19,180
like several days to do updates right

671
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:22,270
let's just update all the time if you

672
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:24,400
are deploying to some kind of system how

673
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:26,110
come every time I deploy I don't just

674
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,950
have a brand new environment that's

675
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:31,429
fully patched now if you're familiar

676
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,160
with develops this will not spray

677
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:37,370
you but you have to have like a really

678
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,410
good test suite to get to this point

679
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,889
right you have to be confident that when

680
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:46,390
I went night my tests pass everything's

681
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,390
working then you can do these things

682
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,159
security needs to be built into our

683
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:56,240
frameworks in our libraries and I would

684
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,950
encourage you if you are at a company

685
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,510
and you're like yeah yeah we we have

686
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,160
like our own libraries we have our own

687
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:03,170
patches that we put for the framework

688
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,840
contribute if it's you're using

689
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,970
open-source contribute it back right

690
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,530
share it with everyone so that not

691
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:14,060
everyone has to go and do the same

692
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:16,310
things that you've done API is that are

693
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:19,970
secure by default it's I know this

694
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:22,399
sounds silly okay but the transformation

695
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,990
of going from we have stuff that's

696
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,540
unsafe and you have to make sure you

697
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:29,600
call it in the safe way to hey when you

698
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,760
call this it's just safe and if you want

699
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,889
to do it the unsafe way it's really hard

700
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,710
maybe impossible and also it'll get

701
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:39,650
flagged in our code review etc it's just

702
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,780
a it's a total transformation and it

703
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,580
becomes it just disappears oh I don't

704
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,990
have to worry about I call the API I

705
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,110
know someone's thought about security

706
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:52,820
and the way I call it is going to be

707
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:54,260
safe sort of the same thing but

708
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,240
environments that are secure by default

709
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,900
if I'm deploying to a server

710
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,880
I expect that someone else has figured

711
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:07,370
out how to do the infrastructure in the

712
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:14,540
platform so that it's secure this was a

713
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:16,189
tweet from September it says so this

714
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,649
just happened a bot found a

715
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:21,260
vulnerability in a dependency a bot sent

716
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,900
a PR pull request to fix it the CI

717
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,610
verified the pull request a bot merged

718
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,410
the pull request and then a bot

719
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:32,240
celebrated the merge with a gif

720
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:33,590
down here if you go and find this tweet

721
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,130
there were some people that were not as

722
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:40,040
positive about this as I felt and

723
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:43,040
obviously this person felt but Wow

724
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,760
like this is work that disappeared it's

725
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,970
it's visible but

726
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,110
had to manually do it it just worked it

727
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:55,440
just happened

728
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:57,659
pendency was updated done alright if we

729
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,780
can't make it disappear how can we

730
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:05,130
integrate it into people's work

731
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:06,809
I think code reviews just include like a

732
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,550
security checklist that people are

733
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:10,949
trained on and I think the

734
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,320
recommendation is like I don't know four

735
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:16,500
to eight things you can you can pick out

736
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,450
the top ones right things being escaped

737
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,429
properly authorization and

738
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:25,080
authentication etc whatever makes sense

739
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:26,909
for your organization so developers

740
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,250
doing I hate the term threat modeling

741
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,560
but doing threat modeling on their own

742
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,810
not saying oh this is the security

743
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,570
team's job do you think of all these

744
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:39,299
things well go back to the wall right

745
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,190
like if the security teams over there

746
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,379
and development teams over here and

747
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,790
you're saying hey can you look at this

748
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:49,859
and come up with ways that it's insecure

749
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,770
okay well let me like download the

750
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:54,389
entire context of what you're building

751
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,879
what the like it doesn't make sense

752
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:59,190
right development teams should be doing

753
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,950
this themselves and as security

754
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,859
professionals we can help them learn how

755
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:09,060
to do so security tests in the test

756
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:11,310
suite security scans being automated or

757
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,700
at least on-demand if possible but

758
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:17,600
preferably automated on every at this

759
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:22,020
point pray like every poll request is

760
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,310
sufficient and I want to make a I know I

761
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,850
already said this but I wanted to make a

762
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:30,119
special note about code review and this

763
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:31,890
is this is in the DevOps handbook and I

764
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:37,710
like I've read it was like oh yeah of

765
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:39,810
course code should be peer reviewed apps

766
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:42,930
tech team is not peers of the developers

767
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,759
in the sense of like working on the same

768
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:48,899
team working on the same codebase being

769
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,270
familiar with the context and that yeah

770
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,730
that's what that says so we need to

771
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:56,130
enable developers to be doing security

772
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,980
as part of their regular code review

773
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,810
when you're looking

774
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,020
let's say a pull request and you have to

775
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:04,570
get approval from someone normally it's

776
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:07,030
someone on your team right to merge it

777
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,560
well security should just be a part of

778
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,810
what they're glancing through when they

779
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,930
look at that and you know again to go

780
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:16,859
back to remember to the picture of 96

781
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:19,480
developers for security or OPSEC people

782
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:21,369
of course we can't review every code

783
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,950
change but every code change should be

784
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:26,320
reviewed by who by their peers the

785
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:28,149
people on their team so we just have to

786
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,970
introduce security into that process and

787
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,349
then we're done for the most part I mean

788
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,970
what are you really going to catch as an

789
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:35,859
application security person that a

790
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,078
senior engineer on a team isn't if

791
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:41,790
they're given the resources right

792
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,790
they're gonna probably do a better job

793
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,760
all right

794
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,790
security alerts okay they have to be

795
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,589
actionable they need to not go to the

796
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:56,529
security team security team should

797
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:57,759
probably be copied but it should be

798
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,890
going to the people who can affect

799
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,920
change who understand the context that's

800
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:08,618
the developers okay let's go back to

801
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,190
this list and I want to give you an

802
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:14,710
example of of a way of taking this list

803
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:18,310
of responsibilities and making it not

804
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:21,430
the app sect team's responsibility this

805
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:23,349
is just an example I'm if you say if you

806
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,730
look at this and you say Justin that's

807
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:30,640
stupid and it's not gonna it's just an

808
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:32,619
example just an idea all right so this

809
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,900
is taking things from that list and

810
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:37,240
figuring out what teams it actually

811
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,910
makes sense for those responsibilities

812
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,669
to live with as we talked about

813
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:46,960
reviewing designs code changes adding

814
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:49,329
tests doing threat modeling even looking

815
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:55,630
at tool results in bug bounties that's

816
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:57,670
kind of actually developers team job now

817
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:01,030
I know that looking at tool results and

818
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,380
looking at bug bounty results we don't

819
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,930
really want to just dump that on

820
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,579
developers but again we're thinking

821
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,990
we're talking about the future here

822
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:11,910
let's imagine it's a better world and

823
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,339
we are able to pass those results

824
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,470
directly to developers maybe with help

825
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:21,180
right not just like here this is your

826
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:22,500
job now but like hey like okay let me

827
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,598
back up and talking about where I'm

828
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:29,250
coming from with this somebody has to

829
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:32,369
look at these results are you going to

830
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:34,320
take as the OPSEC team and read all of

831
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:36,510
these result like you're gonna run out

832
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,260
of time right so we have to figure out

833
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,940
how to spread this work around okay

834
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,710
Automation of tools security alerts

835
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,290
secure libraries if you have like a

836
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,030
platform's a developer tools team and

837
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,410
infrastructure team it can be called

838
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,150
different things that's where that

839
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,879
should live right those are the experts

840
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:57,089
in those areas incident management

841
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:02,130
please let an incident management team

842
00:38:57,089 --> 00:39:03,630
manage incidents please I don't know we

843
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,750
can outsource training of developers and

844
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:09,030
doing pin tests now there's a key point

845
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,040
that is not on the slide this does not

846
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,800
mean you say okay developers this is

847
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,509
your job now I think a better idea is

848
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,369
why don't we take someone who has upset

849
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,710
expertise and put them on that team

850
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:25,619
maybe temporarily but the mountain

851
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,330
platform hey I want to I want to

852
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,400
understand how we're writing tools how

853
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,960
we're automating things and I have some

854
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,660
things I want to automate can I join

855
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,950
your team for a little while and don't

856
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,810
join the incident management team but

857
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,549
we're gonna help and outsourcing of

858
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:42,839
course you don't have to outsource but

859
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:46,170
what I found is I like I like doing

860
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,580
training I like training people I don't

861
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,680
know that I'm good at it but I like

862
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,529
doing it and I never felt like I had

863
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,899
enough like I need like a month to sit

864
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,400
down and do a nice training course right

865
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,500
there's a reason the training courses

866
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,390
cost so much it's a lot of time and

867
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,980
effort to put material together and I

868
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,540
never felt like even though I enjoyed

869
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,490
doing it that I was giving developers

870
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,589
the training they really needed and

871
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,348
deserved at the quality level they

872
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:11,940
deserved so again this is just trying to

873
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:15,150
figure out what things as a knapsack

874
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,040
team actually have to do this next slide

875
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,480
is not the things that I think the OPSEC

876
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,800
team needs to do it's just the things

877
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,410
that were left from the list because I

878
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,390
want to be honest with you these are the

879
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,970
two things that I left

880
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:29,250
triaging results from pin tests and

881
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,359
creating security champions well of

882
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,270
course you can't really outsource

883
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,730
creating security champions but if you

884
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,370
are embedded on different teams your

885
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,410
presence will help create security

886
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,940
champions actually I don't like security

887
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:47,299
champions because I think everyone

888
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:50,010
should be a security champion right and

889
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,110
again I feel like maybe dumping pin test

890
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:54,150
results on people well I know people are

891
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,320
sensitive about that so we need to

892
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,960
figure out a better way I don't have a

893
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:04,860
solution but if you do again the talk is

894
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:07,560
to get you thinking okay let's bring it

895
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:11,340
all kind of back together here my

896
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,650
proposal is that we should not have AB

897
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:16,050
SEC teams okay if you if that hasn't

898
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:19,110
come through already that's the proposal

899
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:22,290
that we should not have a team called

900
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:25,950
the AB SEC team like we should not have

901
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:27,810
a team called the QA team okay I know

902
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,419
some companies still do I was at

903
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:31,860
synopsis we had a QA team and I can tell

904
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,510
you the process was just was talking

905
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:38,790
about it is awful right it doesn't make

906
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:41,610
sense because as soon as you say this is

907
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:45,029
the ab SEC team it becomes that team's

908
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:48,870
responsibility to do app SEC right and

909
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:52,230
that's just wrong with at least if you

910
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,759
agree with my hypothesis here the app

911
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:55,260
site team should not be the team that's

912
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,190
doing ab SEC thing you can't put it on a

913
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,770
team if it doesn't work in the long term

914
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:05,850
again or think we're talking future it

915
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:07,259
doesn't work it doesn't scale it doesn't

916
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:11,160
actually get us where we want to be

917
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:14,970
which is shipping code faster and more

918
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:17,970
securely so this is what I think this is

919
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:21,589
just my opinion it's just what I've been

920
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,589
thinking about for the last couple years

921
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:27,990
we need to get rid of the OPSEC team and

922
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:31,170
what does it need to be well we have to

923
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:33,870
distribute it and that doesn't mean hey

924
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,910
this is your job now right it's taking

925
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,080
something and inverting it think about

926
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:41,069
operations

927
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,930
if if if if operations said hey

928
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:47,010
developers actually you're gonna build

929
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:49,500
your servers now good luck you're gonna

930
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:52,590
like go find a box and you're gonna like

931
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,780
install the operating system and you're

932
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,550
gonna check the boxes and know that

933
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,670
doesn't work of course not what happened

934
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:02,640
was we changed the way that we provision

935
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:06,960
servers and now everyone can do it for

936
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,129
themselves you know to some extent so

937
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,770
that's what I'm talking about when I'm

938
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,330
talking about distributing OPSEC it's

939
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,670
thinking about how do we turn this

940
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,890
around so that actually everyone can do

941
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,270
it okay

942
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,770
getting ahead of myself of course we

943
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,810
have to automate automate everything

944
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:26,670
that you can anything that can be

945
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:29,400
automated automated I don't think that

946
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,900
that's controversial and then the last

947
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,330
point here OPSEC must be democratized

948
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:37,350
and I don't mean that everyone gets to

949
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:39,120
vote about app sack what I mean is the

950
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:41,850
same as what I said before it where it's

951
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:46,020
everyone has access to it everyone can

952
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:47,790
run scans see results as Nathan

953
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,950
mentioned in earlier in his talk look at

954
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,180
bug boundary reports incoming bug binary

955
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,600
reports everyone can look at them

956
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,970
everyone can see the alerts everyone has

957
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:02,210
access to that information and can do

958
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:05,580
that work that's democratizing the work

959
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:06,420
contrast that to there's a security team

960
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,730
over there

961
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,430
they run the tools they have access to

962
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:13,290
the reports they get the alerts and if

963
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:15,540
they need me I'll be over here they can

964
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:17,570
open a ticket right we're trying to get

965
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:22,220
away from that that's what I mean by

966
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:24,930
democratizing okay

967
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:28,649
just a reminder because I wanted to make

968
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:31,470
sure we got this to make this work

969
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:33,930
OPSEC work needs to either disappear we

970
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,819
need to just figure out a new way of

971
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,540
doing it or it needs to be integrated

972
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,950
into developers daily work poll requests

973
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,500
are an excellent way to integrate things

974
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,480
into an excellent place to integrate

975
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,820
things into a developer's daily work but

976
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,490
you think about it like how QA became

977
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,990
daily work I write code I write tests

978
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,220
for it

979
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,859
it's just part of my job now that's what

980
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,620
I do and and they're better for it

981
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,420
or three needs to be some kind of

982
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,790
actionable alerts that happen

983
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:06,330
automatically and go to the correct

984
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:09,990
people which is not usually the security

985
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:12,870
team okay a couple things I just want to

986
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:19,169
encourage you to do to help get to this

987
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:21,480
future the people in this room have the

988
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:24,780
security expertise that is needed in

989
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:29,130
things like web frameworks in libraries

990
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:32,040
I don't want to see another new hot web

991
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:34,770
framework that's completely missing all

992
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,259
the security controls that we've built

993
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,780
up and refined over the last however

994
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:43,650
many years that needs to stop happening

995
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:46,230
and the way it stops happening is for us

996
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:49,890
to get involved right oh this is cool

997
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:51,180
great uh do you have HTML escaping in

998
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,779
your templating library that you're

999
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,720
using

1000
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,790
do you have parametrized queries do you

1001
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,490
have C surf protection C surf protection

1002
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:02,130
built-in is like you have to have that

1003
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,990
now that you can't call yourself a real

1004
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:06,090
web framework without having that built

1005
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,560
in and automatic where developers don't

1006
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:12,870
worry about it

1007
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:16,980
etc and then the second point is look

1008
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:23,069
developers they still are not receiving

1009
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:25,800
the information okay and I think when I

1010
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,120
look at security resources and I'm not

1011
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,520
thinking about anything in particular

1012
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,680
with just the times that I have gone to

1013
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,350
look for security resources I feel like

1014
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,200
this is not really like developer

1015
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:39,710
friendly this is not approachable frames

1016
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,120
by someone who doesn't already know

1017
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:45,420
what's going on with whatever the

1018
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:47,940
security thing is so I encourage you in

1019
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:51,570
whatever way you can or you feel

1020
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,250
comfortable please contribute that's how

1021
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,840
we're gonna be able to get to this kind

1022
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,970
of future without saying okay we need a

1023
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,460
team of people with this expertise

1024
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:03,080
because no one else can figure this

1025
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:07,460
stuff out all right

1026
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:15,350
I think I think I have like beaten this

1027
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:17,240
enough but I this is again just what

1028
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:20,089
I've been thinking about and kind of the

1029
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,250
frustration point that I reached and you

1030
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:24,140
know I I left SurveyMonkey because my

1031
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,820
company was acquired by synopsis and I

1032
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:30,049
wouldn't worked at synopsis and I wasn't

1033
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:31,970
doing security and but at the same time

1034
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:34,520
I was like you know I'm really just kind

1035
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:36,649
of tired of I feel like I'm just on this

1036
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,540
treadmill and I I don't have the time to

1037
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:41,660
do the things that I want to do to

1038
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,490
really make an impact security wise and

1039
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,250
I think part of that's because we're

1040
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:48,259
doing it wrong in some way right and I

1041
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,900
hope that this has encouraged you to

1042
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:53,000
think about how you're doing security or

1043
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,400
how your company is tool it let's not

1044
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,190
you but how your company is doing

1045
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,880
security right and how your friends are

1046
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:04,100
doing security and how they're wrong and

1047
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,280
think about like okay what are the

1048
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:11,210
fundamental changes we can make not just

1049
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:14,510
that our company but in the industry to

1050
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:17,060
fix this and then you can come back and

1051
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,710
give a talk on how you did that and how

1052
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:22,490
