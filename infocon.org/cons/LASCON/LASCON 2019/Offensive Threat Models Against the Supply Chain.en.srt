2
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,800
thanks guys let's just dive right in a

3
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,679
lot of my background really lends to

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,839
having lived you know a long life in IT

5
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,010
and development sysadmin and networking

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,800
and sock life so now fast forward to

7
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,099
today in terms of more sophisticated

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,069
attacks against target entities and one

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,540
of which is the supply chain vehicle

10
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,540
right and so we're going to talk about

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,030
today is an approach that leverages a

12
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,460
risk centric approach for building a

13
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,330
threat model against you name it you

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,520
know if you're part of an organization

15
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,539
you really have a flagship application

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,220
if you have a line of business and you

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,070
want to be able to understand what are

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,200
the the supply chain dependencies that

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,539
you have that you maybe haven't factored

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,869
into your threat model this is what

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,990
we're talking about today is to build an

22
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,000
offensive threat model to thinks more

23
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,949
criminalistics if you will against your

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,530
own application your own environment

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,149
your own business so just defining

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,830
supply chain you know there's a lot of

27
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,899
things that really translate to supply

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,060
chain you know there's obviously from a

29
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,830
technology sense we have software we

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,600
have embedded components compiled

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:53,520
binaries you know compiled code we have

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,800
code off-the-shelf I mean there's a lot

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,410
of different things but what we also

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,270
need to consider services and recently

35
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,390
in the news I mean everyone's heard

36
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,280
about the Nord VPN hack and you know

37
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,500
there's there's some you know service

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,720
related components there that they were

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,670
sleeping on that allow them to be in the

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,170
situation they're in and I think this is

41
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,250
a common situation that we're gonna see

42
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,260
more and more because as organizations

43
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,970
close the front doors so to speak on

44
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,410
their application environments you know

45
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,780
you got to think about as a criminal you

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,480
got to think about those side doors or

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,030
other ways in to basically have more of

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,690
a sophisticated way into the environment

49
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,370
maybe for a longer term play attack play

50
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,680
that's a little bit more sophisticated

51
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,690
in nature and we're going to we're going

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,020
to go through an example with one of the

53
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,630
major infrastructure players in the

54
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,380
United States and

55
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,540
now for those of you have who are

56
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,280
familiar either from a consumer side or

57
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,560
maybe as an employee or maybe as a

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,420
manager you know operations let's take a

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,090
look at this you know figure here of an

60
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,519
operational model and you know as in

61
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,560
operations you know first of all I

62
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,780
talked earlier on about a risk centric

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:11,090
approach and let me just quickly define

64
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:13,340
that risk is a result of threat times

65
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,430
the probability of that threat times a

66
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,500
weakness times a level of impact over a

67
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,570
sense of a countermeasure or something

68
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,180
to you know withstand some of the

69
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,700
navigate negative aspects of an attack

70
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,530
pattern or something like that so when

71
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,720
we talk about risk we have to understand

72
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,000
an impact and weakness and vulnerability

73
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,730
and threat mode is and probability

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,830
otherwise we're just unilaterally just

75
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,690
using one thing like a weakness and say

76
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,610
and we can we carry that weakness and

77
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,500
say we have a problem here when you

78
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,810
don't factor in things like you know

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,340
probability and stuff like that so let's

80
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,170
look at an example here of an operation

81
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,900
center though you could you know in this

82
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,609
fictitious example you know in order to

83
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,740
do a risk centric threat model you might

84
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,610
have someone that is trying to

85
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,260
understand you know you want to

86
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,990
understand what is the impact that this

87
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,790
operational Center has and in terms of

88
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,770
as a pain point you even want to do that

89
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,010
as a criminal you want to do that as an

90
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,690
offensive adversarial actor because you

91
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,230
know for different reasons for example

92
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,240
let's say that we're all dissidents of a

93
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,298
company where we're angry at a company

94
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,250
for whatever reason and we want to hit

95
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,858
him where it hurts right it's a tactical

96
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,170
plan to do that so you want to be able

97
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,719
to understand what are the high impact

98
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,790
scenarios for that operations whether it

99
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,680
be an application or a broader set of

100
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,630
operations so you have someone here that

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,040
says hey you know I'm kind of concerned

102
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,040
about some of the information that we

103
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,600
manage and this operational model and I

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,730
want to make sure I don't know if we

105
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,620
really are keeping ourself secure and

106
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,970
then from a continuity side you know

107
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,890
supply chain if you think about like

108
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,970
Walmart and think about like Amazon and

109
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,349
you think about other major retailers

110
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,330
global players or even like human

111
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,770
resource service models like Capgemini

112
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,870
right there that's the supply chain

113
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,919
aspect they're you know involved in so

114
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,740
many different types of

115
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,720
Process Outsourcing you you want to

116
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,760
think about you know availability

117
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,470
availability of not just services but

118
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,030
also humans what about if you you know

119
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,970
have to consider things like pandemics

120
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,559
or deliberate types of advanced attacks

121
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,850
against humans you know terrorist

122
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,070
attacks and stuff like that so that

123
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,260
basically factors in the impact

124
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,120
assessment approach right it factors in

125
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,860
like what where do you want to hit our

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,210
target you know what's gonna make them

127
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,610
hurt

128
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,549
from a defensive side you know you know

129
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,720
when we're looking at threat models

130
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,810
here's a common question and this is the

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,600
question that actually got Nord is like

132
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,250
what is my attack surface right and the

133
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,170
the details around that which has been

134
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,330
made public is that you know there's

135
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,480
there's disparate infrastructure

136
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,930
worldwide that that particular b2c

137
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:53,870
company had and they basically had some

138
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,210
infrastructure that was run by a third

139
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:59,090
party and it was poorly managed and run

140
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,849
and so understanding your attack surface

141
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,799
of locations of networks of components

142
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,630
you know as we look at the shaded

143
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,220
background here you know this is an

144
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,159
operation centers we have shipping

145
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,620
trucks pull up their scanner guns that

146
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,230
you have Wi-Fi network so you have you

147
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,000
know local servers that are basically

148
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,970
maybe like printing labels maybe that

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,450
that has a local database of personal

150
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,550
information so whereas we're exploring

151
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,520
this idea of an offensive threat model

152
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,170
we need to look at this environment in a

153
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,760
more criminalistics senses like what do

154
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,470
i what do i want to get out of this do i

155
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,599
want to make sure that they don't that i

156
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,720
hit them where it hurts where as it

157
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,490
relates to their service delivery maybe

158
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,000
availability or do i want to compromise

159
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:47,090
some of their data obviously the

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,510
inherent issue of security you know this

161
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,580
guy who is maybe the IT admin who maybe

162
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,890
has some concerns about the attack

163
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,560
surface is you know trying to understand

164
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,539
what do i not only what do i run but

165
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,389
what is the inherent configuration of

166
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,389
the systems and network services

167
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,069
and technology that I'm using so from a

168
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,250
supply chain standpoint you know there's

169
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:13,580
the the easy low-hanging fruit of

170
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,229
default anything right I've been to a

171
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,000
lot of different let's talk about health

172
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,620
care for a second you know a lot of

173
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,889
healthcare organizations outsource their

174
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,449
IT right hot you talking about night

175
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:26,030
healthcare systems hospital systems and

176
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:28,219
so you'd have an aspect of you have IT

177
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,979
service providers that are configuring

178
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:34,430
managing everything from you know towers

179
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,930
the laptops but also equipment so all

180
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,490
these things have credentials all these

181
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,990
things have services all these things

182
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:44,180
you know could be reached by some rogue

183
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,219
actor on the network so again we're

184
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,939
getting this offensive threat model

185
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:51,710
mentality and play you know and

186
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:53,300
obviously the the thing you know relates

187
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,460
also to the architecture do we have a

188
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,960
flat architecture we want to consider

189
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,969
all these things when we're doing an

190
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,008
offensive threat model because you know

191
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:02,840
as we introduce you know this kind of

192
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:06,020
proverbial looking shady character into

193
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,270
the picture the right way to do an

194
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,479
offensive threat model is to think from

195
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,979
a criminal standpoint and the reason I

196
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,800
say that's the right way of doing it is

197
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:18,529
because if you you know if you don't ask

198
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,690
yourself the question why what am i

199
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:23,599
protecting and who is likely to get in

200
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,969
then your threat model can just be you

201
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,849
know a kind of a conversation that

202
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:32,870
encompasses threats that don't have the

203
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:35,360
the threat evidence to support it in the

204
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,698
industry that you're in and the type of

205
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,409
information that you manage the type of

206
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:44,088
vertical market that you're in in

207
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:45,319
another factors so you know there's the

208
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:48,800
good thing about threat modeling is that

209
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,720
it can an envelope a lot of these other

210
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,579
activities that we normally do as

211
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,529
security professionals application pen

212
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:58,910
testing you know validating third party

213
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:01,939
applications before they're inputted

214
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:05,000
introduced into a network you know

215
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,550
vulnerability scans etc but the idea

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,149
with what we're talking about today is

217
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,229
to really push this notion of thinking

218
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:14,779
you know there's a lot of different

219
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,710
threats to consider what are the ones

220
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,740
that

221
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:22,130
have threat motors that are supported by

222
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,720
research and you know also let's

223
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,189
understand what is the likelihood of

224
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,399
these threats are happening to your

225
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,950
organization because otherwise you know

226
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,470
from from experience this is what you

227
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,870
know we commonly see is that you see

228
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,550
that a lot of fear-mongering right

229
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,370
yeah I don't know maybe you guys I've

230
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,079
seen you know that security professional

231
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,640
that you know anything that if there is

232
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,890
a new vulnerability and news here today

233
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,180
that comes out there like this this is

234
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,770
what we have to do and they're basically

235
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,660
inside an organization of like a

236
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,860
fortunate thousand and they're saying we

237
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,750
got to do this we have this technology

238
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,270
in place and we got it we gotta patch it

239
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,680
now now now and they lose sight of this

240
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,540
and they lose sight of the motors they

241
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,310
lose sight of the probabilistic analysis

242
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,660
because they don't understand the attack

243
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,250
vector they don't understand their

244
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,980
criminal intent they don't understand

245
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:10,100
what is the overall threat motive that

246
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,959
really propels a sophisticated threat

247
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,899
actors who really want to compromise an

248
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:17,779
application or a business speaking of

249
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:21,770
impacts you know oftentimes insecurity

250
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:24,709
over the past you know 15 20 years I've

251
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,910
been denied II and is security

252
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:29,420
professionals we don't really have a

253
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:32,240
good background and in really

254
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,180
determining impact right our way of

255
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,790
determining impact is if the POC of our

256
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,099
exploit works if we basically got a

257
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,900
shell or we basically were able to pull

258
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,790
back data from a relational database

259
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,410
over you know the web through sequel

260
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,449
injection or something like that then

261
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,000
that's that's enough right there and we

262
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,470
stopped there but what we don't know

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,990
oftentimes is the value of that

264
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,060
information the value of uptime and so

265
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,680
we have to think from a risk centric

266
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,449
approach if you're employing this

267
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,550
technique you know these types of

268
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,040
considerations right you know because I

269
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,930
mean I've literally seen security

270
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,730
professionals go up to a leader and say

271
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,089
hey if we don't do this you know you're

272
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,470
gonna get you know this this this

273
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:15,050
cluster of web servers are gonna get

274
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,029
compromised and and then you know a

275
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,219
business person or a product person

276
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:20,839
might say well why do I care you know

277
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,279
why do I care and someone else has to

278
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,740
really kind of do the math and say well

279
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,660
downtime you know that this all gonna be

280
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,890
down for like you know right now it

281
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,689
would be down for like eight hours and

282
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,279
maybe eight hours

283
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,710
you know compared to the amount of

284
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,250
effort to remediate right and so the

285
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,620
reality is and yet as we see the hacks

286
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,450
du jour breaches du jour every week

287
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,670
whether it be you know Nord or anyone

288
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,320
else we're seeing that you know

289
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,579
businesses or control in the dice you

290
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,750
know they're rolling the dice on

291
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,300
security they're rolling the dice on

292
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,770
privacy but we have to understand when

293
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,140
we're doing a risk centric threat model

294
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:58,100
what is that what is the ultimate impact

295
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,920
right and so let's take a look at a key

296
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,980
step in building a threat model and you

297
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,020
know I like to ask the question you know

298
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,770
that the name threat model has that

299
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:12,560
keyword name threat right and so you

300
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,510
know I like to always ask a threat

301
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,589
modeler or someone like a security

302
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,569
champion that's doing threat modeling

303
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,050
you know what is your list of threats

304
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:25,310
and you know for me I always kind of you

305
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:27,380
know you know get surprised about how

306
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,479
they don't consider what their

307
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,370
application does in the broader context

308
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,860
of the business to the broader context

309
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,290
of the market that they're in and so

310
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,630
it's important to build a threat library

311
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,040
that coincides with those things what

312
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,839
information are you managing what is

313
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,689
your deployment model who are your

314
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,130
supply chain vendors that are supporting

315
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,170
your infrastructure do you have people

316
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,630
processes and technology that are a

317
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,370
third or fourth or fifth parties that

318
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,680
are involved do you know what they do do

319
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,930
you know what act sets do they have to

320
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,319
do you know the issue with going back to

321
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,779
Nord was a remote-access issue poor

322
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,529
credentialing from a very small IT shop

323
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,930
in northern Europe and there wasn't any

324
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:10,279
sort of vetting because you know as

325
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,020
security professionals we look at the

326
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,490
bigger attack surface of things but we

327
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,170
don't think about the supply chain

328
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,980
factor which is now an evolving topic

329
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:20,540
and in our industry along with a threat

330
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,420
library that you can you know come up

331
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,459
with through research and through also

332
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,920
kind of pulling some key figures within

333
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,660
that maybe support the application

334
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,760
developers actually have a really good

335
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,199
understanding about how they would

336
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,089
actually attack their own application

337
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,410
you know because they deal with the

338
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,690
information their application is

339
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,760
managing it's a good to just simply say

340
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,520
how would you what would you do with

341
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,980
this with we

342
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,050
what this application does or if you

343
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,130
wanted to bring it down or if you wanted

344
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,819
to steal information how would you go

345
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,850
about doing it

346
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,500
so it's important to correlate a threat

347
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,170
library which is really easy to do it's

348
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,090
kind of like a brainstorming exercise

349
00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:00,740
with with threat motives and we'll see

350
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,060
why in a second that second has arrived

351
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,830
we are going to look in the next couple

352
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,170
slides on threat sources and threat

353
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,690
Intel and and the one thing that's

354
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,699
missing here is threat data now threat

355
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,250
Intel I characterize as information that

356
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,710
you get from you know experts that are

357
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,420
doing you know threat or risk analysis

358
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,730
at a global level for different types of

359
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,520
industries in this case we see the World

360
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,880
Economic Forum really released this this

361
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,880
analysis on macro geopolitical risk

362
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,950
issues now supply chain attacks are a

363
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,740
little bit more sophisticated than your

364
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:37,200
you know very kind of sniper file sniper

365
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,630
related attacks that are looking for fun

366
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,480
and profit on information compromised IP

367
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:45,180
theft and stuff like that you may still

368
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,400
do a supply chain attack for those types

369
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,739
of goals absolutely you know you may

370
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,010
want to basically you know insert a

371
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,350
component of something malicious in a

372
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,080
broader application or broader appliance

373
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,720
or product for the purposes of IPSS

374
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,090
absolutely but what we're looking at

375
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,370
this here and I apologize for the

376
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,550
faintness of the graph is look at the

377
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,500
purple the orange and the blue in in

378
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,400
simple terms you know the purple really

379
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,250
relates to more technological types of

380
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,480
risks that have been you know assessed

381
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:23,280
and evaluated as top risks for

382
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,420
organizations from the World Economic

383
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,300
Forum now this this day and age there's

384
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,400
a lot of interesting geopolitical issues

385
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,530
that are happening worldwide not only in

386
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,709
this country but abroad as it relates to

387
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:40,470
trade as it relates to economic

388
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,260
development of different economies in

389
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,650
Africa and South America

390
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,200
currency backing currency hedging

391
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:51,000
influencing financial markets all of

392
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,850
these things as you think about the

393
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,570
right supply chain attack you know to

394
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,630
the right

395
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,970
eight target entity New York Stock

396
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,490
Exchange some sort of like you know

397
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:06,540
major impactful company like even Amazon

398
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:10,520
or some Transportation Department of

399
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:13,439
Transportation you know health services

400
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,560
any anything that's critical or that

401
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,620
provides a meaningful impact to

402
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,569
economies then you know you're going to

403
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,760
basically need a more sophisticated hack

404
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,310
of which you need to consider how does

405
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,620
geopolitical risk factors translate to

406
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,810
more sophisticated supply chain attacks

407
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,850
this is from the World Economic Forum

408
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:36,329
this one's from the global risk

409
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:39,270
interconnections report that came out in

410
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,890
2019 and the thing to highlight here are

411
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,640
kind of the boldness of different lines

412
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:48,680
and again focus on the the purple the

413
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,030
orange and and and the blue here and

414
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,130
what's interesting is you know some

415
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,160
obvious things you know cyber attacks as

416
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,620
it relates to an increase in concern to

417
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,170
critical infrastructure which is really

418
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,150
topical - you know supply chains with

419
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,680
the example we're going to look at which

420
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,160
I'm going to basically talk on the US

421
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:12,870
Postal Service so some of the some of

422
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:15,000
the lines connecting the relationships

423
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:16,979
of these diamonds here you know let's

424
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,709
take a look at profound social

425
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,579
instability profound so you look at

426
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:26,040
cyber attacks and it's connected to some

427
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:29,100
of these other diamonds with different

428
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,379
degrees of density of the line but for

429
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,850
supply chain attacks especially for

430
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,090
let's go back to the operational center

431
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:38,459
you know as a let's say I'm a mastermind

432
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,070
for a hacker syndicate employed by a

433
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,680
nation-state then I want to be able to

434
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,230
establish repeat iation I think I had it

435
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,300
in the prior slide and you want to get a

436
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,760
lot of foot soldiers if there is a

437
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,940
profound social instability in a region

438
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,070
in a you know in a country in a region

439
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,810
within a country maybe within an

440
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,939
industry that allows for a recruitment

441
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:03,540
that allows for a collusion that allows

442
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,310
for you know for propagation of or

443
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,430
intelligence gathering OSINT

444
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,280
from from within

445
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,320
all these things help to the criminal or

446
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,990
in an offensive threat model to

447
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,439
basically understand information that

448
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:21,640
they need in order to introduce their

449
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,300
supply chain attack the reason we're

450
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,740
talking about all these different

451
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,850
reporters here's another reporter this

452
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,510
is really interesting looking at the

453
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,830
past ten years you look at 2009 to 2019

454
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,030
what's really interesting with this and

455
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,919
I know you can't see it in the back

456
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,870
there but you know these are kind of the

457
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,770
top five global risks in terms of

458
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,939
likelihood and if you look at here 2007

459
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,460
there was a pretty bad economic

460
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,650
recession globally and and and it was

461
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,560
equally or pretty bad in United States

462
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,140
as well so you see a lot of things that

463
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,810
are financially related fiscal crisis

464
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:56,080
you know asset price collapse one and

465
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:58,720
two and 20 2009 2010 you know as years

466
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,480
go goes by you look at the green right

467
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,670
you know we're at almost a 2020 the

468
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,370
environment is a big topic right fires

469
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:08,740
and and in kind of unpredictable weather

470
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,060
which affects distribution which affects

471
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,550
shipping which affects I mean

472
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,080
transportation you name it manufacturing

473
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,780
farming the list goes on all these

474
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,510
things by the way affects economics so

475
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,120
from a from a criminal more roping in

476
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,810
geopolitical risk factors to you know

477
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,449
how that can create how can that can be

478
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,120
manipulated by a nation-state with the

479
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:33,970
right actors through supply chain is

480
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:39,340
very feasible you see cyber purple pop

481
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:40,870
up here 2018 2014 2012 you know it

482
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,949
starts to basically make the top five

483
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:46,750
and and so the point with the last three

484
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,670
slides is when you're doing threat

485
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,320
modeling it's important to have the

486
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,740
background of what the threat landscape

487
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,230
is and it doesn't really take a lot to

488
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,850
research that and yeah you know we my

489
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,890
opening statement was like a dream of

490
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,419
bankrupting the security industry with

491
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,370
greater automation and you know

492
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,340
artificial intelligence stuff like that

493
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,229
and and there's a lot that you can do

494
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,780
with correlation of data there's a lot

495
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,120
you can do with you know aggregating

496
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,250
massive amounts of data to do regression

497
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,570
analysis and stuff like that but at the

498
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,210
end of the day if you want to be a

499
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,060
really good threat modeler it's it's

500
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,860
really trying to

501
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,919
and you're working for a multinational

502
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,689
company then it's really important to

503
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,750
understand where you fit and how

504
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,360
geopolitical risk factors affect you

505
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,400
just a rope wrap up there on the threat

506
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,199
intelligence side there's these are

507
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,630
obviously more geopolitical risk threat

508
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,540
intelligence this is not your typical

509
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:43,280
apt 41 or apt three types type of threat

510
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,320
intelligence like you might get from

511
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,270
like a mandiant or whatever but you know

512
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,860
here's just additional you know things

513
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,170
that as you're building out your threat

514
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,179
library you know and let's say that you

515
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,390
are in manufacturing and let's say that

516
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,470
you are in you know transportation you

517
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,780
know you want to be able to kind of

518
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,640
consider what are some of the barometers

519
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,600
or what are some of the things that

520
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,250
globally other major companies players

521
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,600
governments are seeing because that

522
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,860
should factor into your mindset when

523
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,159
you're building an offensive threat

524
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:16,939
model alright I promise the sample

525
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,850
threat model kind of overview with the

526
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,650
US Postal Service and here it is some

527
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,959
fun facts about the US Postal Service is

528
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,670
that it's basically handles warm mail

529
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,190
than any other postal service system in

530
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,360
the world retail network is larger than

531
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,420
McDonald's Starbucks and Walmart

532
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,159
combined which is really interesting and

533
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,780
it's the traditionally the last provider

534
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,030
of last mile delivery which basically

535
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,010
means like even players like Amazon are

536
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:43,730
using the US Postal Service to do that

537
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:45,530
last mile delivery so you know as we

538
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,300
think about a threat model for them you

539
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,680
know one of the natural things as

540
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,629
relates to continuity

541
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,990
you know the Postal Service sure has

542
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:56,810
information on citizens it might have

543
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,870
obviously continuity the continuity of

544
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,669
it delivering its services affects the

545
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,199
companies like Walmart like Amazon like

546
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,200
Target that are using it for Laughs

547
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,270
model delivery it also you know affects

548
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,150
you know the government services how

549
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:13,070
much does the government state

550
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:15,230
municipalities use the US Postal Service

551
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,960
to send you know different types of

552
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:20,870
government documents so there's a lot of

553
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,350
things that pass through the US you know

554
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:27,560
Postal Service and you know I mentioned

555
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,330
two particular types of threats that you

556
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,129
know should be in a threat library you

557
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,100
know one is related to affecting the

558
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,710
continuity of it maybe through

559
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,350
type of sabotage attack maybe through a

560
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,630
type of extortion play the US government

561
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,879
you know the US Postal Service's is

562
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,760
autonomous outside of the US government

563
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,530
but they have money to spare if they're

564
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,390
in a situation where some of their key

565
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:54,428
systems are all simultaneously bricks or

566
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,900
components within those systems are

567
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,150
break and they don't have the redundancy

568
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,160
and downtime in days

569
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,530
could equate to you know some level of

570
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,190
financial loss and an actual economic

571
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:08,200
impact for some of its own customers so

572
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,120
that's just playing off of the extortion

573
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,940
play which is one of the threats that

574
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,520
have been superhot you know over the

575
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,220
past couple of years with multiple

576
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,809
different vertical markets so I like to

577
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,610
basically have this over you when I do a

578
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:23,649
threat model this really kind of

579
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,969
captures you know what are the attack

580
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,870
what does the attack surface and you can

581
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,299
get if you're doing an application

582
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,340
threat model you can get as granular as

583
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:33,250
you want you can basically make these to

584
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,959
be an enumerated list of API endpoints

585
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,580
may be of different demons that are

586
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,789
running that are key may be different

587
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,500
batch jobs that are super important

588
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:45,700
server-side operations you know you name

589
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,159
it so let's talk about some of the

590
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,659
components of the US Postal Service now

591
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,330
that I'm going to talk about two one is

592
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:54,190
the delivery bar mail sorters and these

593
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,230
mail sorters and you if you have I don't

594
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,929
know if you remember I had the benefit

595
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,280
of taking actual a tour of some of these

596
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:02,320
facilities and they're quite impressive

597
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,428
I mean they're like much bigger than a

598
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,610
football field and you have these

599
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:07,720
massive machines that are just

600
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,809
pumping through you know different

601
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,000
parcels catalogs you know you know eight

602
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:15,520
by eleven you know the old boxes and

603
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,320
everything and then all systematically

604
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,480
you'd have these sorters to basically

605
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,389
sort where things go you know and it's

606
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,789
amazing it's it's it's what's really

607
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:28,960
amazing is that you have this downtime

608
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,780
requirement if like if something stops

609
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,870
you have ten minutes before you go to

610
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,700
the next seven levels and and so you

611
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:39,129
know that here is the kind of a

612
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,390
blueprint of one of their other kind of

613
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,340
products that they use is called the

614
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:44,890
advanced face or cancellation systems

615
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,299
pretty fancy name and it's capable of

616
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,179
processing thirty five

617
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:50,589
and pieces of mail per hour like I said

618
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:53,469
you know they haven't escalated downtown

619
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:56,820
of ten minutes I mean these this system

620
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:59,529
here is much bigger than this room and

621
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,869
it basically has all these moving parts

622
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:05,229
chutes and rollers and all these

623
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:07,689
different things and there's they have

624
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:10,179
these PL PLM boards that basically

625
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,009
there's embedded programming into these

626
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,440
boards and that's where the supply chain

627
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:17,589
consideration can come in obviously

628
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,719
right because they and like most other

629
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:21,759
operational places similar to them in

630
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:24,309
terms of warehouse operations that are

631
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,229
not taking the time to vet that third

632
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:28,779
party that is providing the hardware

633
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:30,609
that has that code base so from an

634
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:33,879
offensive standpoint you know thinking

635
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:36,189
about what is the possibility of being

636
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:39,399
able to affect the supply chain to those

637
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:42,459
providers of these types of systems and

638
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:45,158
being able to have a concerted attack

639
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:48,459
that's time-base that affects a major

640
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,200
distribution center and and so that

641
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:52,359
that's that's the concerted effort where

642
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,679
you know even you could you could do

643
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,928
this across multiple different

644
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,599
distribution facilities and really

645
00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:00,339
impact you know mail distribution you

646
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:05,289
know regional at least to the southeast

647
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:07,839
or the Northeast etc now obviously you

648
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:09,279
know that the goal in doing that is let

649
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,190
me get my hands on one of these boards

650
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,139
which is not hard let me actually

651
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,999
understand the code base which also

652
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,738
might not be hard if you're able to

653
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:19,929
reverse it or even get the source from

654
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:21,369
the manufacturer there's many ways you

655
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:24,369
know to do that through social

656
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:26,468
engineering of the company because they

657
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:28,899
want to exemplify you know how good our

658
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:31,359
code is or whatever they want to be able

659
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:33,609
to answer any sort of bogus security

660
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,109
questions related to the code base and

661
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:36,968
so therefore they cough up more than

662
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:38,978
they really need to but you know the

663
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:41,679
traditional aspect of just simply doing

664
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:43,509
VR vulnerability research on compiled

665
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,070
binaries and doing the reversing and

666
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:48,060
seeing if there's some sort of way to do

667
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:50,370
a command injection and then

668
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,040
packaged it up and then you know

669
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:56,219
introduce it back to the to the vendor

670
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,260
for the US Postal Service what is one of

671
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,800
the easiest ways to introduce tainted

672
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:04,470
materials or components is price

673
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,600
discounting so if you're really a smart

674
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,630
adversarial individual or group or

675
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,699
entity you simply you know have an exact

676
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,370
looking product you put your malicious

677
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,140
payload you know after you've basically

678
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,179
decompiled reverse and then infiltrated

679
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,910
the codebase and repackage and you offer

680
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:23,820
it at a complete discount and you know

681
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,920
your end goal is really not you know to

682
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,659
make money on that supply chain aspect

683
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,030
your end goal is the extortion play

684
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:33,390
where it basically you know you're

685
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:35,280
holding the keys to bouncing back to

686
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,930
with with the US Postal Service and

687
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,840
saying here's the corrected you know

688
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:41,370
issue if you want to basically get back

689
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,320
and running within you know X amount of

690
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:48,479
time what's helpful in doing these types

691
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,129
of exercises is building attack trees I

692
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,350
like attack trees some people like hill

693
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,330
chains simply because you build your

694
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,040
threat library that we had earlier on

695
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,290
the presentation and then for each

696
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,530
threat that you have in your library you

697
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:03,720
can build a tree and you know the idea

698
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,370
in a risk centric approach is that you

699
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,710
can take this as far down in multiple

700
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,560
levels is that you basically you know

701
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:13,140
how would sabotage happen for a target

702
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,760
application a target system and how

703
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,620
would that be realized and so you

704
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,690
basically look at well what are the

705
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,729
targets obviously you don't want to

706
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,010
target a component that is going to be

707
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,540
not effect continuity of business so

708
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,379
that would be pretty worthless in terms

709
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:30,629
of a you know strategy so you want to

710
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,840
define the the now now we're thinking

711
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,400
more you know if we're all working for

712
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,679
an organization we need to understand

713
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,090
obviously our attack surface our targets

714
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,010
and we need to see what sort of

715
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,310
associative vulnerabilities or

716
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:46,260
weaknesses are are associated with those

717
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,240
components and then see what the

718
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,220
viability is of different attack

719
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,310
patterns against those weaknesses that

720
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,560
have been identified and and so what

721
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:59,820
this does what the threat model does is

722
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:01,690
it basically embellishes activities that

723
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,639
already happen in most places there

724
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,470
here this is your pen testing and you

725
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,630
know the attack modeling the attack

726
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:09,790
vector of viability analysis just fancy

727
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:13,090
talked for exploitation testing right

728
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:15,100
pen testing and so this is this sees if

729
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,600
something is viable it builds off as

730
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,730
obviously the vulnerabilities that were

731
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,959
detected to see if you know those

732
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,270
vulnerabilities that were found that

733
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,670
were qualified or actually can't

734
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,320
actually be successfully exploited the

735
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,930
good thing about this tree is that these

736
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,290
attacks are supposed to support the goal

737
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:35,110
of the sabotage which is the threat

738
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:37,659
that's in your threat library and this

739
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,399
is really rationale for sharing with you

740
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,590
know different people and operations and

741
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,980
IT operations that are basically

742
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:46,959
responsible for applications and systems

743
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,810
because it provides a very logical kind

744
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,380
of domino effect so the the kind of the

745
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:57,639
the the impact is very clear and the

746
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,460
path of concern is also very clear so

747
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,190
from a kind of adversarial viewpoint

748
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,810
here you know we want to think about

749
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,850
what is our objective from a criminal

750
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,520
sense you know do we want to steal data

751
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:13,149
do you want to do intellectual property

752
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,580
theft and then we basically you know do

753
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,700
our we pick our targets here's a Pitney

754
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,500
Bowes product that is also very embedded

755
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,690
in many warehouse components there's

756
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,570
Honeywell which has multiple different

757
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:28,390
types of products that it has for

758
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,129
modern-day warehouse operations you know

759
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:33,250
with multiple different types of

760
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,440
interfaces from the handsets that are

761
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,380
you know communicating over Bluetooth or

762
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,380
NFC to other systems so the

763
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:46,170
understanding the target selection as a

764
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:48,340
you know the the offense of you know the

765
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,040
individual is is really important as

766
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,030
we're going through this exercise

767
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,409
understand who are the manufacturers

768
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:59,830
that are in play that you want to hit

769
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:01,780
the so you know a lot of Intel you know

770
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,639
this is actually a lot easier than it

771
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,639
seems even from a purely blackbox

772
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,490
perspective because you know oftentimes

773
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,350
as a cyber criminal or even as it's just

774
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,980
kind of a black hat doing and engagement

775
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:17,260
you can a lot of the suppliers or

776
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,780
actually pretty chatty about who they're

777
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,090
in bed with you know and so all these

778
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,639
different people that are quoted here

779
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,928
are pretty easy to you know this one's

780
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,179
actually with the municipality right

781
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:29,559
here or school system here's the

782
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:32,500
department of revenue for the state of

783
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:35,830
Mississippi so you begin to see who's

784
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,630
advert who's advertising their use of a

785
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,210
particular component that maybe you've

786
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:42,340
actually paid $100,000 for a zero-day on

787
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,690
and it's something that relates to a

788
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,850
component and you just want to basically

789
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:49,960
say where does this component fit in my

790
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:52,120
global set of possible targets and so if

791
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,130
you basically are you know again this is

792
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,080
for the criminal you know group if

793
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,820
you're basically out there you're buying

794
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,379
up zero days and you want to weaponize

795
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,850
them you want to be able to shop around

796
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,650
and see where do i weaponize this

797
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:07,629
against this is a tool that we built is

798
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,460
also from a defensive standpoint it's

799
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,750
it's it basically aggregates a lot of

800
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,179
things that are out there just not kind

801
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:17,080
of understand the attack surface exposed

802
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:21,760
api's hardware components different

803
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:24,220
types of human operators as targets as

804
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,510
well you know in order to do collusion

805
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,790
in order to do different types of

806
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,450
perpetration for different types of

807
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:34,720
target if social engineering campaigns

808
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:37,690
and this from from the geopolitical risk

809
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,880
standpoint you better believe that you

810
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,590
know that there are syndicates and

811
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,299
nation-states that are employing these

812
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,189
types of techniques on the regular basis

813
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:47,440
so this is really nothing new for

814
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,929
anybody but what it is this new is

815
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,929
trying to basically put this all into an

816
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:54,700
offensive threat model right is is an

817
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:58,120
offensive threat model where you can

818
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,679
exercise this one of the things about

819
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,830
you know going back to the US Postal

820
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:06,370
Service and other types of US operations

821
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:08,290
such as that warehouse operations is

822
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,510
that there's an implicit trust model

823
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,850
that exists between you know components

824
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,010
not only software components but the

825
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,719
components that are related to third and

826
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:20,799
fourth parties or code off the shelf or

827
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,040
appliances there is and any good IT

828
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,799
person gone bad hence the black spy

829
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,240
versus spy character there would would

830
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,690
be very knowledgeable of that

831
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,890
and so abusing that implicit trust model

832
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:37,870
is already in an inherent kind of

833
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:41,679
low-hanging fruit or gimme if you will

834
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:44,199
for the adversary here we just see some

835
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,450
data flows between you know controller

836
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:50,140
and HMI component and some of the you

837
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:52,270
know an IPC process and and

838
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,070
understanding you know I'm providing

839
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,240
this example because most of the

840
00:33:54,070 --> 00:34:00,428
examples that provided have been a

841
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,410
little bit less on the the the embedded

842
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:04,690
component or the application side this

843
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,550
is more of if you have one application

844
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,440
and you see that it has you know

845
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,840
different components in it you want to

846
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,850
be able to understand how what are what

847
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,200
how is your communication typically

848
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,118
there is some sort of acknowledgment

849
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,589
it's very simple communication but you

850
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,980
want to be able to understand the trust

851
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:23,560
model between these components alright

852
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,940
so we've talked about motive we've

853
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,440
talked about understanding attack

854
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,060
surface we've talked about using

855
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,899
different types of threat intelligence

856
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:33,969
to kind of substantiate a threat library

857
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:35,799
you know now it comes times to really

858
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,168
kind of establishing credibility on

859
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,320
certain types of threats and you know

860
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:42,699
like I said this there's the US Postal

861
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,109
Service has actually been in the news

862
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:49,330
and has had incidents before so here's

863
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:51,639
one from twenty eighteen US Postal

864
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:54,929
Service site expose data for sixty

865
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:58,630
million users they have this fairly new

866
00:34:54,929 --> 00:35:01,960
it's a couple years old products or

867
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:05,320
application called inform delivery it's

868
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,300
been dubbed the stalkers dream so it's

869
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,660
basically a web-based application and it

870
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,100
allows for you know you know for from an

871
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,680
adversarial person to really kind of

872
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,259
find out you know massive amounts of

873
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,589
personal information for those that are

874
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,510
in the USPS system but these things have

875
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,910
been in the news and in the tests and so

876
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:27,250
from a threat modeling perspective if

877
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,810
you've had incidents or if you have

878
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,550
Intel it helps to basically

879
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:33,130
substantiates what's in your threat

880
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,410
library that's the point of really you

881
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,600
know making sure that when you build a

882
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:40,899
threat live library you sustain it with

883
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,890
evidence with research now let's talk

884
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,830
about things from your defense

885
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:47,140
side hence the the white spider spy

886
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:50,560
character is a prescriptive guidance

887
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:53,770
that you can do for using an offensive

888
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,570
threat model from a defensive side is

889
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,890
that it builds context of what you

890
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,950
should really focus on first

891
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:02,710
right so you know most operations in

892
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:04,120
most businesses they say well we need to

893
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,560
have this we need to have all management

894
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,930
we need to have a sock we need to have

895
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,070
you know a sim and this that and the

896
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,649
other and they don't really think about

897
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:14,500
the strategy of it right if you

898
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:17,890
understand the context of threats that

899
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,240
you face as an entity within an industry

900
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,770
because of the data that you have

901
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,049
because of the architecture of your

902
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,759
applications because of the deployment

903
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,710
model because of your supply chain of

904
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,950
your vendors and what they do

905
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:33,490
it adds context and so with that you can

906
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,960
basically wrap your model to govern you

907
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,430
know understanding what does the attack

908
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,740
surface that we need on it what we need

909
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,270
to know and I mention different stages

910
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,740
of pasta if you're interested in pasta

911
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,680
just google pasta and threat modeling

912
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,839
and you'll find some sources and visual

913
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,600
diagrams and stuff like that

914
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:53,680
it also helps from a a white hat

915
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:56,500
perspective to to to do abuse cases that

916
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,850
fulfill threat objectives oftentimes you

917
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,110
know you might actually pay for someone

918
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:01,540
to do a pen test and they're just gonna

919
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:04,140
go full hog based upon what you know a

920
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:07,300
framework might do Metasploit says or

921
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:10,000
canvas says or Halestorm says or you

922
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,950
know whatever and that's not what

923
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,270
criminals do you know criminals are

924
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,620
thinking through what they want our good

925
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,420
criminals were thinking about how they

926
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,630
want to get in and how they want to

927
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,890
establish persistence etc so if

928
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,720
persistence is a threat that you want to

929
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,000
mitigate then think about what are the

930
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,910
components that architectual II don't

931
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,450
have a are most acceptable to fall into

932
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:35,080
that but all these different stages

933
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,910
he'll here helped to define use the

934
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,400
threat model to leverage what

935
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,990
vulnerability is to triage first how the

936
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,520
vulnerabilities relate to that attack

937
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,259
service so that you can build that

938
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:49,090
customized tree and then you know

939
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,130
actually do the type of exploit testing

940
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,110
that provides that variable in the risk

941
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,380
equation which is probabilistic analysis

942
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:57,329
there was a call

943
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,950
of mine I think he's in Minnesota or

944
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:00,990
some like that he had this product that

945
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:04,319
basically what it did it did regression

946
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:06,419
analysis on exploit testing and they he

947
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:09,750
used the regression analysis to

948
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,490
basically qualify the probabilistic the

949
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:14,130
probability of a certain attack to being

950
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:18,569
successful and he sold a product for I

951
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:20,880
don't know who Richard Searson I think

952
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:24,180
is his last name but I worked with him

953
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,349
on a DHS project actually and you know

954
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,200
it was really interesting because it

955
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:29,640
helped to qualify the probability of a

956
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,750
certain attack pattern against an

957
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,450
application or against the system but

958
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:38,930
going back to leveraging a threat model

959
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:41,788
and some prescriptive guidance is

960
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:44,460
there's things that from a risk

961
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:47,150
perspective that go beyond just simply

962
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,410
mitigate preemptive mitigation of loans

963
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,759
reducing an attack surface better

964
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,049
architecture there's things like

965
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:55,170
understanding what it's a business

966
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:57,000
aspect of what the system or application

967
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,910
does you know there might be regulatory

968
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,680
requirements that that alone might be a

969
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,589
business impact to consider there might

970
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,940
be you know legal requirements and so if

971
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:07,769
you look at state the different stages

972
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,730
it kind of walks you through some

973
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:14,490
considerations to to leverage as part of

974
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:17,579
a risk centric approach the final

975
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:20,519
thoughts here's some final thoughts that

976
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:23,640
you know I always I've always been a

977
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,959
kind of a cynic with Gardner and the

978
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,660
reason I'm a cynic was a gardener I have

979
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,640
been because you know there seems to be

980
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,230
a lot of organizations that kind of live

981
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,629
and die there are security programs on

982
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,720
what Gardner says and I'm not you know

983
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:39,930
criticizing that but I you know I I just

984
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,058
wanted to mention this because you know

985
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:44,220
some people you know take credence to so

986
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:45,480
a lot of what the analysts say there and

987
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,970
and this is actually you know pretty

988
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,500
decent one software hardware base supply

989
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,879
chain attacks art art or trending up

990
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,349
this is no surprise to anyone this is

991
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,019
why you know you guys are probably

992
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:58,559
interested in this talk the difference

993
00:39:55,019 --> 00:40:01,078
is is being able to not just you know

994
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,809
run out the door and say supply chain

995
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,220
you know where do I start but to kind of

996
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:09,130
take a step back and form an opinion

997
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,959
of a threat model and then look at that

998
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:15,550
threat model and apply it offensively

999
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,440
against whatever your target is some of

1000
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,720
the risks that we're seeing that are you

1001
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,520
know escalating and changing 2017 saw a

1002
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,990
dramatic rise to supply chain tags for

1003
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,020
the previous year that's 200% increase

1004
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:28,060
so if you don't have supply chain

1005
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,980
attacks you know and the components that

1006
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,690
your supply chain dependencies consist

1007
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,900
of then it probably it's worth

1008
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:37,450
consideration typical attacks cost 1.1

1009
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,280
million physical attack while physical

1010
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,890
attackers can hijack a truck harm a

1011
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,210
driver etc their attacks that my siphon

1012
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,950
on much more than money when they are

1013
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:49,440
discovered the example I use there is

1014
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:52,629
that we see a lot of different cases in

1015
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,810
the forensic analysis that we do where

1016
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:58,119
is IP theft so start up in New York and

1017
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:02,470
even here in Austin or in Silicon Valley

1018
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:04,750
there's nation-states that they their

1019
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:07,990
business plan literally is on IP

1020
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:10,270
compromised for the purposes of getting

1021
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,339
that sort of a competitive advantage

1022
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,830
getting that same company to be

1023
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:18,279
basically launched from that particular

1024
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:20,380
country for economic development so if

1025
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,750
you can steal someone else's IP you're

1026
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,510
completely curtailing the bizdev cycle

1027
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,430
of the software the engineering the

1028
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:29,920
architecture and if you're lucky you can

1029
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:31,720
even get some revenues or target markets

1030
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,910
you can discount and then you can go to

1031
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,310
market so all that have you worked at a

1032
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,470
US company did is basically now being

1033
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:40,240
profited by a nation-state that

1034
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,029
basically is looking to bolster their

1035
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,729
you know economic advancements because

1036
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:48,730
any one idea could be a multi-billion

1037
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:52,710
dollar industry for them well led by one

1038
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,710
player that leads to five other players

1039
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,160
I'm gonna skip this slide real quick and

1040
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,780
I'm just gonna dive into this and say

1041
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,140
you know a lot of people use stripe and

1042
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:05,080
you know this is my basically visual

1043
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,629
representation of stride because it

1044
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:11,799
doesn't really it hasn't evolved it's a

1045
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:16,089
nice acronym to remember to basically

1046
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:19,930
use it makes it simple but simple

1047
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:21,970
acronyms that are gonna be static

1048
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:24,129
encompass a static list of threats

1049
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:26,348
spoofing tampering of data repudiation

1050
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,420
information disclosure in a very dynamic

1051
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:31,809
and ever-changing threat landscape is

1052
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:33,700
pointless in my opinion but um you know

1053
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:35,470
that's why you know I think that you

1054
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,868
know a lot of people that use it are

1055
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,490
gonna be ill prepared and not thinking

1056
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:40,779
outside the box because you better

1057
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:45,819
believe that criminals are very much

1058
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:49,089
thinking outside the box this doesn't

1059
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:51,249
show well on the big screen but there's

1060
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:52,660
basically this process for attack

1061
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:56,980
simulation and threat analysis was

1062
00:42:52,660 --> 00:43:00,940
invented in 2015 and me and Marco Marana

1063
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:04,599
who's an Italian native foreign guy who

1064
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:06,519
was an SVP at Citigroup in London we we

1065
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,220
wanted to basically come up with a

1066
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:10,959
process that you know looked at things

1067
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,779
offensively from an offensive point of

1068
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,980
view whether it be an application or an

1069
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:19,749
entity and try to basically use thread

1070
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,420
base evidence that we see in the

1071
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:24,819
industry to be able to come up with

1072
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,710
define threats associated attacks that

1073
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:27,369
would realize those threats in a very

1074
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,019
linear

1075
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,339
you know methodology and that's what

1076
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:32,979
basically the process for attack

1077
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:35,769
simulation and threat analysis is is is

1078
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,410
it's the risk centric approach to threat

1079
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:41,529
modeling there's a lot of inputs and

1080
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:45,029
outputs related to each stage the great

1081
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:47,710
thing about it is is that it you know it

1082
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:49,390
it's been covered by Carnegie Mellon

1083
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:53,289
Carnegie Mellon the u.s. searched

1084
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:55,239
various universities worldwide HP as

1085
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:59,739
references there's a lot of tools that

1086
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:01,930
reference it as well and so the the main

1087
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:05,109
premise around it is that in security

1088
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,399
there is a lot to cover and there's

1089
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,769
probably a high chance that you're not

1090
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,970
going to cover all the angles so focus

1091
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:12,368
on the things that are gonna be of

1092
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,589
highest impact and then it doesn't mean

1093
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:16,239
that you basically ignore the other

1094
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:18,999
things that are gonna be less less

1095
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,970
impactful but it allows for you to focus

1096
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:24,038
it allows for you to focus your

1097
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:26,288
activities and voll management and

1098
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:29,049
architecture and exploitation and

1099
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:32,489
vulnerability research to things that

1100
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:32,489
support a threat objective

1101
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:37,819
the the last thing I'll mention here is

1102
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:40,670
beyond just simply recommending you know

1103
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:41,990
risk-based approach is you know look

1104
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,299
into other different frameworks like I

1105
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:46,189
really like the Stix framework a lot I

1106
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:48,140
know it hasn't been you know there's

1107
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,730
about 50 or so companies that are having

1108
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,859
a taxi servers and they're really using

1109
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:53,240
sticks a lot one of the things that

1110
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:55,490
we're doing is that we're actually

1111
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,618
trying to be the leader in one of the

1112
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,848
domains Stix has twelve domains and one

1113
00:44:57,619 --> 00:45:01,970
of the domains that doesn't get a lot of

1114
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:04,549
Showtime is a campaign domain now

1115
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:06,529
there's there's apt campaigns that you

1116
00:45:04,549 --> 00:45:07,970
know mandiant puts out but some of the

1117
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,270
things that I mentioned from the global

1118
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,709
economic forum that as it relates to

1119
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:14,930
like what what is to say that in five

1120
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,299
ten years we're not gonna have a power

1121
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:21,618
play on water right as a natural

1122
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:24,349
resource what about you know climate or

1123
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:25,760
environmental hacking for the purposes

1124
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:27,790
of creating you know environmental

1125
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,440
threats against an adversarial you know

1126
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,549
country you know because those sort of

1127
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,710
things you know as we're seeing in

1128
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:35,509
California cost a lot of time and money

1129
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,270
and livelihood and and a lot of

1130
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:41,089
different things that really consumes a

1131
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:44,000
lot of resources for local and domestic

1132
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:45,380
resources within the country so things

1133
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,349
are going to get pretty advanced really

1134
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:52,299
quick and so in order to get information

1135
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:54,980
quickly sticks provides a really good

1136
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:57,049
schema and set of criteria it's well

1137
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,579
thought out it's interlinking domains

1138
00:45:57,049 --> 00:46:00,710
where you can look at indicators

1139
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:02,180
compromise and how that is associated

1140
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:05,119
with vulnerabilities and how that's

1141
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:07,819
associated with different campaigns it

1142
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,160
needs evolution but it's something that

1143
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:13,160
we're actively using and working with

1144
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,690
other players that are have already had

1145
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:19,190
stand sheet of their own taxi services

1146
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:20,990
you can there's this service called hail

1147
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,809
a taxi if you haven't heard of it how

1148
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:25,848
many I've heard of hail a taxi you know

1149
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:29,049
there's you know it's basically kind of

1150
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:31,880
a three free thread exchange place

1151
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:34,549
obviously you leave places like FSI sack

1152
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,099
there they are reported to have abide by

1153
00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:39,200
the latest sticks protocol

1154
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:42,049
the unfortunate thing with sticks is

1155
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,000
that it used to be supported and really

1156
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,280
managed by mitre a lot but then I got

1157
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,110
forked over 200

1158
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,450
but there's still a global community and

1159
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:52,160
pushed leveraging that and I've talked

1160
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:55,509
to people like Richard shrews who's kind

1161
