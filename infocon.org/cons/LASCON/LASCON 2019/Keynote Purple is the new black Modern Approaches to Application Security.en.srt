I'm already making it's good okay hi I'm

11
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:13,680
Tanya how's it going welcome to last con

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,390
yes I've never been to Austin before and

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,420
so far it's been really delicious and

14
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,250
welcoming so today we're gonna talk

15
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,530
about purple is the new black

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,899
the modern approaches to application

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,540
security all right okay so today we're

18
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:29,729
going to talk about red team which is

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,440
offensive security right and then we're

20
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,050
gonna talk about blue team which is

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,130
defensive security we're going to talk

22
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:42,390
about purple team which is collaborative

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:46,289
security and we're gonna talk a bit

24
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,300
about this how many how many see

25
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:50,459
security people like this like we're

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,399
badasses and we're criminals we're

27
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,590
dangerous that's not what I see when I

28
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,110
look around this room and when I look

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,700
around all the people I've worked with I

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,259
see something a bit more like this I

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,330
personally feel that like what we do is

32
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,959
a noble profession we're protecting

33
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,609
people

34
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,259
we're helping developers make more

35
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,020
secure software that's what applications

36
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:16,708
carry people do who here's a developer

37
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,170
or writes code yeah okay who here does

38
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,680
security yeah see we should all be

39
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,530
friends

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,590
perfect so that's like the gist of the

41
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,540
talk so this is the mandatory about me

42
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,420
slide where I try to prove that I am

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,329
qualified to get my own talk so I like

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,780
punk rock and I

45
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:38,870
Tania Jacob this is also me I clean up

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,370
nicely and I'm on the internet and I

47
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,020
called she hacks purple because I'm a

48
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,930
purple Timur which you will learn all

49
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:48,260
about today I started my own company and

50
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,460
we're called security sidekick and I get

51
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,730
the best title ever

52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,590
I am totally obsessed with Allah so I

53
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,269
talk about husband all my talks even

54
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,520
when it doesn't necessarily make sense

55
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,340
because I that's my community and those

56
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,530
are my people I started a thing called

57
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,650
lowsec so if you're a woman we have a

58
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,450
chapter Bozek here in Austin and it's a

59
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,320
like women of security and we just hang

60
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,179
out and make friends and I'm hired the

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,010
Deaf slop team sloppy DevOps

62
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,060
that's us okay so hopefully you're like

63
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,530
geez alright so these are the four

64
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,630
things we're gonna cover in the talk I

65
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,300
really like to be super organized when I

66
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,859
give a talk oh good so focus so fuzz is

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,570
really upset with me because I won't run

68
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,760
until Metasploit we're going to talk

69
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,560
about collaboration empathy and advocacy

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,260
which I know you're like I thought this

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,580
was a Tech Talk it's gonna be okay then

72
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,070
we're going to talk about security

73
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,959
tactics for modern applications so I'm

74
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,410
not gonna talk about like oh how to make

75
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,300
sure SQL injection doesn't happen I feel

76
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,130
we should know that I'm just gonna talk

77
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,250
about the new weirder cooler stuff

78
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,140
because everyone else already talks in

79
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,380
depth about that we're gonna talk about

80
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,899
automating boring stuff I write code so

81
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,250
I don't have to do things twice and

82
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,959
we're gonna talk about continuous

83
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,739
learning which is why you are all here

84
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,950
today

85
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:11,060
alright let's do this let's get purple

86
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:16,630
okay so this is a Venn diagram of Venn

87
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:19,579
diagrams yeah I know I'm a nerd but um

88
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,230
so I know you're all at last con so most

89
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,969
of you already know a lot of the things

90
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,740
I'm gonna say in this very two-minute

91
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,540
very short two-minute segment of

92
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,340
definitions but I want to make sure that

93
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,470
everyone is with us for the whole talk

94
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,000
sometimes super advanced talks they like

95
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,710
skip ahead to things I want to make sure

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,780
you're all with me so just if you

97
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,688
already know this just take pictures and

98
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:43,448
tweet out the hashtag what's

99
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:46,899
take again last con ASX ATX okay what is

100
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:49,929
AB sec it's any and everything you do to

101
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:51,429
make your software more secure so if you

102
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:53,109
are prepping through your source code

103
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:55,659
and removing an old function that you

104
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,969
now know is insecure if you had a pen

105
00:04:55,659 --> 00:05:00,819
test and then you fix these things if

106
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:02,409
you are just coming here and learning

107
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:04,389
about how to make more all of those

108
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:08,169
things are AB set things they're all

109
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:09,549
related to application security I said

110
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:12,758
that next

111
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:14,558
what's that SEC ops so according to me

112
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,069
and since I'm on stage and I have the

113
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:19,779
mic that's what you get to hear I

114
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:21,849
believe that it is what apps tech

115
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,979
professionals do when we work in DevOps

116
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:25,929
environments so I know DevOps is

117
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:27,849
supposed to embody security and I

118
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:29,529
promise I will stop saying devstack ops

119
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:31,628
as soon as they all promise to only

120
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:34,808
release secure software so until then

121
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,459
we're at an impasse um so my friend

122
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:37,959
Imran taught me this he's like it's just

123
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,759
you doing app SEC but you have to adjust

124
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,479
and you have to change so that you fit

125
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:47,189
in to DevOps awesome so what is a red

126
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:51,610
team so it's attackers it's offense

127
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:53,919
right so it's adversarial style security

128
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,909
testing it's often against production

129
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,438
which is scary it helps us find helps us

130
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,599
find real risks so it's not paper

131
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,159
exercise like threat modeling where you

132
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,589
come up with all the things it's like

133
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:07,659
what can we actually find wrong now it's

134
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:10,300
not cheap and you have to be careful but

135
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:13,748
it's pretty amazing ok so what is blue

136
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,019
team blue team are our defenders they

137
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:18,099
protect us they insure our defenses are

138
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:21,069
effective they make sure we have

139
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,719
defenses they are the people that do the

140
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:24,789
monitoring the logging the patching the

141
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:29,079
bug they're they do all the things that

142
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:32,789
make life good and smooth ok so then

143
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:35,050
what it what's purple team right so

144
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:38,139
according to me it's collaboration

145
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,110
empathy and advocacy as part of it so

146
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:44,319
what is purple team some people tell me

147
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,479
it's blue team plus red team but both of

148
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,610
them do network security they do all

149
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,180
sorts of other things right like it's

150
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,520
not

151
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,350
and encompassing of both of those I

152
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,789
believe Purple's in the middle and what

153
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:59,070
our job is to do is to collaborate

154
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,930
communicate and contribute cooperate

155
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,580
that bridge in between the developers

156
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,080
and the security team that makes them

157
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,419
get along and work well together

158
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:12,430
instead of having coffee as separate

159
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:16,320
coffee houses they do teaching they

160
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:19,030
provide tools they help with learning um

161
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,030
often known as the bridge in between the

162
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:25,809
two teams I'm gonna throw this clicker

163
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:29,320
out after purple team is AB SEC as a

164
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,180
whole and it overlaps the red team and

165
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,830
the blue team so it's not everything the

166
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,360
red team does is just some of the things

167
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,800
the red team does and it's some of the

168
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,810
things the blue team does it's why they

169
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,990
have different names they hold

170
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,850
consultations with developers they give

171
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,840
guidance they give assistance they give

172
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:48,699
enablement they give developers tools

173
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,969
and teach them how to use them

174
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:55,539
they don't yell at developers mm-hmm

175
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,280
they create tools if they have to they

176
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,830
create documentation that people can

177
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,840
read and understand so they don't say oh

178
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,250
your key should be ephemeral because

179
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,679
that's vague and doesn't mean anything

180
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,229
and a developer can't code that they say

181
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,169
I want our session IDs to be destroyed

182
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:14,320
every hour and replaced after 15 minutes

183
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,789
of an you know inactivity this that it's

184
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,639
like very specific things that

185
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,860
developers can then go and code it and

186
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,930
they advocate for security and for

187
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,180
developers you know I just say that

188
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,860
again

189
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,020
so they advocate for both the developers

190
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,400
and the security I don't know if any of

191
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,620
you have ever worked with someone where

192
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,838
all they can see is what they need at

193
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,820
work and build burn down the rest of the

194
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,469
building to get like their part done I

195
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,849
have worked at places where they're like

196
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,380
we're gonna put in the security thing

197
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,419
even though it's gonna break everything

198
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,950
and everyone hates us and you know we're

199
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,490
gonna get this much wind but we're gonna

200
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,890
break everything else that is not purple

201
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,440
team that doesn't work in the long run

202
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,750
so it is my opinion that purple team is

203
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,380
a modern approach to applications Kari

204
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:01,810
okay so what do I mean by advocacy has a

205
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,499
lot of people are like what does that

206
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,218
mean so my

207
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:10,569
last job I was an advocate and

208
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:11,289
advocating for security means well let's

209
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:13,959
look at a slide

210
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:18,009
okay so principles for success I'm not

211
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:21,029
sure why that's so dark sorry about

212
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:25,209
that's super bright on my screen okay so

213
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:26,859
advocates fight for the things that help

214
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,899
the people that they're advocating for

215
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:31,029
so they're fighting for a cause they're

216
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,159
fighting for a policy whatever the thing

217
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,869
is I used to work somewhere and we had

218
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:37,089
the stupidest password policy ever it

219
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:40,419
had to be super super complex and eight

220
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:42,909
characters long we're trying to talk

221
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:44,379
them and do like 18 or 16 or 20

222
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,449
characters but it didn't need to be

223
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:49,509
complex and they're like what if we went

224
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:53,319
to six characters and it wasn't complex

225
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:55,509
no the executives they're like no

226
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:57,069
passwords like do you mean password

227
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:59,259
lists like single sign and they're just

228
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:02,579
like no like just do away with that and

229
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:03,759
so the didn't go out but the point is

230
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:05,138
okay

231
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,229
so you need a few things to make sure

232
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:12,009
you advocate advocate successfully and

233
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:15,039
one is independence so when do we want

234
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,899
it we want it on demand I don't want to

235
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,549
wait for a ticket I don't want it right

236
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,139
now so whatever you can do to make sure

237
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:22,149
people can get the things they need from

238
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:24,449
the security team when they need it as

239
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:27,099
opposed to when you're available yes

240
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,389
confidentiality so if someone comes to

241
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:29,949
me and tells me like I've made this

242
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:31,239
mistake they need to know I'm not gonna

243
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:34,569
shame them in the next team meeting

244
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:39,419
right they need to know I I will keep

245
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:41,679
their confidence human-centered approach

246
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,569
remember there's people at the other end

247
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,589
of the job that you're doing sometimes I

248
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:49,509
have forgotten that empowerment so I

249
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:50,949
consider this giving them tools giving

250
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,989
them processes that actually work

251
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,868
they're actually efficient that are not

252
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:57,249
helped and then giving them the

253
00:10:55,869 --> 00:11:00,449
knowledge so they can actually do things

254
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:03,909
themselves make their own decisions

255
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,988
equal opportunity I don't know if any of

256
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:06,369
you have ever worked somewhere where

257
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:08,469
they're like only the senior texts need

258
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:10,940
to learn security the junior techs are

259
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:12,680
stupid like Oh

260
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,740
oh I would hate to work for someone like

261
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,109
you that would call me that I think that

262
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,790
security is for everyone not just the

263
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,430
senior people like maybe there's layers

264
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,740
to how much you teach each level but

265
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,939
we're not advocating for developers if

266
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,330
we're only teaching some of them and

267
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,740
excluding others equal opportunity well

268
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,930
I guess I already made that point oh

269
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,790
yeah no accountability on both sides so

270
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,660
if I make a mistake I want people to be

271
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,890
able to tell me I made a mistake nicely

272
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,589
so that I can correct it and fix it

273
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,240
later if you have a good relationship

274
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,830
between the security team and the

275
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,750
developers you can actually discuss

276
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,400
things like ok so we did this like have

277
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,910
that happen let's look into it you can

278
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,980
do a blameless style post-mortem a way

279
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,959
to look at things where it's not Alice's

280
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,730
fall or Bob's fall it's like oh that

281
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,740
process was missing or that safeguard

282
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,590
was broken and that stopped this from

283
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,750
happening or it broke that lastly we

284
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,600
want accessibility so we want to make

285
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,320
security possible for all sometimes that

286
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,110
means you have to make special

287
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,860
situations for different teams I don't

288
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,420
mean accessibility as in putting like

289
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,100
definitely a building as accessible

290
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,160
that's what most of us think it is but I

291
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,950
mean making tech accessible - ok next

292
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,770
empathy it turns out that soft skills

293
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,380
are actually life skills but just some

294
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:32,360
people don't have them you can't

295
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,180
actually get very far in tech if you

296
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,070
have no personal skills if like you

297
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,959
can't talk to people and not have them

298
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,090
hate you later or if you can't

299
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,800
communicate something clearly to someone

300
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,930
like you're never going to be a senior

301
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,719
tech right you're not gonna go very far

302
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,670
in your career and empathy is you

303
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,650
actually thinking about something from

304
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,810
someone else's point of view so if I am

305
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,449
the security person and I need to who

306
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,010
care to have the Phoenix project yeah ok

307
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,750
I see a lot of hands there's like this

308
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,730
part of the project where they want to

309
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,070
put in the security token ization thing

310
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,540
and the security teams like well we just

311
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,040
need it and then it broke everything

312
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,510
under the Sun and they just kept pushing

313
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,849
and pushing and they just didn't care

314
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,040
because they couldn't empathize with all

315
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:18,110
the other teams that maybe this wasn't

316
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,240
the best win for everyone ok so now I

317
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,900
talked about idols and how we're totally

318
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,900
obsessed with hackers

319
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:29,779
so I believe that our community is

320
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,849
obsessed with hackers and so is the

321
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:35,149
media I believe that people are like

322
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:36,739
really really interested a lot more

323
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:44,779
interested in hackers than I am

324
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:49,009
personally they're not they're not as

325
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:52,489
many movies about accountants in it and

326
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:56,089
that's because we're obsessed with only

327
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:58,549
red teamers and pen testers I run this

328
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,959
thing oh wait no let's go back I run

329
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:01,279
this thing called mentoring Monday every

330
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,439
Monday on the internet where I try to

331
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,269
match people with mentors and mentees

332
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:08,118
together so they can learn more so we

333
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,949
can get more people into InfoSec the

334
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:11,629
number one thing the number two thing

335
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,639
number three number four thing is web

336
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:15,979
app pentesting everyone wants to be a

337
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,109
pen tester with it it's because they

338
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:19,339
don't know that our job exists they

339
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:21,409
don't know that there's incident

340
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,729
responders and that work is so important

341
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:26,239
there's people that do forensics there's

342
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:29,149
so many cool jobs there in InfoSec they

343
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:30,979
are totally badass too but we have all

344
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,829
day silly movies like we saw in the last

345
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:36,229
slide can I go back yeah it's like movie

346
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,849
after movie after movie because we're

347
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:39,439
totally obsessed and I don't think that

348
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,169
that's helping our industry another

349
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:44,269
thing that I see because I used to be a

350
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:46,789
web at pentester is like like you get

351
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:48,470
called in at the end no one's looked at

352
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:51,139
security you come in you're at cave -

353
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,909
you look awesome as a pen tester because

354
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,470
no one has done security before you got

355
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:56,269
there I don't want to look awesome I

356
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,639
want you to make it secure perhaps and

357
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,559
so I see a lot of places to spending

358
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,419
their entire security budget only on pen

359
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,988
testing like we have exactly enough to

360
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:07,129
test one of our 20 acts I don't know if

361
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,679
that's your best bang for your buck

362
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:12,169
right and again it's I believe it's

363
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,459
because of our idolization of hacking

364
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:17,419
and how that's like the only thing that

365
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:19,909
matters in our industry I believe that

366
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:24,019
we are not attracting as many people as

367
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:25,369
we could because of this and this is the

368
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,379
thing I already told you about mentoring

369
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:32,550
Monday how everyone always asks for that

370
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:36,180
okay so now now that I'm done

371
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,649
hangover like my rant about how we do

372
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,469
not all need to wear hoodies all the

373
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:44,820
time even though I love hoodies and we

374
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,670
are not all like mr. robot the rest is

375
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,170
just going to be modern approaches

376
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,459
application security so these are the

377
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,740
types of things that the purple team's

378
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:55,380
gonna have to do

379
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,149
okay so zero trust if I was in a smaller

380
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,160
room I would make all of you answer what

381
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:02,100
these things are because I'm cruel but

382
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,810
we're not so you're safe however at the

383
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:08,190
end I have candy if you asked a question

384
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:09,750
I stole the idea of Chloe I had candy

385
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,010
and I left it at home so I bought more

386
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,709
last night but there's gonna be a lot of

387
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:17,430
candy today if you play your cards right

388
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:19,680
so zero trust is not trusting anything I

389
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,329
know that that sounds a little bit

390
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,819
ridiculous but what we used to do is we

391
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:26,699
used to have a perimeter we have a giant

392
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,829
firewall and then if someone got in

393
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,140
we're like we just assume you're great

394
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:32,969
you can cut like sugar go look at all my

395
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,579
servers you can come in everywhere

396
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,980
now instead between apps they don't

397
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:40,199
trust there is no reason that like your

398
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,589
app should talk to my apps database no

399
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,990
my database will only talk to my app and

400
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,610
nothing else right all the ports are

401
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,860
closed everything's closed all the time

402
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,050
it's only if you actually need access

403
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,709
that you open it so by default it's

404
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,740
closed it's often coupled with assume

405
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:01,290
breach right so plan things out like if

406
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,329
you were breached where would you not

407
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:07,470
want them to get planned things out as

408
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:09,149
though things have already have you

409
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,410
heard that famous quote there are

410
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,490
companies that have been breached and

411
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,610
there's companies that don't know that

412
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,280
they have been breached right and I like

413
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:18,688
to hope that that's not actually true

414
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,899
but I've worked at enough places that if

415
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:24,540
have breaches that it's not completely

416
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,000
untrue well just show you that bad okay

417
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,970
so server lists and logic apps so a

418
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,919
logic app is a trigger and what it does

419
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,570
is it calls a server less app so it's

420
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,150
just kind of true or false like a thing

421
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,860
happens and the logic app when it's on

422
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,480
it calls a serverless app and a

423
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,219
serverless app it's like a tiny little

424
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,230
script or a tiny little app that runs in

425
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,260
a container it does not run all the time

426
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,120
it only runs when it's trick

427
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,670
so what it does is it explodes a

428
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,350
container it runs its thing and then it

429
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,450
self-destructs and it's gone so you pay

430
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,969
four cents a month instead of having to

431
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,620
post that all the time if you never

432
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,960
really use it right so they're very

433
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,120
efficient but there are different

434
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,620
application security concerns so first

435
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,909
of all like do all the good app sex

436
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,489
stuff you would normally do like

437
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,170
validate your inputs please do all of

438
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,750
those things but on top of that you have

439
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:13,429
to do other things

440
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,260
monitor and log your functions I know

441
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:16,880
they're little but you want to know if

442
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,860
they're being run like fifty thousand

443
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,600
times a month or five times a month you

444
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,570
want to know you want to alert if

445
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,360
someone has tried to call your login API

446
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,399
like fifty five times in a second

447
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,830
because humans can't do that and if you

448
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,110
don't walk or monitor you don't know

449
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,360
that means I as an instant responder

450
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,620
comes in and then I just feel stupid the

451
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,689
whole time because I can't hope because

452
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,540
I have no idea what happened you need to

453
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,530
use secure yet secure coding conventions

454
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,129
you also want to make sure that you

455
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:48,290
secure and verify the data in transit

456
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:51,950
but also I think I have some more here

457
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:56,059
plus yeah okay we want to employ API

458
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,770
gateways so make sure as things travel

459
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,690
that they're like it'll just handle a

460
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,520
lot of the stuff for you and it'll be

461
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,809
like a gate so you can only get in and

462
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,730
call these things if you've been

463
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,320
approved through the Gateway right it's

464
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,970
like a login and then you get all the

465
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,210
fun features it's like that for

466
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,690
computers awesome I already said monitor

467
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,160
and log

468
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,679
oh yeah monitor and log the things but

469
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,809
then put it into the sim so that your

470
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,340
sock can actually see what's going on

471
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,050
I've definitely worked out a bunch of

472
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,559
places when I is a software developer

473
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:27,139
and we loved that stuff into nowhere no

474
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,809
one ever saw it and now that I work in

475
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,220
security I like what were we doing there

476
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,710
we also want to manage secrets in a

477
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,210
secret store so there's like all the

478
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,440
clouds have their own secret swords and

479
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,850
then there's like a bunch of third-party

480
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,460
ones that you can use but if you have a

481
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,439
secret don't handle it in your code get

482
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,880
a company to do it for you and there's a

483
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,770
bunch of open source ones that are free

484
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,340
I'm not going to recommend which one you

485
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,920
get just get one and lastly try to

486
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,870
deploy functions with minimal

487
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,240
granularity so just have a server less

488
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,250
app do one thing don't have it do 25

489
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,350
things then you need 25 serverless apps

490
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,210
and you don't have to run them as often

491
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,510
then if one breaks you still have 24

492
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,770
that are working it's breaking things

493
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,990
down into smaller pieces

494
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:14,429
and do I have one more on this hmm

495
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,140
maintained isolated function parameters

496
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:20,460
I feel like I really should move it a

497
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:23,100
little faster um you need to assume that

498
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,320
the perimeter of your function is just

499
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,389
like an app so if you have an API that

500
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,879
calls another API or a serverless app

501
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,100
that calls another service app it still

502
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,590
needs to reassign Sakata and reauthorize

503
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,000
like it needs to know oh for sure

504
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,428
because you don't want someone else

505
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,490
calling that second API or that second

506
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,290
serverless app directly it needs to be

507
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,480
able to say oh no you're not my person

508
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,740
you're not that API that's not calling

509
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,510
me okay last thing on that

510
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,620
there are party components and library

511
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,330
management they estimate 70% of code and

512
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,209
all new Apps is actually libraries

513
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,250
frameworks they're party components

514
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,919
fancy gap scripts this from a framework

515
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:04,820
that you did not write you accept all of

516
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,169
that risk when you put it into your app

517
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:11,120
so we need to protect against that and

518
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:13,950
so Oh a lot of them call it open source

519
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,260
software scamming it doesn't matter if

520
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,750
it's proprietary or not like dotnet

521
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,460
awesome it's still possible it has owner

522
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,280
abilities right and some of the versions

523
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,840
do it's well documented and so even if

524
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,840
it's not open source you still need to

525
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,189
check it ok so there are a bunch of

526
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,678
companies that make tools that check

527
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,390
this I suggest you use two not one

528
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,700
because they all check in different ways

529
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,020
some of them check the CVE database some

530
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,760
companies are looking at seed

531
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,800
you ease now a bunch of them do their

532
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,560
own research and they all find different

533
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,629
stuff and so if you just have one then

534
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,520
you just get one company's opinion so if

535
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,740
you can afford it if you have time if

536
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,850
you have the ability due to you also

537
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,860
want to you also want to scan your repo

538
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,110
once a week once a day whatever it is

539
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,310
that you feel you can afford and then

540
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,990
the other thing you should do is if you

541
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,780
have a pipeline scan with the different

542
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:06,120
tool in your pipeline so let's say you

543
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,399
only release things once a month if

544
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,899
you're only scanning things in your

545
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,270
pipeline then you wouldn't see it for a

546
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,790
whole month potentially right but if you

547
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,290
scan every five seconds or you release

548
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,659
every five seconds in a pipeline that's

549
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,680
great but maybe the other tool will find

550
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,110
something that it didn't

551
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,190
it's just you'll find more stuff that

552
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:30,360
way and lastly I already said that

553
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:32,010
awesome yes ok next online storage the

554
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,500
crown jewels everyone has heard of

555
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,690
storage buckets that are open that are

556
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,460
not secure I think like Twitter spill

557
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,190
bad out again last night it's like an

558
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,440
old story that we don't like however

559
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,360
there are things we can do so that stops

560
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,330
happening I would like us to have new

561
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,300
things that we make fun of so you can

562
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,409
lock all your buckets down by default no

563
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,690
matter which cloud you're using you can

564
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:57,000
set a template and just no one's allowed

565
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,070
making any sort of storage unless it

566
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,410
follows that template and then for sure

567
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,659
you know that they can't do that by

568
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:08,310
accident right like you've brought the

569
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:11,100
horse to water maybe a better analogy um

570
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,780
you also want to classify your data you

571
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,280
want to classify it as like this is you

572
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,200
know top secret this is secret this is

573
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,690
public etc so that when I as the

574
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,450
incident responder come in I know how

575
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:24,090
bad my day is it really really really

576
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,890
helps I have definitely been called in

577
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,169
and seen oh oh that is publicly

578
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:31,110
accessible data awesome so like everyone

579
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:34,800
can chill out a little bit like it's so

580
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:38,159
bad but it's not as bad again you want

581
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,790
to monitor access file integrity port

582
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,320
sniffing etc with alerts I know

583
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,360
everyone's like it's just storage just

584
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,830
we're just really important all your

585
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,859
important stuff is there

586
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:53,619
okay lastly well not lastly containers

587
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:55,090
and orchestration so container is the

588
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:57,399
smallest part of an operating system

589
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,158
that you need to run whatever your app

590
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:02,799
is that's running on it so while you

591
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,340
know windows might be 2 gigs of hard

592
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,599
drive space and 2 gigs or more of memory

593
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,199
you might have a container that only

594
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:13,269
needs 2 Meg's of data of hard drive

595
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,190
space and then like 4 Meg's a memory

596
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:17,889
it's so so much smaller it's just the

597
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:20,289
core parts that you need right and then

598
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:22,059
orchestration is management of all that

599
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,639
deleting them watching them all of those

600
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:26,080
things it's I imagine like a magical

601
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:29,469
thing in a cartoon where everything just

602
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,149
comes up in music plays like Disney so

603
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:36,070
again follow all the same security

604
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:37,719
Network things that you would plus there

605
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:41,019
are new configurations and you have to

606
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:45,609
learn them sorry there are gonna be new

607
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:47,619
tools to scan these things sorry um

608
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,449
there's new types of vulnerabilities to

609
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,699
watch out for but it's a lot of the same

610
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:57,700
stuff it's just different

611
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:59,379
does that make sense um or one of the

612
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,720
big things is you need to protect who

613
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:03,879
can create or edit containers apparently

614
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,859
this is a fancy new attack thing that

615
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:08,649
you didn't have as much with traditional

616
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:11,168
types of networking but you just

617
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:12,789
basically these are that's kind of the

618
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:16,029
same you need so like patch things or

619
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:17,979
replace them with newer things you need

620
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,720
to scan the things you need to apply

621
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:22,929
zero trust you need to verify that you

622
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,940
have good configurations I know that was

623
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:26,919
anticlimactic slide it's just like you

624
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:35,049
have to do the hard work sorry

625
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:36,609
API is micro services don't enter I have

626
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:39,639
worked so many places where they're like

627
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:43,330
oh those api's oh they're not in scope

628
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:45,129
yes they are yes they are I remember

629
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,989
interviewing to like do a pen test on a

630
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:48,998
mobile app and I'm like can I just

631
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:50,049
assume all the api's are in scope and

632
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:52,139
they looked at me they're like how did

633
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:55,418
you find those and I was like what

634
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:56,490
they're right there so we have to follow

635
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:57,690
all the same stuff

636
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,420
we normally do even if they're small

637
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:04,320
even if they don't run that often okay

638
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:06,090
but Plus service mesh service mash is an

639
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,500
infrastructure layer that basically just

640
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,459
encrypts everything and makes things a

641
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,570
lot nicer it's not sexy but it works

642
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,490
standardization or templating for your

643
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,500
org so if everyone follows the same

644
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:20,030
templates every all the api's talk the

645
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,030
same way a life could be a lot better

646
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:26,309
strict linting of calls to ensure that

647
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,660
it follows the protocol so the DEF

648
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:29,490
thought project one of the things we

649
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,890
released was like an app with horrible

650
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,750
api's and like we could just call

651
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:37,110
whatever functions we wanted but without

652
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,020
the r up there correct HTTP verb so we

653
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,939
would use delete or post in Reverse like

654
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,730
when you shouldn't and then cause havoc

655
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,970
and so if you make sure that everyone is

656
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,559
using the same verbs the should and

657
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:53,250
they're like lint eggs like the grammar

658
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:55,620
police basically okay back throttling

659
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,450
and resource quotas no one no humans

660
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,760
gonna log in a hundred times in a second

661
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:02,460
no humans gonna log in a hundred times

662
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,900
in an hour so if someone is calling your

663
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,500
API a lot slow it down

664
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:10,320
rattle it and resource quotas like don't

665
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,330
allow someone to no one's gonna try to

666
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,330
log into your app hundreds of times per

667
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,678
day it's just not natural when I first

668
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,840
joined make herself one of my colleagues

669
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,790
had this test box that he had put

670
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,649
outside our network way off and Azure

671
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,139
that he'd totally forgotten about and so

672
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:28,470
I found it and someone had been trying

673
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:31,320
to manually brute-force it for months it

674
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,120
was the best for my demos we just let

675
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,750
them keep attacking it because it was so

676
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,500
good like this person had no life they

677
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:44,640
were like the worst hacker ever avenged

678
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:46,679
so they went away it was sad so you want

679
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,420
to authenticate and then authorize if

680
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,890
you don't know who this person is don't

681
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,240
go through the authorization don't waste

682
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,090
your time do that second

683
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,700
and lastly oh there's two more things

684
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:59,370
hide what you can do not share do not

685
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,800
have verbose error messages don't tell

686
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:05,969
them oh that's the wrong verb just be

687
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,740
like error wrong call oh that's waitlist

688
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,370
you're approved

689
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,320
cheapy verbs so like I said like deletes

690
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:15,389
posts gets that's usually all you

691
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,790
actually mean okay

692
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,710
modern tooling so there are a bunch of

693
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,450
new types of tools for app set you do

694
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,980
not have to buy them all you do not have

695
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,050
to learn them all but you should

696
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,700
definitely know they exist so you know

697
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,260
what your options are because things

698
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,410
have really changed in the past couple

699
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:34,559
years okay so I asked interactive

700
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:36,540
application security testing so while

701
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,600
you're using the app this little app

702
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:43,290
inside of it just goes it's my best

703
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,090
that's why I'm in marketing but

704
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,760
basically it happens like in real time

705
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,399
while you're doing your app rasp real

706
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,800
time application security protection the

707
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,840
fanciest laugh you'll ever see no I'm

708
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,250
just kidding but it works like a laugh

709
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,230
it's similar to a wife except for

710
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,450
without you know the big shield and Star

711
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,280
Trek where it comes up and it covers the

712
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,350
whole ship instead it's more at the

713
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,790
application level but basically it's

714
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,379
looking at input and it's like oh that

715
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,360
doesn't look good I don't think so no

716
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,220
thanks

717
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,850
file integrity monitoring which I

718
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,730
believe goes very close with application

719
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,949
whitelisting so this is the thing I'm a

720
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,960
big fan of is application whitelisting

721
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,940
and file integrity somewhat painful

722
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,640
sometimes yes it is does it make sure I

723
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,100
never get malware yes so file integrity

724
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,410
monitoring is like all of your source

725
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,110
files in your operating system it

726
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,550
watches them so they don't change and

727
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,530
waitlisting means only allow these apps

728
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,750
to run so the first thing malware does

729
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:41,399
is it tries to start oh it's not allowed

730
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,690
application whitelisting it's not on the

731
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,750
list great I will change my name to

732
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,130
system dot D or whatever oh wait I'm not

733
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,990
allowed to do that file and then it

734
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,150
can't do anything installing this on

735
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:54,630
your servers is it fun no does it work

736
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:56,130
yes cloud native controls so every

737
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,900
single one of the clouds has now made

738
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:01,920
something new for their own cloud that

739
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,990
only works for them yep and they would

740
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,730
like you to use it

741
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,860
they are customized for your environment

742
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,540
you have to decide if this is good for

743
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,600
you or not proof of concepts are

744
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,100
suggested adding security tools to your

745
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,110
DevOps pipeline so that's all I ever

746
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,240
talk about in my other talks so I'm

747
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,750
gonna skip that haha just kidding I made

748
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,929
don't slide customizable alerts

749
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,850
automated responses so I think there is

750
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:29,870
fancy in the cloud is you can have like

751
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,939
these triggers come up cold logic apps

752
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:35,189
and when it triggers you can actually

753
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,230
rate server less apps that respond I

754
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:40,830
believe they're calling it play books

755
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,780
most of the cloud services but the idea

756
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:45,090
that I could come in in the morning and

757
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,830
receive an email someone was trying to

758
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,870
brute-force this so we blocked their IP

759
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,199
and then it was done and no one had to

760
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:54,330
call me yes that's beautiful

761
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,090
I don't like responding to instance it

762
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,919
sounds like it I don't like it I'm an

763
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,449
application inventory tools so there are

764
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,690
now tools if that will tell you all the

765
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,260
apps that you have it's nice to know

766
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:08,160
okay next

767
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,390
modern tactics so previously that was

768
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,160
tools now we're going to talk about

769
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,520
strategies and tactics and things that

770
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:17,309
you can do adding security tools to your

771
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,050
DevOps pipeline I know I've already said

772
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:21,928
that but it's kind of a tool and it's

773
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:25,290
kind of a tactic and so who here uses

774
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:27,450
pipelines at work it's becoming slightly

775
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,889
more popular I think over time we will

776
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,980
continue to automate things because

777
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:34,710
doing things manually is boring negative

778
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,450
unit testing so who here has used unit

779
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,490
tests before where it tests the smallest

780
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,140
amount of code possible so you can take

781
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,600
those and you can add payloads to them

782
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,630
and by that I mean like negative abusive

783
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,949
code you can make sure that it fails

784
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:48,450
gracefully and you can have your

785
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,220
developers run those when they run the

786
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,350
rest of the test that takes time it's

787
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,720
not cheap but it works really really

788
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,459
well you can have progressive security

789
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,170
testing every time your developer runs

790
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,470
those tests and they have to run the

791
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:03,720
tests before they check in breaking

792
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:06,840
security into smaller pieces and having

793
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,800
security sprints I talk about this a lot

794
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,500
too but basically you can't have how to

795
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,110
explain you can't do a three-week code

796
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,120
freeze while I do code review anymore no

797
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,639
one's going to wait for that so we have

798
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,379
to adjust so that strategy is about

799
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,950
adjusting and sprinting if developers

800
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,280
are sprinting too

801
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:29,200
and turning pen tests into unit tests so

802
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,060
whenever I would pay someone else to

803
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,980
come do a pen test I would take that

804
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:35,230
like a shopping list because those

805
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,670
developers made my other apps and they

806
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,470
probably made the same mistake so I

807
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,300
would go look for the same things and if

808
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,090
you have unit tests some of the things

809
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:46,750
from your pen test might make fantastic

810
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:48,820
malicious unit tests tuning tools for

811
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,170
automation and efficiency do not just

812
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,700
plunk in a security tool and walk away

813
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,280
make sure it doesn't break everything

814
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,990
make sure that there's not any false

815
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,510
positives I've worked out a lot of

816
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,070
places where that is most of the work in

817
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,590
security tools is tuning out the false

818
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:06,460
positives it's not fun it's worth the

819
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:08,709
effort automated repository scanning for

820
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,450
vulnerabilities for your third-party

821
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,300
components if you can get it to do code

822
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,250
review for you that would be magical

823
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:18,610
etcetera etc etc so I talked about this

824
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:22,030
a lot and we only have 17 minutes left

825
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:25,179
so next dev sec ops this is my favorite

826
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:28,870
talk this is my favorite topic so much

827
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:31,150
so that it has a heart I'm a big fan if

828
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:35,260
you're gonna do DevOps where do we fit

829
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:37,360
in right so to remind you my definition

830
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,520
is that its application security

831
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,850
activities in a DevOps environments what

832
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:45,550
I do it's what all of you do adding

833
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:48,010
security to the pipeline's ensuring

834
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:50,020
faster security feedback every single

835
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,879
way that you can do it whether that be

836
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,740
in a pipeline whether that be creating

837
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,900
your own libraries whether that be

838
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,940
sending out reminders whatever the thing

839
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,620
is that you do to make sure developers

840
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,730
find out as soon as possible that

841
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,520
they've done something wrong so it's

842
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:09,760
cheaper faster and easier to fix every

843
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:13,270
moment in DevOps is a teaching moment if

844
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,610
it's good or if it's bad I make mistakes

845
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:18,730
I don't know about you but I am only a

846
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:22,330
mere mortal I have made errors probably

847
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,590
today and that's okay but the key is is

848
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,650
that we learn from them and we do better

849
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:29,080
the next time and if you take every

850
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:31,450
single thing as a learning moment and

851
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,400
like hold a lunch and learn or teach

852
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:35,350
people the first time I was somewhere

853
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,090
and they did that I hated it we had an

854
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:39,549
incident and it was awful so

855
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,100
bad bad things happened are so

856
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,300
embarrassing and my manager insisted on

857
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,489
holding a Lunch and Learn with the

858
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:49,570
developers and telling them about it all

859
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:51,819
of the badness I I'm a perfectionist I

860
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,920
found that really hard all those

861
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,050
developers from then on wanted security

862
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,670
training all those developers from then

863
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,220
on were like we're never making that

864
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,720
mistake ever again they fixed all of the

865
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,819
things I asked them to all of a sudden I

866
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,520
had this army behind me of people that

867
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,810
had bought in and I was like you know

868
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,970
they're gonna think we're idiots and my

869
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:14,049
manager is like just trust me trust me

870
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:15,910
and he is right weaving security into

871
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,640
the process for speed ease and

872
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,319
efficiency wherever you can you're

873
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,210
allowed to be as creative as you want to

874
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,580
whether you're in a DevOps environment

875
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,110
or not like it's your goal to make sure

876
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,330
they create secure apps it doesn't

877
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,400
matter if you do it with bribery like

878
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,259
bringing in cookies or doughnuts doesn't

879
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:38,050
matter I still respect your efforts

880
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,880
okay so oh yeah and at the end is like a

881
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,650
talk that I have that's about that if

882
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,480
you want it I usually put links at the

883
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,820
bottom of the screen but these slides

884
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,770
will be available right yeah okay I'm

885
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,850
seeing organizers not perfect so if you

886
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,600
don't get it now you could get it later

887
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,960
okay

888
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,520
cloud security Tonya you can't just talk

889
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,360
about cloud security whenever you want

890
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,610
so I know it was supposed to be an app

891
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,490
Tech Talk but some apps live on the

892
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:06,010
cloud right so if you write a really

893
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:08,950
super secure app but all of your clouds

894
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:11,470
like wide open it still it doesn't look

895
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,540
good for you so the cloud presents a new

896
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,459
and different set of risks we need to

897
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,710
adjust accordingly I suggest you just

898
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,450
learn the basics of it like you don't

899
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,950
need to become a cloud security expert

900
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,689
but if you are doing stuff and your

901
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,549
company is in the cloud learning the

902
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,230
basics will set you apart from your

903
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:30,520
peers but also make sure you have good

904
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:32,350
outcomes so oh yeah this isn't a 45 I'm

905
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,670
not allowed yeah so if you want to know

906
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,100
more I have lots more stuff on that

907
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:40,030
topic just learning the basics I think

908
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,799
is not that painful and it will really

909
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,870
help you understand your architecture

910
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,700
and everything for your apps I used to

911
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,230
only do software and then ice

912
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,700
learning security and networking and has

913
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:52,270
given me this whole new view on

914
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,770
everything I built okay summary so if

915
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,509
you wanted to take a picture of a slide

916
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,730
oh wait wait

917
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,770
no go back go back this would be the

918
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,910
slide so it's just these are the topics

919
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,040
that we just covered in this section

920
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:07,569
we're going on to the third and fourth

921
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,580
sections which are really short okay

922
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:11,110
just waiting until because you know like

923
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,040
people take out their phone and then I

924
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:16,690
don't want be that person that's like

925
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:17,230
haha too late okay everyone's got it

926
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,330
good

927
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,190
okay so automate some boring stuff and

928
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:24,700
as a kitten within automate the boring

929
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:27,250
staff book awesome okay so I want to

930
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,810
avoid manual errors I want my job to be

931
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:34,390
challenging and interesting not boring

932
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:37,990
on a board avoid oil so I want to make

933
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:39,810
everything faster so I automate so toil

934
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:44,439
so my friend Steve Murawski made this

935
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:46,720
this for me toil is so I had never heard

936
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,470
the term toil but as soon as I saw this

937
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:54,520
slide I was like yes junior developer I

938
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:57,060
mean no this is the kind of work that

939
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:01,150
tends to be manual repetitive

940
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:05,230
automatable tactical devoid of enduring

941
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:07,900
value scales literally as service grows

942
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:10,090
so let's say I remember staying late one

943
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,890
night and me and all my staff we all had

944
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:17,170
to upgrade to like Windows 7 and we we

945
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:20,410
had to stay late and we had to manually

946
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,480
do each machine so that meant that Tanya

947
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,180
could do seven chef pierre could do

948
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:29,380
seven shell map from Quebec you know

949
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:32,049
everyone's just something it's true and

950
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,850
so a bit like we all had to just like a

951
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,320
run around the whole night like manually

952
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,790
doing it instead of like using an

953
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,070
automated tool that would do it for us

954
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:42,730
right so that's toil no who wants to do

955
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:45,100
that so automation our best friend so

956
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:47,080
dev sac ops a pipeline is automation

957
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,480
that's what it is

958
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,520
you can also create a parallel security

959
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,050
pipeline so it's asynchronous from the

960
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,509
developer pipeline it doesn't go to prod

961
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,520
it is just something developers can kick

962
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,530
off and it does

963
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,290
long tests like you know you do static

964
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:03,870
code analysis and it just goes on and on

965
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,790
and on and on that is in the

966
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,140
asynchronous pipeline that can run all

967
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,060
weekend because it's not going anywhere

968
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,069
and no one's waiting on it and then you

969
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:14,970
can come in Monday and have fun going

970
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:18,750
through all the results right but we can

971
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:21,569
automate like boring tests to SEC ops is

972
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:23,310
awesome so infrastructure is code is

973
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,890
starting to be used more and more where

974
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:27,450
you code out the things you want and

975
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,950
then you run it and then it builds all

976
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,810
the infrastructure for you in the cloud

977
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:34,020
which is really cool I have another talk

978
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:36,240
about that and then the idea of sec ops

979
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,560
is that you code in the security into

980
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,299
your infrastructure in your

981
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,860
infrastructures code so it's security is

982
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,280
code it's awesome

983
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,780
oh that's what that's like this yeah so

984
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,270
then another thing is Deb sex so that's

985
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:51,510
the app sex side of DevOps that's the

986
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:54,000
application developer side all the

987
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,620
things I previously mentioned but the

988
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,690
results of this are were proactive

989
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:02,670
instead of reactive right so we can do

990
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,700
work to prevent incidents instead of

991
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,680
always just managing incidents we can

992
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,230
tress that you know we're not going to

993
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,299
be tired and make an error we can work

994
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,210
to upgrade security because again we're

995
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,040
not just putting out fires all the time

996
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,630
less time cleaning up messes meaning

997
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,170
more time getting things done that you

998
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:24,600
actually wanted to get done so I like to

999
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:28,410
think of it dev sex with dev psych ops

1000
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:30,420
less toil we're trying out yes okay

1001
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:34,290
continuous learning this is the fourth

1002
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:37,040
part every moments a teaching moment

1003
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:40,980
even if it's embarrassing

1004
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,660
continuous learning so I think oh I'm so

1005
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,250
sorry the slides so dark it's super

1006
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,370
bright on here I don't know what's going

1007
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:49,740
on okay so the moment we stop learning

1008
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,759
we are in trouble tech changes

1009
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,089
constantly

1010
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,500
I took almost a year off to learn French

1011
00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:00,030
and when I came back things had changed

1012
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,220
you have to keep learning all the time

1013
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:04,910
you're gonna be in trouble so every

1014
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:07,850
moment is a teaching moment good

1015
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,920
bad embarrassing or not if you work in a

1016
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:11,750
place where there's psychological safety

1017
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,790
like where you're able to express

1018
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,020
yourself and admit faults like this is a

1019
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,720
place where you're gonna get all the

1020
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,340
things done like when I work with people

1021
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,049
I want them to know that they can tell

1022
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,150
me like I screwed up this bulb I'm like

1023
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,320
no problem let's go fix it let's make

1024
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,110
sure it never happens again

1025
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,610
if you yell at people which I'm not

1026
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,390
saying I'm perfect I've definitely lost

1027
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,550
my crap

1028
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,080
before when things have happened right

1029
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,930
but if you yell at people no one's gonna

1030
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,460
trust you so you can do this with micro

1031
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,470
lessons lunch and learns computer-based

1032
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,910
training coming to hear the training

1033
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,709
that was before the conference started

1034
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:45,109
there's a chameleon options for learning

1035
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,180
and some of them are free but they all

1036
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:50,630
require time and effort and that's the

1037
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:53,960
part you have to pay developers and opt

1038
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:56,170
oakes constantly bring in new tech so we

1039
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,970
have to learn about it because otherwise

1040
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:02,210
they will release it and not tell us and

1041
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:04,370
just go around us because they do they

1042
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,290
do that right who here thinks no one

1043
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:10,930
ever releases anything without telling

1044
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:14,000
the security team okay good good

1045
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:16,940
everyone here same awesome so learning

1046
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,010
calendar blocks for learning if you set

1047
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,510
like a weekly reminder every Thursday

1048
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,250
from like two till three like that's

1049
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,230
your time you might not do it every week

1050
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,730
but eventually you might make your way

1051
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:28,460
through a whole bunch of certifications

1052
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,620
I ended up taking a bunch of university

1053
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,690
courses doing it that way

1054
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:34,310
job shadowing mentoring on-the-job

1055
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,890
learning I'm a huge proponent for

1056
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:38,870
learning from others sharing info with

1057
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,080
other teams so if you make a mistake or

1058
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:44,779
if you win I'm a huge fan of celebrating

1059
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,970
wins on my slack channel at work at the

1060
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,310
past bunch of places I've worked I make

1061
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:51,049
a winning channel and then we just bring

1062
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:54,110
to each other like yes I smashed that

1063
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:57,190
book awesome and it hopes encourage you

1064
00:42:54,110 --> 00:43:00,650
and your the rest of your team

1065
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:03,350
Wow this clicker metrics baek's training

1066
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:06,290
design lessons and issues that you've

1067
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:08,650
had so everywhere I've ever worked I'll

1068
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:11,029
go and I'll look at all of the basic

1069
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,930
like all the scan results that they've

1070
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,339
had find that

1071
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,669
three and then I make lunch and learns

1072
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:18,140
on them you can do this too I'll I'll

1073
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,630
just tell you the answer right now two

1074
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,629
of the top three are always cross-site

1075
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:25,190
scripting and lack of security headers

1076
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,789
you could just start with those now so

1077
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:31,339
you could just go on Monday and do that

1078
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:33,890
build your own training specific for

1079
00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:34,369
your org if you can afford it this is

1080
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,710
awesome

1081
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:39,020
at Microsoft they have this training and

1082
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,640
it's amazing and it's called strike and

1083
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,309
I told them they should sell it and they

1084
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,440
won't but it's so good they have like

1085
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:48,710
in-depth OPSEC training for every single

1086
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,660
developer all paid for um oh so story

1087
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,750
time the time that I invented DevOps

1088
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,549
this story's not true so I I spoke at

1089
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,170
RSA and I gave a talk about dev sec ops

1090
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:59,089
and this person so one of my friends

1091
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,430
she's like yeah someone came back from

1092
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:03,288
our saying like Tonya invented this cool

1093
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,230
thing it's called DevOps

1094
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:08,630
mysticum floods I did not say that and

1095
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:11,299
she said yeah my colleague has not been

1096
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:13,789
in training for so long they didn't know

1097
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:17,000
DevOps existed had never heard of it and

1098
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:21,920
thought you invented it and I was like

1099
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,980
not even my mom thinks I'm not cool so

1100
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,720
conclusion so this is gonna be like a

1101
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,750
really small rant five promises short

1102
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,640
okay so I am tired of everyone thinking

1103
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,760
if this guy when they think of our

1104
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,710
industry that is not what a hacker looks

1105
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,200
like this is what a hacker looks like

1106
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,299
this is what a hacker looks like look

1107
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,419
all around this room that's what a

1108
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:46,759
hacker looks like look in the mirror and

1109
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,349
remember that is what an information

1110
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:52,130
security professional looks like and

1111
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:54,049
when we stop projecting over and over

1112
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,839
and over this hoodie thing and a dark

1113
00:44:54,049 --> 00:45:00,559
basement having social issues being

1114
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:02,058
depressed angry at the world when we

1115
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,650
stop projecting that I think will get a

1116
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:04,309
lot more people joining our industry I'm

1117
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:07,369
not kidding

1118
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:10,430
and also please be nice to developers

1119
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:12,200
they are our friends sometimes we forget

1120
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,970
and we get frustrated please be nice to

1121
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,009
them because we cannot do it without

1122
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:21,319
them okay so that is that's the end of

1123
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,820
my rant and now I'm gonna give you a

1124
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:25,220
