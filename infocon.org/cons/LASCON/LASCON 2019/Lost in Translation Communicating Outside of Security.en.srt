2
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,260
all right everyone thank you for joining

3
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,879
me today I know that there is a talk we

4
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,879
have in another room that has sexy in

5
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,790
the title so I'm glad y'all Jose join me

6
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,589
today so this talk is lost in

7
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,519
translation I've also been calling it

8
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:51,140
can you hear me

9
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:54,199
and it's about communicating security

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,600
outside of your security teams the

11
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,720
alternate title to this talk that is

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,870
less HR approved is you have to talk to

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,750
people get over it let that sit with you

14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,490
for a second

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,650
also my twitter is on the bottom of

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,240
every slide if y'all want to like harass

17
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,979
me and send me cat pictures I highly

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
recommend it

19
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:16,939
so a little bit of audience

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,039
participation time I'm gonna ask you to

21
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,548
raise your hands for me it's early we

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,159
can all do that so I want to know how

23
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,659
many like security people are in the

24
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,509
room like you identify as like InfoSec

25
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:32,689
only cool mostly

26
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:37,159
okay how about managers all right I see

27
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:38,539
you guys how about developers yes okay

28
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,680
cool so it's there's some overlap there

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,760
cool all right

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,870
so I try to do that so I get a little

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,180
bit of a read of the room because this

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,799
talk is about developers for security

33
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,490
people so developers I'm speaking for

34
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,460
all of you today

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,190
you're welcome it's a little bit about

36
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,960
me cuz you shared I'm gonna share I'm a

37
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,580
security engineer at Rome Italy it's a

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,039
start-up out in Seattle but I live in

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,190
Minneapolis I have no street cred in

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,530
Austin but hopefully y'all welcome you

41
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,179
know southern hospitality anyway my

42
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,669
previous background kind of comes from

43
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,890
product security engineering and kind of

44
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:16,700
a DevOps II background I was a build guy

45
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,470
for a while this is my cat pseudo she is

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,819
a constant reminder that computers owned

47
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,080
me because when I tell her to do things

48
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:25,310
and that she doesn't do them it is

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,110
humbling and then I sometimes have over

50
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,560
two legs and a feel are wondering what

51
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,930
that means I use a cane sometimes so you

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,799
all might see that but uh I like to joke

53
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,799
that I have me a tripod

54
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,610
so I moved from development to security

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,220
and when I was moving from development

56
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,840
to security I really wasn't sure what I

57
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,040
was doing I wasn't sure what kind of hot

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,050
mess I was getting myself into

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,420
but I know I liked CCF's and I was the

60
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:59,040
CTF junkie and I liked lock-picking and

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:02,309
I liked getting into trouble so I at one

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,530
point met in cold water at work and Ian

63
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,720
said did you know you could get paid for

64
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,030
breaking things and subtlety my entire

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,090
life made sense and I was like I need to

66
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,739
switch into security now so when I

67
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,209
switched from development to security it

68
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,069
kind of went down like the wavy path of

69
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,280
like development to product security to

70
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,149
impress like proper I asked myself what

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,730
makes a good one

72
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,160
so naturally I googled it I wasn't sure

73
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,600
what else to do so I asked Google what

74
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,810
makes a good security engineer I think

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,819
that was my exact search query and the

76
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,090
first article that I found had this as

77
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,010
an answer which was build and maintain I

78
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,810
see security solutions for an

79
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,269
organization which I think we can all

80
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,430
kind of agree is like a fair definition

81
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:47,549
of things that we do like if not

82
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,380
directly then indirectly maybe like

83
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,230
support the solutions but like in some

84
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,060
form we do it but what this article

85
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,399
neglected to say is that after this

86
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,590
immediate definition the list I got of

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,040
other things I had to be able to do as a

88
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,989
security engineer looks like this and

89
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,459
that was terrifying I didn't know what

90
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,900
to do with that I like blanked out and I

91
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:13,470
was like hold man I don't know what to

92
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:16,108
do so there was this no one mentioned

93
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,488
Onkel that was part of it too that's not

94
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:22,469
something I've ever done before so that

95
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:24,450
was cool so moving into security I

96
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,340
noticed a couple different things about

97
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,080
like differences in culture differences

98
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,690
and like how many weirdos I'll find and

99
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,039
I'd love security for it but

100
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,630
specifically I found that in an ideal

101
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,360
world security would kind of look like

102
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,039
this where we are a cat in a box and we

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,389
never have to go outside of our box and

104
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,050
we have all of our systems and our keys

105
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,220
and our certs

106
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,870
and we never really have to go outside

107
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,150
of it we can sit very happy and our

108
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,039
systems and we're fine and then

109
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,080
sometimes it looks like this where we

110
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,699
have like the Greybeards in the box

111
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,750
that's like researchers and then

112
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,009
everyone is kind of like orbiting around

113
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,250
researchers hoping they're not going to

114
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,710
drop a zero-day on us and then other

115
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,690
times it looks like this where I'm sure

116
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,489
no one's felt this pain before but

117
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,490
that's that's security in a budget box

118
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,930
but actually security is varied and

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,650
different we all know that so security

120
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,849
where our cat in a box and we also have

121
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:23,270
people we have to interface with like

122
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:27,620
management how about sales HR marketing

123
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:31,430
and I feel like I am forgetting someone

124
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,330
it's the looming devs

125
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:38,129
because the people most likely to break

126
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,318
all of your stuff so this talk about

127
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:43,650
developers what developers like what

128
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,120
developers don't like kind of how we can

129
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,219
communicate better with them how we can

130
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,690
work better with them so developer has

131
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,180
joined the battle I'm representing them

132
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,130
today so let's talk about them a little

133
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,389
bit let's break it down what to

134
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,880
developers like and what don't they like

135
00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,779
this probably looks similar to all of

136
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,069
y'all if any of you practice scrum a lot

137
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,330
of developers like delivering on

138
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,039
deadlines they like feeling like they've

139
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,919
gotten something done on time that's

140
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,840
kind of human other things like creating

141
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,340
helpful features making users happy

142
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
seeing the impact of something they

143
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,719
built a lot of users like to see use

144
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,550
like a lot of users that are happy make

145
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:20,310
developers happy that's kind of how that

146
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,900
works things developers are not a fan of

147
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,330
are things like managing a sprint points

148
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,479
and velocity how many of y'all have done

149
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,948
scrum before okay cool

150
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,020
when I asked us at besides I got like

151
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,990
six hands in a full room and I was like

152
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,508
have y'all need to look that up

153
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,400
immediately pivoting off of different

154
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,690
projects is real again I'm sure no one

155
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,770
in this room has felt that before you're

156
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,129
working on something for two weeks and

157
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,359
someone goes you're working on that now

158
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,800
poor communication upwards and downwards

159
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,969
they might get really poor

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,759
specifications for something they're

161
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:52,620
trying to build and then fixing that off

162
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,810
by one bug that's been ruining their

163
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,460
lives have a past week ask me how I know

164
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:02,849
that pain so inevitably when security

165
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,649
and dev developers will have friction

166
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,729
because they are struggling with these

167
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:07,080
different things that they like and

168
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,609
don't like and security selling them go

169
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,089
slower while they were being told go

170
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,529
fast and break things inevitably there

171
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,749
will be someone in the industry that

172
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,520
looks like this that will say let's do

173
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:19,199
dev suck-ups it's a buzzword I think

174
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,149
it's this hot new thing and I want to do

175
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,659
it and this is going to fix all of our

176
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:27,619
problems so I hate to burst that bubble

177
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:30,929
but it often looks like this in practice

178
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:32,580
where you have the entire tech industry

179
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:34,580
throwing a red teamer onto a dev team

180
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:39,448
and going this is dev suck-ups right

181
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,580
it's not I hate to break that bubble so

182
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:42,689
Deb sack ups won't save you that is a

183
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,149
fact that I want to say right now

184
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:46,769
because dev SEC ops if you just kind of

185
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:48,779
like throw your security team at your

186
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,429
developers and go make it work implies

187
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,769
that all of those pieces were working

188
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,208
together immediately beforehand so if

189
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:56,099
you throw those pieces together and

190
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,659
there is friction there is misaligned

191
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,009
goals they aren't going for the same

192
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:01,139
thing they don't know how to talk to

193
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,659
each other dev suck-ups as a practice

194
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,559
might save you eventually but it's

195
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,839
definitely not going to do it in the

196
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:08,490
first place so I won't solve all your

197
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,479
problems so that's a no cap on the

198
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:15,449
bottom so we have to meet halfway

199
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:16,829
and that is really hard because security

200
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:21,119
and developers often have conflicting

201
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:22,800
goals so how do we do that I have kind

202
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:24,659
of three principles I operate off

203
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,459
personally they kind of align with the

204
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,219
soft skills panel if anyone is at that

205
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,050
last night and I'm going to talk about

206
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:34,318
those today so the first one is

207
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,639
accessibility so this is not the

208
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:38,250
accessibility I usually talk about Excel

209
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,469
a lot about being disabled but this

210
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,630
accessibility is kind of as an

211
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:46,319
organization as a security organization

212
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:49,230
in your company where are you can people

213
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:51,420
talk to you so what are some examples of

214
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,240
this you see multiple contact points

215
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,620
this can be email slack this can be

216
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,329
calling this could be where are you in

217
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,639
the building if you're fully remote can

218
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:02,758
people contact you via like video call

219
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,089
maybe this basically like Ken people

220
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:08,430
talk to you do developers know you exist

221
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:10,439
that's a question the presence in the

222
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,809
organization is huge do people know what

223
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:14,790
tools you use they might know you break

224
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:16,380
their builds but have date night you

225
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,270
personally

226
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,350
so isolates for communication are also

227
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,110
something that's incredibly important to

228
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,130
me if you have a reliable time in which

229
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,780
someone will respond to your security

230
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,340
questions they worry less about having a

231
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,420
security problem because they know

232
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,580
what'll get fixed in a certain amount of

233
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,990
time or at least addressed and then

234
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,180
interaction and gave you it teems if

235
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,980
you're not talking to your teams you are

236
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,689
missing a breadth of knowledge about

237
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,070
your organization that you're not going

238
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,390
to get otherwise because those people

239
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,220
will hide things from you so if we're

240
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,980
being accessible and we're talking to

241
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,930
our teams the other half of this is that

242
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,010
we have to be empathetic we have to put

243
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,910
ourselves in their shoes and try to

244
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,710
understand what they're talking about

245
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,180
and I love this because it's tuned man

246
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:59,430
but he was empathetic before he got a

247
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,890
heart so at empathy I can't stand up

248
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,839
here and tell all of you that you have

249
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,970
to be empathetic that's a choice you

250
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,890
have to make yourself what I can tell

251
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,020
you is that as they practice it isn't a

252
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,270
one-time thing and it's something you're

253
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,890
going to be doing every day so

254
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,470
practicing empathy is a lot of asking

255
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,750
why if your developers have pushed cred

256
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,760
stayed up u.s. seven times and it's

257
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,810
killing you and you're like why are you

258
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,680
doing this ask them why they're doing it

259
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,790
because they might tell you a whole

260
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,380
bunch of stuff out there pipeline you

261
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,000
didn't know maybe they need it to get

262
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,350
around to Jenkins build maybe they

263
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,270
didn't know they were doing it that's

264
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,680
entirely possible

265
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:38,220
my personal vendetta in this talk is

266
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,380
stop using just because it kills me so

267
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:45,230
when people say just put a my to proxy

268
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,230
just throw a cert on it throw off at it

269
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,150
the amount of work that goes behind all

270
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,610
of those things especially if you've

271
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,079
never done that is wild you are

272
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,660
invalidating all of the work that the

273
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,970
developer has to do in that context so

274
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,069
if you say just do this thing it implies

275
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,030
one that work isn't gonna be that hard

276
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,860
we all know that's a lie

277
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:07,050
and then the other one is that it's a

278
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,820
one-time thing so when you say just put

279
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,109
behind a proxy that implies like I just

280
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,450
have to do this this one time that'll be

281
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,890
fine that's not true for most cases with

282
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,260
developers they often have to do things

283
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,970
multiple times in the future so stop

284
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,680
using just personal vendetta and forcing

285
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,570
it on all of you stay maybe you'll stop

286
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,920
doing it the last time a shadow your

287
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,970
developers if you sit with your

288
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,170
developers and you sit with them with

289
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,670
their pipelines and you sit with them

290
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,680
and what they do on a daily basis

291
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,240
awesome cool please do that forever

292
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,069
because they will hide things from you

293
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,300
like I said before but this time they

294
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,250
can't hide it because they're staring at

295
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,240
their screen so you can see what they

296
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,980
have to go through to go through their

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,290
builds you can see what they have to do

298
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,970
to push things to master and that will

299
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,130
change how you approach your security

300
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,959
because then you can see okay they need

301
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,880
keys in this format so that they don't

302
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:52,109
push them to AWS they're to github

303
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,459
anymore cool and the last one now that

304
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,220
we are being accessible and empathetic

305
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:59,609
we're talking to people it's not being

306
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,870
their enemy and so someone actually when

307
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,100
I gave this talk at besides was like

308
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,600
that's funny because it's like

309
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,880
Security's checking out the developers

310
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,100
like that's what I see but what's funny

311
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,490
well 20 in this context is that the cat

312
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:15,720
is actually security developers are

313
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:17,160
choking us out so we don't need to make

314
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,080
any more enemies than we already have in

315
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,500
security we no threat landscapes change

316
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,000
daily if not hourly so we need to make

317
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,649
sure that we have everyone on our side

318
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,360
in our organization because we are all

319
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,170
on the same team we are all trying to do

320
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,480
the same thing hopefully and if we don't

321
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:35,430
we create insider threats and what I

322
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,110
mean by insider threats is that your

323
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,579
developers will hide things from you you

324
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,170
will have vulnerabilities and potential

325
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,359
exploits in your system that you don't

326
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,660
know about and that is an insider threat

327
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,680
if not by intention than by impact so

328
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,850
that is one of the biggest things that

329
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,140
I've learned recently it's that if

330
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,420
developers feel like they have to hide

331
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,910
from you then they are creating threats

332
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,310
inside your organization there's also

333
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,550
the idea of abandoned try harder I think

334
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,979
that's the osc P's motto but when

335
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,689
developers hear that they often hear I'm

336
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,649
not doing my job well enough and that's

337
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,600
an insult so if you say instead of try

338
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,579
harder you offer resources and you teach

339
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,070
and not scorn them for asking questions

340
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:15,270
and asking for your assistance that will

341
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,640
make a huge difference and that will

342
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:21,149
open a lot of conversations so then

343
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,880
hopefully we'll move from this why does

344
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:26,010
security hate me and why dads listen to

345
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:32,820
us we'll move to this like lovely purple

346
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:34,920
shade in the middle so I've told you all

347
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,630
these things that I do but I didn't

348
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,949
necessarily say hat like what works in

349
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,449
an organization so here are some

350
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,880
examples of what actually works and what

351
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:43,079
I've seen personally security advocates

352
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,590
are huge because they do your work for

353
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,689
you

354
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,910
please get security advocates if you

355
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,710
have doves on dev teams that care about

356
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,390
security and talk to you and like want

357
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,010
to learn more about security my god

358
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,540
embrace that and then send them off to

359
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,460
their teams and they will do your work

360
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,900
for you they will show people how MFA

361
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,730
works and then other people will listen

362
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,260
to them because they are a dev you don't

363
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,830
have to do anything it's awesome

364
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,060
so do that maybe transparency is super

365
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,610
huge if you're gonna block someone from

366
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,959
doing something tell them why

367
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,210
like I think Karen Liu's talk on

368
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,890
security logging yesterday and the Arab

369
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,130
gdpr she talked about sensitive data the

370
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,660
cannot log under any circumstance and if

371
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,020
I were a dev and I was being told you

372
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,490
can't log that why can't I log that like

373
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,300
just tell me why and then I won't do it

374
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,270
and then I'll make sure that in the

375
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,349
future I don't do that to individual and

376
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,230
team engagement you kind of talked about

377
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,850
that earlier seeing real-life impact is

378
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,160
another big one I really like to show

379
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,750
devs how a vulnerability works because

380
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,640
then they see that work and they go oh

381
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,320
god no and then they never do it again

382
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,850
it's awesome or if they do it again then

383
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,340
if you tell them again they're like ah

384
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,230
and then they freak out it's great the

385
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,970
last one is shadowing programs within a

386
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,580
reason see if you can get them to sit

387
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,930
with you and I say that because as much

388
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,860
as we need to see what developers are

389
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,510
doing they need to see what we were

390
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,130
doing as well they need to see what data

391
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,250
we see we need to see what endpoints

392
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,510
they like need to know about sharing

393
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,220
that information and letting everyone

394
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,360
kind of sit with each other is a huge

395
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,380
and like education point for that but I

396
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,720
do have to put a disclaimer out there

397
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,090
that your mileage may vary with any of

398
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,380
these things if you have a security

399
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,390
program that you think is mature and

400
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,370
works and you're like your dad's think

401
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,750
it works cool don't listen to me do what

402
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,170
you need to do your organization is

403
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,820
different

404
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,630
don't drop everything just because you

405
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,160
see this on this line so why do these

406
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,380
work you're engaging with that's on

407
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,880
their level you're investing in them you

408
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,320
are getting street cred among them so

409
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,820
that you're building trust is that when

410
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,900
you tell them to do weird hard stuff in

411
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,340
the future they actually listen to you

412
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,510
and they're not like super pissed about

413
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,390
it like there might be a little pissed

414
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,340
but not like super and then you're

415
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,770
investing in them and investing in your

416
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:47,400
dubs as QT team is pretty much doing

417
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,110
half of your work so we have a lien

418
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,840
vault here today right do you Bailey

419
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,000
about people in the room no okay that's

420
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,970
cool they're one of our sponsors they

421
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,550
gave us food so we have to love them

422
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:01,440
so a lot of organizations especially

423
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,870
bigger organizations kind of talk about

424
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,970
like how mature they're like sre

425
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,860
security stuff is but like alien vaults

426
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,260
a really interesting example because

427
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,800
they're a little bit smaller than like

428
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,760
Google and they have things like

429
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,479
management being accessible and

430
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,860
approachable so to have leadership be

431
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,300
accessible and approachable means that

432
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,760
all leadership kind of needs to know

433
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,930
about security that's cool because that

434
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,939
when your developers are like I have a

435
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,849
security question if the manager doesn't

436
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,579
know at least they know where to find it

437
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,720
security culture as habit so just making

438
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,519
it part of their routine that's

439
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,769
non-invasive that's team engagement

440
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,480
that's super cool and then keeping

441
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,769
training sessions brief this is my

442
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,720
favorite takeaway about alienvault

443
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:45,060
because they know that Security's scary

444
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,000
and dangerous and if you aren't used to

445
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,189
security it's really overwhelming I was

446
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,450
in a bar in a hotel once and naturally

447
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,560
like this is kind of person I am I

448
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,120
started telling you dude about have I

449
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,959
been pwned

450
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,040
and he was like I don't want to know

451
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,839
literally do not search my email I do

452
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,339
not want to know and I was like why not

453
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,180
and he was like because then I'd have to

454
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,939
do something about it

455
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,319
and I was like that's real right but

456
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,819
like security scary if you're not used

457
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,349
to it so keeping sessions brief so

458
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,309
people don't get overwhelmed also really

459
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:16,109
important oh my god I wish they were

460
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,459
easy like I wish these were easy changes

461
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,520
to make to have any Legally Blonde fans

462
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,400
in the room I say yes thank you so if

463
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,770
you don't know Legally Blonde watch it

464
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,360
so this is Elle Woods and she got into

465
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,679
Harvard studying well she was like

466
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,719
running on a treadmill I loved her so

467
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,549
much but in this case it's you fixed

468
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,540
your entire security culture what like

469
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,250
it's hard it's gonna be hard we're gonna

470
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,879
have some challenges you've likely seen

471
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,410
these in your day to day work there's

472
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,730
some friction between security and

473
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,860
developers that's just kind of been

474
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,860
historically there that's not super rare

475
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,820
we see that in a lot of organizations so

476
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,649
you're gonna have that friction deal

477
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,639
with like previous relationships we're

478
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,260
also gonna deal with communication

479
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,820
barriers if we have to go through like

480
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,410
30 bureaucratic steps to talk to any

481
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,178
given to him or like anything done or

482
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,309
make a meeting or six meetings to talk

483
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,130
about one thing you know communication

484
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,450
barriers are real resources available

485
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,679
for developers is really interesting

486
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,660
because there aren't always a lot of

487
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,500
great like

488
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,300
like edge of future technology security

489
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,560
things out there so as we'd have to

490
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,850
kubernetes and stuff we can see all the

491
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,860
conference talk so you want but like

492
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,909
every environment is different so

493
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,389
resources available to learn about

494
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,800
security is super real we look at

495
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,860
workloads and deadlines that's on both

496
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,090
sides pace of security super fast so

497
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,530
asking developers to keep up with

498
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,770
security and also do their day jobs

499
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,670
that's not gonna happen

500
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,530
technical background barriers is

501
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,330
interesting for security specifically

502
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,830
because like I said a lot of people just

503
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,820
don't know what scrum is and if you

504
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,169
don't know what scrum is how can you

505
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,780
expect your developers like prioritize

506
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:48,540
things properly you need to meet them on

507
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,370
their side to the interesting last ones

508
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,110
and security are the resistance and

509
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,699
inability to change and unwilling

510
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,010
managers because like heavy workloads

511
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,300
are just things I've noticed is that

512
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,860
every soft look at a manager that's been

513
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,810
in security for like 50 years and you

514
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,010
can't tell them anything you're like

515
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,600
here's this thing that we should be

516
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,550
doing to secure a cloud environment and

517
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,189
the person's like I've been doing this

518
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,690
since I was 15 and my dad's garage you

519
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,250
can't tell me how to do my job

520
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,510
that's super real you'll meet those

521
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,500
people it's terrible but those people

522
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,670
like that's something that they have to

523
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,780
adapt to it's something that we move

524
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,100
forward in the future with and if we

525
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,800
don't adapt to the future we will be

526
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:26,639
left behind so that's an interesting

527
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,980
challenge in security so with those

528
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,660
challenges why should I care why should

529
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,950
I do these things if I haven't explained

530
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,900
it well enough already this this is a

531
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,820
cat and all of her kittens watching it

532
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,130
chipmunk by the way in case you can't

533
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,540
see the chipmunk I couldn't at first

534
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,390
zero days and security best practices I

535
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,760
don't care give me the vulnerabilities

536
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:47,940
so why should I care security industry

537
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:52,070
it's kind of borked it's kind of wildly

538
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:55,470
broken if we look at just recent

539
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:58,379
security vulnerabilities like even Nord

540
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:03,450
got broken the other day like they're a

541
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,490
VPN but if we look at like all of these

542
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,550
things we look at like how culture is

543
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,710
leading difficulty at my university near

544
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,960
me we have the security team that when I

545
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,920
pee like help desk level one people ask

546
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,840
for help they go try harder

547
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,810
the last statistic on here I am a little

548
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,280
skeptical of because that is a phishing

549
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,720
report

550
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:31,290
by a fishing company and I don't know if

551
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,890
that's necessarily peer-reviewed to put

552
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,120
it that way but it seems fair that a lot

553
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,780
of cyberattacks at least start with a

554
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,760
fishing heater

555
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,129
so secured it's kind of worked and

556
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,620
that's why we should care in order to

557
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,540
unbar

558
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,459
my goal is the accessibility empathy and

559
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,550
friendship the power of friendship kind

560
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,840
of like not being their enemy will make

561
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,020
that difference and that'll be really

562
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,810
important to us and I'm excited to make

563
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,190
that difference with you and that is all

564
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,770
I have for you on this lovely Friday

565
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:08,219
morning

566
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:08,219
[Applause]

567
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,699
you
