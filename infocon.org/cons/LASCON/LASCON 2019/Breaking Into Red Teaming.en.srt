[Music]

2
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,580
I'll be your our pen testers here or red

3
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,730
teamers or I know you are blue team blue

4
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,800
team anybody like defense cool cool

5
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,239
so what we wanted to do is a

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,160
presentation about basically kind of

7
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,040
what we do and and we'll talk about that

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,860
kind of like the target audience here so

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,950
there's a bill about me and Johnny we're

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,239
both security offensive security leads

11
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,580
at General Motors

12
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,670
I consider myself Cavett car imagine you

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,080
know what that means so we we do like

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,030
all kinds of different kinds of things

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,399
that remoter spin testing red teaming

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,720
and the like there's our credentials and

17
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:15,149
our twitter handles if you want to

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,220
follow us so but we like our people like

19
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:18,570
people we like the projects and it's

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,979
kind of fun it keeps the challenging and

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,360
and you guys have picked up a career

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,390
that really is gonna keep you guys

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,950
always learning and trying to do stuff

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,050
and it's a it's a very challenging

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,869
career especially for my old brain but

26
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,179
it's uh it's definitely rewarding a

27
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:38,100
little bit our company you want to dress

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,470
this Johnny you know basically what our

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,330
playground is right so on the left is

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,119
the general motors what they do their

31
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,590
car company and I level in the middle so

32
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,479
one hundred and eighty thousand people

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,910
five continents twenty-three time zones

34
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,280
you know 70 languages that's kind of our

35
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,619
playground we do red teaming across the

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,560
entire globe that's you know physical

37
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:02,880
logical like we mentioned manufacturing

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,099
mobile kind of everything that GM has we

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,770
are able to test which is great it's a

40
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,330
big playground for us those time zones

41
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,949
come into consideration when you're

42
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,020
doing a red teaming because you know

43
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,399
different time zones gotta take into

44
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,770
account when people are in the office

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,959
that sort of thing languages makes a

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,180
difference we've been on boxes where the

47
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,400
language is not what we expected and you

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,840
know we've got to adjust and figure out

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,580
how to do how to go from there and then

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,290
of course just what GM actually is so

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,670
like Chevy GMC Cadillac those two brands

52
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,049
Camaro gender for the ton fits talk so

53
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,980
if you did nothing here interests you

54
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,390
can leave so we're gonna talk a little

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,700
bit about what the difference is between

56
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,440
pen testing and red teaming look how

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,510
types of engagements we have what are

58
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,769
some of the skills you need both if

59
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,030
you're building a red team or if you

60
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,580
want to be part of a red team maybe you

61
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,170
want to get into it so career growth

62
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,680
non-technical versus technical skills

63
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,849
that sort of thing uh so what is red

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,410
teaming some questions we have to answer

65
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,599
what kind of background knowledge is

66
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,209
needed what kind of skills do you need

67
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,910
for red teaming and how can you be an

68
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,989
effective red teamers possible so one of

69
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,970
the things I want to kind of bring out

70
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,260
there's a lot of like discussion in the

71
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,910
industry if you go to talk some red

72
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,230
teaming and blue tip and pen testing

73
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,450
there's always talks about what's the

74
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,530
difference between the two we in the

75
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,599
history of use these terms

76
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,829
interchangeably sometimes we've always

77
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
called ourselves a red team even before

78
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,239
we were doing actual red teaming it's

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,540
always it's always been the title we've

80
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,670
used but really and if you look at this

81
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:36,060
red teaming is is a broader type of

82
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,470
scope where the skill sets of pen

83
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,690
testing is kind of involved in all that

84
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,640
so if you're pen tester and you're

85
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,760
you're proficient of your job red

86
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,109
teaming is not a huge leap for you one

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,030
thing I will say though just on this -

88
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,920
you might not be as interested by red

89
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,150
teaming as you think you might because

90
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,190
what you're going to find is if you like

91
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,440
breaking things and testing things you

92
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,389
don't do quite as much of that on upon a

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,670
traditional red team engagement it's

94
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,069
what will get it at a minute but it's

95
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,619
more targeted so it's maybe objective

96
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,839
driven get this type of data and use any

97
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,310
means necessary to get it and whether

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,560
you find all the vulnerabilities and

99
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,930
exploit them along that chain doesn't

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,239
really matter we're more about you know

101
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,358
the objective getting that data getting

102
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,190
out or identifying this particular thing

103
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,570
as opposed to the pen test side where

104
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,430
you know we want to know all the

105
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,630
vulnerabilities along the way that you

106
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,960
got and exploited

107
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,539
within that application so yeah the

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,250
skill sets very very close to being the

109
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:35,210
same but the but the but the scope and

110
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:39,479
the objectives are often very different

111
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:41,820
we try to emulate threats right so you

112
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,590
hear about apt attacks and other things

113
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,060
that happen and we try to get some any

114
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,159
details as possible on these types of

115
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,389
attacks and try as much as we can to

116
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,860
emulate them now that means not

117
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,139
necessarily every little thing that they

118
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,060
do we do because for one thing it's not

119
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,110
necessarily useful to do it that way and

120
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,669
also we can't get a hold of tools

121
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,570
sometimes all right some guy in Russia

122
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,280
uses some tool he created

123
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,380
to exploit something and we don't have

124
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,659
access to that so we try that we try to

125
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,969
emulate the methods and the techniques

126
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,740
that they use also we're not Stein box

127
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,640
is a pin test pin test they say no you

128
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,360
have two weeks to pin test this

129
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,580
application

130
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,040
well sometimes we'll our engagement

131
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,650
single months you know you have you just

132
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,060
keep glowing basically you do you recon

133
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,190
do all these things to learn about the

134
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,080
targets like an attacker would you know

135
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,580
the guy singing in China or Russia not

136
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,500
to pick on countries but you know we

137
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,270
can't allow attacks from them they're

138
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,740
not they're not like limited in time

139
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,469
they have you know if they want to spend

140
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,810
years going after target they can so we

141
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,490
don't have years sometimes but we're

142
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,830
also looking for a prize right we're

143
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,270
looking for some goal in our in our

144
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,840
engagements and usually it's data of

145
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,090
some kind

146
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,119
all right so for GM it might be car

147
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,580
plans of some sort for Kentucky Fried

148
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,530
Chicken might be a secret recipe that

149
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,070
would get you probably a lot of a lot of

150
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,239
a lot of publicity for that one we also

151
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,700
work closely with defense

152
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,620
we're not like we honestly we've grown

153
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,180
weary used to be kind of competitive and

154
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,090
more adversarial with the defense team

155
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,680
and we've learned that we're really kind

156
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,380
of an extension of the defense team

157
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,960
we're like a tool of the defense team so

158
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,490
we work closely with them it might

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,180
include an engagement might include for

160
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,440
example physical testing right social

161
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,090
engineering we'll get into some of those

162
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,920
skills in a minute it might include pen

163
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,369
testing which it usually does it might

164
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,740
include

165
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,930
all kinds of skills that there aren't

166
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,340
scope possibly normally we don't go one

167
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,120
was like a scope you can do this this

168
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,739
and this and not this we usually say

169
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,280
where this might include this this and

170
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,080
this and this but you know and we have a

171
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,210
very strict do no harm policy with our

172
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,830
especially with our own company right we

173
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,270
don't - we're not gonna when I get

174
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,039
chloroform anybody had kidnapped them

175
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,990
and you know even though Anna might do

176
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,110
that so but we don't need any harm we

177
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,790
try to break anything we try not to

178
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,440
maybe some maybe some pride I guess

179
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,760
maybe a little bit but we tried to feel

180
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,920
harm we've heard a great black gray and

181
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,450
white box testing and that's often used

182
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,830
a pen testing like for example when you

183
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,050
know nothing about the environment it's

184
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,390
black box it's almost never black box

185
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,570
that's a honestly we know about the

186
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,750
environment so we go in with some we try

187
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,030
to keep it clean though

188
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,800
make sure we're not using you know that

189
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,359
something that an outsider couldn't get

190
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,440
is information alright cuz that's kind

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:27,020
of fair you know but it's usually great

192
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:29,090
a white box add to that or yeah really

193
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,370
try to do when we're doing black box

194
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,080
stick to that as much as possible but we

195
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,240
also recognize you know our own biases

196
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,859
that we've been there for so long some

197
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,230
of that's already in our brain and we

198
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,580
have to kind of work against that so

199
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,260
when we are building these out and

200
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,419
building out the reports we always make

201
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,550
sure we show the logic flow of how an

202
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,580
outsider would get the information we

203
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,600
used if we find something internally we

204
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,310
can't speak to how we got the

205
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,560
information on the outside we we don't

206
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,640
use it you know because it's it's hard

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,500
when you're doing your you know in

208
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,090
company red teaming because you're you

209
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,200
know you got to be very careful to keep

210
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,219
it clean cuz you gonna ask that you're

211
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,750
gonna ask well how did you find this

212
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,690
part that this flow out how'd you find

213
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,950
this out like oh well the guy sits next

214
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:12,140
to me at work I however doesn't work we

215
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,490
do it kinds of engage we do full scope

216
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,690
external to internal which means we

217
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,090
start with like something like a fishing

218
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,080
engagement we do we start with there or

219
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,690
maybe and I'll show you some engagement

220
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,090
flows in a minute but this is like the

221
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,400
full like you know and this and sea

222
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,239
level objectives love that because they

223
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,679
open they hear on the news about

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,850
somebody getting fished and all of a

225
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,810
sudden they have access to their mail

226
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,950
server and blah blah blah

227
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,210
they want to see that whole flow but

228
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,830
what kind of focus more on are these

229
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,289
soon breach types of engagement so what

230
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,289
that means is we assume people are gonna

231
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,000
click the email right do we test that

232
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,770
and we already know what the percentage

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,780
now it's like it's like forty percent I

234
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,420
think maybe more people always click the

235
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,270
email we're going to get in that way if

236
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,250
we have the time and patience so often

237
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,510
we'll assume that's been done and just

238
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,640
start from an internal system it's been

239
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,720
compromised and maybe we'll court if

240
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,220
somebody in turn once they go and run

241
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,900
this payload or whatever and what it

242
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,700
lets us do is it lets us work with the

243
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,920
fence to see how their detection is

244
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,450
working on this you know we can do

245
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,069
different things internally faster

246
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,720
without having to go through the process

247
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,030
of doing the the phishing email or the

248
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,310
USB drops or whatever now we do a little

249
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,870
drills also the fence will talk and say

250
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,189
hey could you do this kind of attack or

251
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,860
you know kerberos ting or something

252
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,230
we'll run a drill and do that for them

253
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,740
and they can tune their tools and their

254
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,230
detect

255
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,640
- and we do purple team engagements with

256
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,620
someone like looking over the shoulder

257
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,839
of each other you know we're watching do

258
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,250
this you know we're you know and we're

259
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,050
working more closely with them now - or

260
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,390
even maybe can work in the same room

261
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,380
sometimes and we'll do XY and Z and

262
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,819
they'll actually be watching what we're

263
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,800
doing as we're doing it yeah so just

264
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,140
kind of how this progressed like David

265
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,479
mentioned you know we called herself red

266
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,920
team in the beginning we start up really

267
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,890
doing penetration testing and that was

268
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,630
our titles from there we kind of well

269
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,730
we're doing vulnerability analysis to

270
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,560
penetration testing then to red teaming

271
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,920
and you know through the years as that

272
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,719
grew we added engagement types so you

273
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,490
know two or three years ago we weren't

274
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,130
doing assume breach two years ago we

275
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,839
weren't doing those dedicated drills a

276
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,700
couple years ago we weren't really doing

277
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,490
the purple team in one room getting

278
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,800
things done so as we've kind of grown

279
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,110
and matured the red team organization

280
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,120
we've also tried to branch out and work

281
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,800
with more and more teams and that opens

282
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,560
up the different types of engagements we

283
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,750
can do so that we're now testing other

284
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,790
parts of the organization as a whole and

285
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,300
working with more of those teams to make

286
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,199
sure they're getting the data they need

287
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,670
we've actually have got partnerships

288
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,050
with other companies and we meet with

289
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,790
their red team's on a regular basis to

290
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,979
the tour to work out they everybody does

291
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,390
things differently I mean I know there

292
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,630
are two they're companies that do like

293
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,529
constant I mean drills all the time are

294
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,970
there are other companies that will do

295
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,060
like a red team engagement unless an

296
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,700
entire year it's it's interesting you

297
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,959
know how they did the dynamic there and

298
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:03,290
we learn a lot from these other teams as

299
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:07,520
well so I had I had a picture I was ill

300
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:09,439
use it so why is it needed well I mean

301
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,910
again I this is already the attackers

302
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,350
the the adversary should become more

303
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:16,610
creative more more tenacious and defense

304
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,910
and again we're like an extension of

305
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,320
Defense they want to they want to know

306
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,939
how better they can detect these types

307
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,810
of attacks how they can how they prevent

308
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,649
them and block them

309
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,300
so we as a red team will as much as we

310
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:31,339
can to emulate these that we're prepared

311
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,349
in case the real attack comes and and

312
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:36,079
that way defense can detect it and stop

313
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,190
it that's really what we're about its it

314
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,550
simulation of

315
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,600
attacker with 8 questions by the way

316
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,060
feel free to ask questions as we're

317
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,230
going so because our we're not sure the

318
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,729
timing of this slides we could go really

319
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,400
short and you guys got early and you

320
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,920
know let me repeat that question yeah so

321
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,270
the question was do either Red Team Red

322
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,010
Team the vehicles as well as the

323
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,740
system's we actually have more than one

324
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,880
team at General Motors with engine

325
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,020
general is proper then there's like

326
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,850
sister companies and stuff that we have

327
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,530
other teams with that there's like a

328
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,940
product company team that does red

329
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,860
teaming for the products which is like

330
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,800
the Judaica part of it now we work with

331
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,210
them on engagements we might like do

332
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,740
something up to the vehicle or something

333
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,270
like that or you know we're learning

334
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,620
more about the vehicles and helping to

335
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,790
be more involved in that part of it and

336
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,020
work together with them but it's a

337
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,670
separate separate team that does that

338
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,949
though I don't know if you have anything

339
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,870
add to that yeah so the distinction is

340
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,700
if you know you had to sit in the

341
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,410
vehicle we have a product cybersecurity

342
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,410
red team that handles those sort of

343
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,939
attacks and then anything leading up to

344
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,430
the vehicle if you think of it as a

345
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,950
shell that's where you know that falls

346
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,209
into our domain where we're looking at

347
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,880
like I mentioned before infrastructure

348
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:44,510
manufacturing mobile anything going into

349
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,090
the vehicle from the outside web apps

350
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,710
that falls under our scope and the

351
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,120
environments are so intermesh to that

352
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,110
it's almost impossible not to get

353
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,240
involved with the other groups because

354
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,950
for example you look at a given example

355
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,750
like I know they're people here like

356
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,890
chance for example he's not works at GM

357
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,920
he does like a lot of the mobile stuff

358
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:03,140
well it's not just the phone because the

359
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,000
mobile apps attached to API is that are

360
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,100
running on web servers so that becomes

361
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,110
more of a an infrastructure issue at

362
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,550
that point and then you have api's in

363
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,290
the vehicles and you have apps that work

364
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,420
with the vehicles and so there's there's

365
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,370
a it's it's too much intermingling

366
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,689
really to just focus on one and not the

367
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,330
others as well or at least pull them in

368
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:23,450
so as we as we grow we're becoming more

369
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:27,980
and more collaborative on that that's a

370
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,960
very good question by the way okay

371
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,790
here's an example I just attack flow

372
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,589
forgive my artwork by the way it's kind

373
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,230
of generic and you know boring looking I

374
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:39,470
get it the red guys the red team's just

375
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,360
to make it easy so this is one example

376
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,650
and this is a camel Isha's file or media

377
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,390
type of attack where we are using a

378
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,300
malicious for example USB drive drop

379
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,910
somewhere

380
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,099
or I mean maybe see mrs. mr. robot will

381
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,649
just drop them in clumps right right in

382
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,089
piles at something but no you drop the

383
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,750
drives and they people see them and Oh

384
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,520
with who's this

385
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,020
you know what's belong to and they plug

386
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,540
into the system and hopefully run the

387
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,069
file that's on them or at the macro or

388
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,290
whatever we're using whatever method

389
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,270
reasoning or English in a fishing

390
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,020
example and malicious attachment on an

391
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,430
email and you know as their defense

392
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,020
grows more maturities are becoming more

393
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,529
and more difficult to pull off you get

394
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,520
to get more more creative with them so

395
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:23,730
help me remember the day when their auto

396
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,390
run on Windows I remember that Oh people

397
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,230
know it was a great time for us alright

398
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,560
we just dropped something about

399
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,420
automatically runs you know but yet to

400
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,790
be a little more clever and we have also

401
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,050
just to kind of point out we have like a

402
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,430
infrastructure as well like our c2

403
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,899
interest command and control

404
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,260
infrastructure usually running on a

405
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:47,160
cloud so that when the victim activates

406
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,200
execute the payload we get a beacon back

407
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,300
a shell back to our infrastructure

408
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,490
through through because they're calling

409
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,829
out over port that's allowed outbound

410
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,790
like 443 or something or what other

411
00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:05,430
other ports DNS maybe possibly right go

412
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:07,980
right questions about another type of is

413
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,209
a physical type of attack we do this

414
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,029
occasionally where we'll go to a

415
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:14,910
location and attempt to social engineer

416
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:16,110
our way into the building it's a lot

417
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,899
easier than you think it would be or

418
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,790
should be and once we're in at that

419
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,290
point we can at this point place so we

420
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,990
could do a lot of things we can take a

421
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,660
laptop with us and plug into the network

422
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,890
or bring it of like a lot of Raspberry

423
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,360
Pi device you know you can use one of

424
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,730
these mr. robot well you plugged it into

425
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,550
the thermostat on the show me your hands

426
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,410
remember that thank you

427
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,839
something like that you know something

428
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,250
you can place and leave leave it there

429
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,940
and then you know come back and actually

430
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,350
control the outside lots of things you

431
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,610
can do once your physical access some

432
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,560
people say when you got physical access

433
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,880
game is over pretty much and that's

434
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,810
really true actually true

435
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,870
alright a logical perimeter breach would

436
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:59,910
be for example finding a vulnerable web

437
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,170
app or server on the outside this isn't

438
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,769
as Commons that used to be obviously

439
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,509
this was the

440
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,790
to get into something you'd find some

441
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:06,869
server some some firewall role of his

442
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,179
left open

443
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:12,059
I'd even early in the early in my career

444
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:15,179
I I saw systems with SMB open on the

445
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:17,480
outside and I even found one act it was

446
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:19,499
a domain controller with external ports

447
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,799
all the ports open on the main

448
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:23,879
controller were open on the outside so

449
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:25,769
not as common anymore

450
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,170
thanks to kind of default firewalling

451
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:31,529
settings and such but this is one way

452
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,360
possibly a vulnerable web app would be

453
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:34,499
an example you know finding something

454
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,110
that you can get at some kind of web

455
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:38,730
shell on and then escalate privileges

456
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:42,269
yeah we just had obviously this is a

457
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,499
very generic a basic example with cloud

458
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,600
infrastructure and everything that's

459
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:47,730
going on now most companies don't have a

460
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,160
typical perimeter like this anymore you

461
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,230
know not everything's on the inside but

462
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,629
just trying to illustrate you know one

463
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,980
style of attack but it does get more

464
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,660
complicated you know it's not like it

465
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,670
used to be like David said and you have

466
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,290
all these moving pieces usually have a

467
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,579
cloud architecture piece out there

468
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,648
somewhere that's hooking into your

469
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:07,049
internal system and you know how do you

470
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,398
traverse those networks and and that

471
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:09,689
brings up the issue like you know AWS

472
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:11,789
buckets that sort of thing that we're

473
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,230
you know they'd have repositories

474
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,148
there's all kinds of things where stored

475
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,740
data is stored we might not even aware

476
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:20,549
of and our companies that are our

477
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,679
pathway in to the environment any

478
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:24,539
questions about these these attack flows

479
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,010
and there are others this is examples of

480
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:27,779
some basic ones there are some probably

481
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,120
some hybrid kinds of things we could

482
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,440
talk about as well and we don't stick

483
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,080
with this one and basically in a Red

484
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,789
Team engagement it's it's if we if we're

485
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,799
able to actually get access very quickly

486
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:40,408
will try more than one usually more than

487
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,799
one type of approach to to provide more

488
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:50,250
value to our defense team and our

489
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:51,929
company cool guys are very quiet I had

490
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,529
no candy to give us questions so it's

491
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:58,110
gonna be just you know we have both

492
00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:00,360
technical skills and non-typical skills

493
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,830
talk about it away if you want again to

494
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,000
be in a red team or have a red team what

495
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,879
kind of skill sets you need to bring to

496
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,300
those we'll talk about those in detail

497
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:14,520
next slides here thank there we go

498
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,080
now it's interesting this is pentesting

499
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,030
as well most people that start off in

500
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,080
security in general are usually what

501
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,440
what areas they come from they come from

502
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,120
development or IT are there any other

503
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
areas that you know that you can think

504
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,820
of that where you see a lot of people in

505
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,870
security coming from besides those two

506
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,850
areas QA okay I already consider that

507
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,560
part of like security is but yeah yeah

508
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,510
you're right you're right you're right

509
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,440
auditing for example might be another

510
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:43,760
area where legal I don't know maybe leak

511
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,770
her lawyers coming in and being good yes

512
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,960
there you go

513
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:51,900
yeah yeah this is just like a very broad

514
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,890
a couple of different because we work

515
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,510
with people that are both from a

516
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,760
development standpoint and from an IT

517
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,930
standpoint and it's but it's interesting

518
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,180
working with developer I'm not a

519
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,830
developer if you looked at my Python

520
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,830
script scripting you might want to tear

521
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,810
your eyes out it's really messy it's

522
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,340
probably like you know 150 lines

523
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,639
probably could be compressed down to 20

524
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,990
or something like that but they think

525
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,310
differently you know you bring a

526
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,570
different kind of mindset to the table

527
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,129
in your developer and it's good because

528
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,870
sometimes we don't think like developers

529
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,550
enough and when developers come in and

530
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,600
help us with our engagements not only

531
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,240
can they help us build infrastructure

532
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,280
and find fast joys of doing that but

533
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,910
also just looking at problem solving and

534
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,379
looking at the ways things are set up

535
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,120
but yeah wide variety skills are brought

536
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,290
into red teaming useful if you're

537
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,209
getting social engineering for example

538
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,570
that's a good skill talk about those in

539
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,330
a minute here we go so these are some

540
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,800
random kind of skills that that we found

541
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,460
useful I don't know so much about

542
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,240
lock-picking

543
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,100
is Jake over here no we never kids never

544
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,300
come up for us yet I think there are

545
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,100
certain things in a red team engage like

546
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,500
a physical one they're kind of yeah you

547
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,870
could do that but does it really help

548
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,760
that we like climbing fences and going

549
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,070
through roof tiles and that sort of

550
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,090
thing you get hurt for one thing and it

551
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,710
doesn't really provide provide much

552
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,810
value because what controls do you

553
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,360
install to prevent that from happening I

554
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,760
guess you could put barbed wire like a

555
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,990
modern lock-picking would be RFID yeah

556
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,550
cloning that sort of thing yeah so

557
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,680
there's a lot of skills up here that we

558
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,960
find useful I mentioned a couple things

559
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,870
like cobalt strike it's what are we used

560
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,720
often for c2 infrastructure knowledge of

561
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,909
operating systems

562
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,920
all really really useful and having a

563
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,890
team that has a diverse set of skills is

564
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,540
really useful because you can cross

565
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,620
train each other for one thing because

566
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,300
we don't want one person on the team

567
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,280
knowing everything about this and no one

568
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,510
else knowing it like like for example

569
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,740
one person knows that sub infrastructure

570
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,530
and no else does Lou he has a problem

571
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,720
and no one can help them because you

572
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,610
know we're stops at that point but

573
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,590
having more than one eyes on everything

574
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:55,120
it's kind of thing we're moving more

575
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:56,199
toward any questions about that you know

576
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:04,149
skills you can think of that might be

577
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:05,890
useful for yes I find it really not

578
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,130
really I'm trying to think I think we've

579
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,480
got some physical we we have done this

580
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,790
on a physical engagement we did look

581
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,110
through some of the bins inside the

582
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:18,610
building for stuff by yeah yeah I think

583
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,429
we've done that when physically gain

584
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,000
access to a facility looking for

585
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,560
whatever you can

586
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,480
paperwork lying around but I don't think

587
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:30,100
either of us is actually physically not

588
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:34,330
not into about a gym no no yeah yeah is

589
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,949
that a skill though I guess having the

590
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,020
intestinal fortitude to jump into

591
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,310
dumpster is a skill yeah because I've

592
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,070
done that the previous in croute

593
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,540
previous jobs before Eng M and if you

594
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,340
see the movies you see the movie hackers

595
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,460
did solves like sheets of paper to like

596
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:51,070
know it's old sandwiches and and coffee

597
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,300
grounds and you know there's nothing

598
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,830
Pleasant about duster dumpster-diving

599
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,960
you wear gloves and you know this

600
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,570
parkour like if you're that stuff and

601
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,360
parkour is the circle or yeah yeah yeah

602
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,129
yeah I often I was I was talking to

603
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,030
somebody about once about sorry it's a

604
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,480
little diversion I talk to somebody

605
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,190
about about doing like skill sets and

606
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
having and being able for example

607
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,070
because people say for example you're

608
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,620
you're you know you're a script kiddie

609
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,020
if you do this way and I thought really

610
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,540
because I you know if you think about it

611
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,370
if you're like a skilled diamond thief

612
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,990
right and you you see a museum you're

613
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,699
planning for months to get in the museum

614
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,920
you've got you got your grappling hook

615
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,810
and you learn to do like the parkour

616
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,430
moves to the laser beam you know like in

617
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:33,550
the movies they do a little the thing

618
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:35,200
with it I'm not gonna break my back and

619
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,490
you got the glass cutter to cut the

620
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,810
perfect circle glass

621
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,590
you're gonna scale the building and get

622
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,600
the suction cups to get

623
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,330
an event and you get the museum on the

624
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:47,469
knife your your you know your your your

625
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:48,730
project and the doors left open you know

626
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,870
and the diamond is right there the

627
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,900
guards asleep and dimes right there

628
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,070
they're rock cleaning and he fell asleep

629
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,539
are you a lesser thief because you're

630
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,500
gonna go in and grab it I mean are you a

631
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,029
script kiddie because you're gonna use

632
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,730
simple methods that are available to you

633
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:02,470
so yeah I always think never think like

634
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,809
you has to be really sexy and an

635
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,820
elaborate to win you look for the simple

636
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,928
stuff it's something sometimes dump

637
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,250
strive because a good example that's um

638
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,870
put a password on it you know piece of

639
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,490
paper and left it under monitor for

640
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,899
example it's sometimes it's the easy

641
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,320
things we overlook because we're looking

642
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:21,189
at the more you know elaborate things we

643
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,529
can brag about sorry all right

644
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:28,440
questions about any more questions it's

645
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:32,909
a good question by the way so training

646
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,169
I'm gonna get probably some some some

647
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:39,549
teasing and leering because I put we put

648
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:40,600
CHS is this certification and I know

649
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,250
it's like one of those things that's

650
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,070
like really really I mean people make

651
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,570
fun of it let's make fun I honestly if

652
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,789
you look at the book for CEA just not

653
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,460
bad it really isn't bad information to

654
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:52,840
know it's not a bad set of knowledge to

655
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,860
have I wouldn't I wouldn't make fun even

656
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,449
what anyone who went after that as long

657
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,860
as that was like their there in goal and

658
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,140
then what claiming to be able meet

659
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,129
hacker because they had a C eh that's my

660
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,630
only thing but yeah there other things

661
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,220
up there too sands always obviously

662
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,260
peace a good one it's very hands-on

663
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,789
Specter ops is a training that company

664
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,809
offers it's really probably one the most

665
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:11,919
respected training for red teamers

666
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:12,720
there's other things you can do kind of

667
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,730
on your own

668
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,980
CTF competitions hack the Box bone hub

669
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,720
you think events to Johnny yeah just

670
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,919
that it's all relative right so yeah

671
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,799
somebody that may be brand new to

672
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,480
security might find ceh very helpful

673
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:28,059
right it gives you the terminology it

674
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,520
gives you the organizational layout of

675
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,690
how security operates but yeah you're

676
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,860
not gonna be elite or anything so I

677
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,809
think it's all relative when you're

678
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,299
looking at formal and informal training

679
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,710
on where your skill set is and trying to

680
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:41,649
figure out what will get you to the next

681
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,140
level and we try to include just a lot

682
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:45,789
of you know we're not specifically

683
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,870
advertising the formal training we're

684
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:49,210
just trying to give an example of each

685
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,500
skill level of what's out there there's

686
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,900
obviously a lot more yeah other

687
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,780
different certs and

688
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,880
in formal training a lot of those are

689
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,610
like packed box that it's free and good

690
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,809
and can get you started buddy no or it

691
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,010
might not know hack the box reviews it

692
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:02,670
before anybody here that not seen that

693
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,300
before

694
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:08,010
yeah that it's a it's basically like the

695
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,870
like the osep labs you you're given an

696
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,850
environment you basically VPN into the

697
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,040
systems and you try to break into them

698
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:15,809
Windows boxes Linux boxes they're

699
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,129
they're usually up to date with current

700
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:18,600
types of vulnerabilities too

701
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,040
it's not like you're gonna find peanut

702
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,300
death or you know they're something like

703
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,909
that these are like current things are

704
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:26,100
happening that they build and it's free

705
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,390
and if you're preparing for like the ICP

706
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,199
it's a really good way of getting in and

707
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,059
get your getting your feet wet

708
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,250
for free before you start buying lab

709
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,720
time so yeah and personally I got a lot

710
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,670
out of blogs a lot of people will just

711
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,520
you know create their own sites that are

712
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,010
either on github or some you know rough

713
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,450
blog posts and if you get a good

714
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,129
collection of those together try to give

715
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,200
you a couple examples it's always a good

716
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,270
reference point because you'll start to

717
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,160
see people are very strong in one area

718
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:53,100
and you collect enough of those you kind

719
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,390
of get a good round of training just by

720
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,030
seeing what other people are learning

721
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,220
and observing it's sick by the way I

722
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:02,070
really recommend that what he does is

723
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,780
it's a YouTube YouTube channel what he

724
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,520
does is he goes to these boxes in the

725
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,928
hack the box if they retired they don't

726
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,270
want you to do walkthroughs of the

727
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:11,160
current boxes but when they retire them

728
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,170
he'll go through and do walkthroughs of

729
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,240
them for anyone who wants to watch and

730
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,980
they're really informative watching this

731
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,440
guy getting to the box and watching it

732
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,790
way the way his mind works and he'll try

733
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,720
more than one way of doing more than one

734
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,940
vulnerability you'll learn a ton of

735
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,130
stuff it take tons of notes watching his

736
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,540
stuff I learned like you know I that's a

737
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,570
good point too because he's talked about

738
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,340
soft skills I learned free I went to AI

739
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,889
wait a study group here in Austin for Oh

740
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,559
ASP and we did a remedial like a very

741
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:42,510
very beginner basic low-level Kali Linux

742
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:45,360
training for just we picked that book

743
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:47,250
and I was like do I need to do that it's

744
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,479
like really basic and I know all the

745
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,550
basics I don't need to I'm like a

746
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,350
learning from this I was so wrong how

747
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,428
much I learned from this basic stuff

748
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,780
because there are things I was doing

749
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:57,690
that like I could have done so much

750
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,490
easier doing it this way you know yeah

751
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,910
we're talking about the attitude never

752
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,080
always learning but there's there's so

753
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,820
many resources out there now that

754
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,990
they're available

755
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,389
that weren't available to me when I

756
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:13,280
started out so any questions about these

757
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:14,450
or anybody have any other quick yes why

758
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,750
that's a good question

759
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:20,570
for Fred teaming so the we because we

760
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,190
think it's a very very basic very very

761
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:24,620
good starting point for just let's say

762
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,290
new security I guess right it's like a

763
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,330
foundational kind of thing all right so

764
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,470
I would say I guess the question is if

765
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,360
you're if you're at if you're

766
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,650
interviewing for a job and you're

767
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,479
interviewing for red team position I

768
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:39,830
could see them ask you once you have a

769
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,600
CSP yet you know I think also it adds so

770
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,320
it's it's shallow but broad right is

771
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,030
heavy

772
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,530
there's a lot of things in there that

773
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,389
aren't going to be technical but you're

774
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,040
still going to use one example is the

775
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,660
risk so understanding the risk and

776
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,310
organization different ways to calculate

777
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,480
that risk you're gonna use that when you

778
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,100
find a vulnerability and have to

779
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,940
categorize it and report on it yeah

780
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:01,399
right so it's not a bad

781
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,320
hey that's true HR filter it also does

782
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,180
have a physical piece where you kind of

783
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,310
learn about you know different gauges of

784
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,530
fencing and how how to secure building

785
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,639
and you know each little section kind of

786
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,560
has a little nugget that could be

787
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,810
applicable so I think it's worth being

788
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,110
on this list but it's not something that

789
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:19,159
I would compare to like an OSU P or

790
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,600
something from sands where it's gonna

791
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,490
tentacle deep dive and give you the

792
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,379
hands-on knowledge to do some of these

793
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,360
exploits plus your Avenue to communicate

794
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,520
with other security groups of the

795
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,139
organization as well you get that some

796
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,190
kind of foundational you know knowing

797
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,680
the terminology we'll talk to them and

798
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,820
knowing the terminology is important so

799
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,700
if you don't know the terminology behind

800
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,020
the behind threat behind risk you got a

801
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,210
very difficult reporting on that

802
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,129
reporting out to sea level

803
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:51,260
administrators sorry executives yeah on

804
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:54,440
this yeah question hours interval from

805
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:57,650
our experience yeah I think he wants

806
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,340
GM's what cm's okay yeah let you take

807
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,340
that me

808
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,360
no I can start it so you know obviously

809
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,420
we post all of our openings on the

810
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,129
official website and here you know at

811
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,900
last con we have an opening right now on

812
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,730
the whiteboard with our names on it if

813
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,380
you're interested just at a high level

814
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,480
we're looking for a lead penetration

815
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,070
tester but the interview process I think

816
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,680
it's pretty standard from my experience

817
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,790
at a few different companies you know

818
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,230
we're here

819
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,750
today right now and you can obviously

820
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,250
talk to us after this kind of this talk

821
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,780
and reach out to us and we'll give you

822
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,870
some more information but pretty much

823
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,370
apply through the site we do you know an

824
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:37,100
interview technical interview in the

825
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:39,070
beginning where we look at technical

826
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,469
skills but also have those soft skills

827
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:45,290
and then from there move on to an

828
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,640
on-site etc so pretty standard I can go

829
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:50,659
into more detail you know if anybody's

830
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,890
interested after this yeah yeah and I

831
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,900
think I think also it's important to

832
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,850
note that that attitude and soft skills

833
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,860
be able being able work with people is

834
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,719
as much if not more important to us than

835
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,709
even the technical part of it yeah I

836
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,070
think the keynote mentioned that

837
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:05,840
yesterday how finding vulnerabilities is

838
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,250
great but if you don't have some of

839
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,020
those communication skills and

840
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,220
collaboration skills getting those

841
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,400
vulnerabilities fixed it's gonna be a

842
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,390
lot harder what's the use of having 15

843
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,910
certs up your name if no one wants to

844
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,220
work with you well I don't how much we

845
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,780
go into that well obviously we try to

846
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,330
say high level I don't think we've

847
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,950
divulged any secrets or anything I have

848
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,659
to believe people slide though people

849
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,580
are gonna fish try to fish organisations

850
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,190
people are gonna try to gain access you

851
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,929
know their web apps yeah so we keep it

852
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,760
high level but also try to give

853
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,490
real-world examples of what could be

854
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,020
used so when we showed the physical all

855
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,370
of those are real-world examples of

856
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,210
what's going on you can look it up in

857
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:45,590
the news if you use the example of the

858
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,150
exploiting a web server and then getting

859
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,760
into the network you know that's a

860
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:52,160
viable threat that every organization

861
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,810
faces so we're not you know we try to

862
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,940
keep the high level not say specific

863
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,740
things about specific applications that

864
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,750
may have vulnerabilities but just try to

865
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,190
give you overall things you have the

866
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,160
work flow things that could apply to any

867
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,780
company really yeah yeah our company

868
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,880
isn't as a hundred year old company and

869
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,889
the culture is often hundred years old

870
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,000
but we're like we're like but no

871
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,020
seriously I mean every time you like

872
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,180
that every time that the dole is like

873
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,450
that but we're we're coming at it's it's

874
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,739
we're

875
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,139
getting more involved in the security

876
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:20,119
community now we're working to share

877
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:22,189
more people and yeah I think just our

878
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:23,959
group alone has done maybe five or six

879
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,820
yeah last couple of years they're just

880
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,330
the red team around different

881
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,950
conferences us yeah and you know the

882
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,720
legal partly is like it's changed the

883
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,799
format a little bit and have fun with

884
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,330
that a little bit so we're they're

885
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,840
loosening up so yeah we don't have any

886
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,970
memes

887
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,379
yeah totally that's one side effect yeah

888
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,159
but we try to keep it interesting with

889
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:41,869
visuals yeah

890
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,100
actually David created so if you guys

891
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:45,678
like these visual if you like about

892
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,619
graphics and I do some stuff on the side

893
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,299
as for fun but not so much for profit

894
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:52,129
unfortunately you might remember like

895
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,470
the old there was like the CDs that came

896
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:56,149
out with that were gosh I can't think in

897
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,200
the name of them now it's like volha but

898
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:58,459
they're late this guy he was the first

899
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,440
one to do this you really see CDs that

900
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,539
were vulnerable systems and you booted

901
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,309
your box up to this box and it loaded a

902
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:05,929
vulnerable server as I was hearing an

903
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:07,428
interview of his it was funny because he

904
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:09,619
said that he do you see people calling

905
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:12,710
him asking him okay I booted the box up

906
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:13,999
now what's the password I'm you guys so

907
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,049
we'd understand you have to figure out

908
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,279
what the password is

909
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:17,720
yeah but I got to get in what's the

910
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,980
password I was like it was like a

911
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,809
vicious circle you know you don't know

912
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,639
you have to get to hack into it to get

913
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:27,769
the password yeah but I can't log into

914
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:29,498
it I know you know yeah ball hubs very

915
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:31,340
similar to that pin tester Labs

916
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:32,389
petitioner Academy those are paid

917
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,730
services you can go to and they're

918
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:36,529
mostly web app related services they're

919
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,879
really good though okay I stopped

920
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,559
schools imma let Johnny lead this part

921
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:41,090
and all the chyme inland sure yeah so

922
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,960
like we mentioned there's you know two

923
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,459
sides of the coin you got to have the

924
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,460
technical skills to find vulnerabilities

925
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,279
exploit them get the data then you gotta

926
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,809
have the soft skills to really drive and

927
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,119
make those changes within the

928
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:55,190
organization and present all the

929
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,470
findings and how critical they are and

930
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,600
you know get that point across so ad

931
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,039
important one is communication there's

932
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,709
internal communication you know within

933
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,149
your team and then external

934
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:07,909
communication as well so when we're

935
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:09,619
running an organ you know an operation

936
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:11,330
for internal communication within our

937
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:13,580
team we try to make sure our channels

938
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,049
are secure some of that OPSEC stuff you

939
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,529
know end-to-end encryption making sure

940
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:21,019
we're not leaking any information with

941
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,940
within our project we're actually you

942
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:24,980
know taking the precautions we should to

943
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:28,730
secure the information we're sharing

944
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:30,980
and then within our team organization of

945
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,480
clear tasks of who's doing what so if

946
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,940
you get a shell back who's taking that

947
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,610
shell what are they doing with it its

948
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:40,520
persistence key or is exfiltration a

949
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,929
number one step and just trying to keep

950
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,780
track stay organized there's things like

951
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:47,090
JIRA and Microsoft tasks and a million

952
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,129
other ones really just making sure

953
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,500
everybody has something to do and knows

954
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,570
what should be done so you can keep

955
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,550
going on to that goal and then

956
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,679
establishing a common language is for

957
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,649
example defense like blue team or

958
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,970
intelligence one example there is some

959
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,370
people say payloads some people say

960
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,650
malware some people say implants and

961
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:09,918
when you're in a you know the heat of a

962
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,450
project it's very important that you're

963
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,179
all speaking the same language so that

964
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,009
you're if some deconfliction needs to

965
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,200
take place of is this a real actor is

966
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,360
this you guys when they say a term

967
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,649
you're all in the same level field you

968
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,330
understand what they're saying they

969
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,950
understand what you're saying and then

970
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,299
just kind of listed a couple of you know

971
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:29,060
high-level frameworks that take care of

972
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,820
that mitre is very good about types

973
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,350
within that cycle of this is persistence

974
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,540
and here are a few actions you can be

975
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:38,000
take within that here's how you gain

976
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,009
access and then the kill chain which is

977
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,080
older now it's been replaced by mitre

978
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,360
that was a little more high level to

979
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,239
mitre and but follows a lot of the same

980
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,890
buckets of categorization so there's

981
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,080
just two examples of how to make sure

982
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,239
that within your organization you are

983
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,469
communicating and saying the same thing

984
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,959
so it doesn't get lost in translation

985
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:58,430
also to communication with executives is

986
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,230
they're important to kind of understand

987
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,490
how that works because you don't speak

988
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,880
executives the same way you speak to

989
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,620
like blue team or your teammates we had

990
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,640
to learn early on like in reporting to

991
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:13,910
stop using words like password dump or

992
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,500
or password crack any here's here's a

993
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,029
good rule of thumb anything any word

994
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,010
that you use it would make any nine year

995
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,420
olds that are in giggle probably need to

996
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,670
change those words something else a more

997
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,380
professional so but yeah let's technical

998
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,150
too I mean I mean they don't really care

999
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,280
when you're doing executive report you

1000
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,560
don't repair about about the getting in

1001
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,690
the weeds you know the risk that what

1002
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,710
happened and very basic language not

1003
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,960
that they're stupid or anything just

1004
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,490
because they that's all to care about

1005
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,590
right

1006
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:40,899
know about the yeah instead of saying

1007
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,470
dump maybe you can say extract a

1008
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,650
straggler

1009
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:46,899
you know we had trouble also I mean how

1010
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,160
the view as a penetration tester have

1011
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,510
trouble explaining people what you do

1012
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,368
for a living because just what's called

1013
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,830
right it's real Kevin awkward thing to

1014
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:55,780
call you know you say well I'm I'm I'm a

1015
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,130
I'm an ethical hacker or that brings up

1016
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,840
all the questions so I use I'm in

1017
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:04,119
security that's why I say you know I've

1018
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:06,040
given up trying to explain yeah I mean

1019
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,240
collaboration so that communication kind

1020
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,070
of ties into the collaboration

1021
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,959
collaboration is more keeping that

1022
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:13,330
communication ongoing and making sure

1023
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,310
that all of those different teams those

1024
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,360
moving parts that ultimately have the

1025
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,210
same goal of making the organization

1026
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,980
more secure and better that you guys are

1027
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,590
always on the same page always

1028
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,240
communicating with example the defense

1029
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,330
when we do purple team engagements

1030
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,459
that's constant and quick feedback where

1031
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,619
we can do something during that purple

1032
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,050
team blue team will say okay we saw this

1033
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:36,850
or we didn't see this and you know

1034
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,500
that's that's one example of

1035
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,600
collaboration and then intelligence is

1036
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,580
they have an organization where they're

1037
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,650
collecting all that information that we

1038
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,650
can then use in our operations so if

1039
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:49,390
they know a specific threat actor is

1040
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,490
targeting X type of company in this

1041
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,470
region well that's useful information to

1042
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:55,509
us because we want to make sure that we

1043
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,850
are testing those types of attacks and

1044
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:01,300
that we are giving you know blue team or

1045
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,160
defense the right view there and then

1046
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:07,330
security architecture as another example

1047
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,970
takes example of maybe not during the

1048
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:12,670
attack but before and the enterprise

1049
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:14,439
level how can we identify these things

1050
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,090
so that they don't become a

1051
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,940
vulnerability down the line that we we

1052
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,730
find right so just a few examples of how

1053
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,500
working together with the organization

1054
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:26,050
can stop vulnerabilities from coming out

1055
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,580
before they happen and then once once

1056
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,100
they are out identifying them and

1057
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,750
quickly taking action on them whether

1058
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:37,839
that be through like detect or prevent

1059
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:39,760
measures so organization this is you

1060
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,109
know one of the major things when you're

1061
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,460
doing these testing whether it's

1062
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:44,830
penetration testing or red teaming

1063
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,869
specifically is you want to have time

1064
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,490
steps time stamps for everything you

1065
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:49,050
want to be able to provide as much data

1066
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,970
as

1067
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,070
to the teams that are going to need it

1068
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,529
for the follow-up so if you said you did

1069
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,910
this style of attack they're gonna want

1070
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,350
to know when did you do it what did you

1071
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,480
do it against what was your source IP

1072
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,520
what was your destination what port did

1073
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,680
you use what service what was a version

1074
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,930
of that service all the data you collect

1075
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,000
is very important and can be you know

1076
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:11,549
later used to to fix problems or

1077
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,200
identify what was happening but with

1078
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,550
that you have to be very organized you

1079
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,939
know at your team and individual level

1080
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,740
to understand that you're gonna have all

1081
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,570
that data available when they need it

1082
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,310
so how do you stay organized you know at

1083
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,870
the individual level

1084
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,020
some people use like cherry tree and

1085
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:29,100
Cali some people use OneNote Evernote

1086
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,410
there's a lot of different ways some

1087
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:35,279
people do pcaps of all the network data

1088
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:36,899
going across it's important to just kind

1089
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,640
of standardize that within yourself and

1090
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,870
within your team so that you're all on

1091
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,690
the same page of a type of data that's

1092
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:44,549
needed no-nothing the bid is the fittest

1093
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,470
behind in the earlier years was the fact

1094
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,960
that we'd say okay we did this at 12

1095
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:50,459
p.m. is that Eastern or Central because

1096
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,590
the hacker teams in East you know so

1097
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,690
agreeing on for example like using all

1098
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,460
UTC for everything we do is the move

1099
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,690
agree on that way we're not having any

1100
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,400
kind of confusion there with regards to

1101
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,540
win this actually happened yeah so we

1102
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,830
have team members in different countries

1103
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,259
doing different things and then we

1104
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,759
agreed on yeah timeframes to use for

1105
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,620
those within our team but then when we

1106
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,540
passed it off to another team they were

1107
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,880
using another time zone and UTC

1108
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,830
reference so we had a standardized logs

1109
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,180
for that time for all for like hours you

1110
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,700
can't find anything for that oh it's

1111
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,169
because it's three hours this way right

1112
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,310
and then just you know with all that

1113
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,330
data you're collecting you're gonna

1114
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,040
start thinking about what type of

1115
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,610
metrics are gonna use to measure these

1116
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,320
things

1117
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,320
and we'll touch on metrics a little more

1118
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,220
so plus they've done the project you

1119
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,100
found some cool things you did some

1120
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,930
exploits feel leet you got a turn you

1121
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,529
know everything you use from the

1122
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:43,319
technical into kind of what everybody

1123
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,240
else uses day to day a PowerPoint or a

1124
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,250
word document some sort of report that's

1125
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,109
going to get to either the business

1126
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,930
owners that are dealing with those

1127
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:53,840
applications or the executives that have

1128
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,310
to make these changes on enterprise-wide

1129
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,560
so you've got to figure out a way of how

1130
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,480
you're going to communicate those and

1131
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,910
how you're gonna translate you know

1132
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,680
command shell screenshots or

1133
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,930
you know command-line things into a

1134
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,910
presentable way that'll keep executives

1135
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:11,520
engaged and interested and understand

1136
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:14,308
the impact of what you've done it is the

1137
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,780
least fun part of this and so find some

1138
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:19,230
good musical doesn't delay your day yeah

1139
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,579
this one can be tedious because it's not

1140
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,760
as fun as exploding and popping all the

1141
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:25,140
things oh yeah and there was metrics

1142
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:32,640
there yeah yeah

1143
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:34,049
I wish actually actually here's the

1144
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,730
thing we we only have two people on a

1145
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:37,740
team they often we will often delegate

1146
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,210
them to do the report and then I

1147
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,589
remember one poor guy we put through the

1148
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,210
ringer because Johnny's really good with

1149
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:44,460
like formatting I'm pretty good with

1150
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,780
wording with wording wordsmithing and so

1151
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,539
between the two we made him rewrite this

1152
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,799
thing probably twelve times yeah that

1153
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:51,690
was bad that was his first it was really

1154
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:53,250
it was rough it was then we went our

1155
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:56,910
manager who what bad for us not for the

1156
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,890
guy I mean I mean but yeah that's a good

1157
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:00,868
point to it when we write reports we try

1158
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:04,078
to do we try to do team a peer reviews

1159
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:05,369
as much as possible well like like well

1160
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,990
I'll set it to Johnny Johnny we'll send

1161
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:08,579
it to another guy and then will you know

1162
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,078
will circulate and we'll have a common

1163
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:12,089
meeting we talk about the differences in

1164
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,529
opinions or whatever one come out but

1165
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:14,759
even then even then we do that they go

1166
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:16,529
to like upper management like how does

1167
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,059
scrap this whole thing and yeah so if

1168
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:19,920
you look at type of reports that's kind

1169
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,299
of what our target audience is right so

1170
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,609
we have a target audience that needs the

1171
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:25,770
technical report let's say defense where

1172
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,990
they need the exact command run at the

1173
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,819
exact time with the source IP great we

1174
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,220
make a report for them so that they can

1175
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:34,380
have all their answers there and then we

1176
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,480
make executive reports where they need

1177
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,069
to know just high-level what were the

1178
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,779
big findings and then how can they

1179
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:42,180
address them yeah and then we typically

1180
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:44,789
map attack flows in as a visual

1181
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,410
representation like we showed earlier so

1182
00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:48,869
that even non-technical people can

1183
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:51,240
understand step one step two step three

1184
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:53,700
visually you know unlike a Visio diagram

1185
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,049
and understand oh okay that led to this

1186
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,439
got it

1187
00:41:55,049 --> 00:42:01,589
and then metrics are just you know how

1188
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,210
we quantify and how we help the

1189
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:03,690
organizations determine if they're

1190
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,920
getting better

1191
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,559
what was our mean time to compromise

1192
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,569
mean time to detect how long were we in

1193
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,970
the network or the system before a flag

1194
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:15,359
went off it was it better than last year

1195
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,439
last month and then successful versus

1196
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,328
failed attempts

1197
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,099
de temps are often just as good as

1198
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:22,680
successful attempts as far as a data

1199
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,839
point because failed attempts means

1200
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,940
maybe something did works and stopped it

1201
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:29,910
and something was triggered and was

1202
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,290
blocked right but successful is the sexy

1203
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:35,220
stuff where it's like oh it worked and I

1204
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:37,920
got in and got access right and then

1205
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,480
just kind of the overflow of trying to

1206
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,859
fix the problem which is the most

1207
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,210
difficult part I think it's very easy to

1208
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,950
find vulnerabilities and exploit them

1209
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,750
but getting them fixed is probably what

1210
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,189
takes forever right so you make the

1211
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,079
report you found it to get it to the

1212
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,630
right people and then usually it's not

1213
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,819
just switch like oh I'm gonna click this

1214
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,960
and everything gets fixed it's a long

1215
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:57,329
process of either changing

1216
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,280
configurations or updating versions or

1217
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:01,680
seeing some interconnections that

1218
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,420
weren't there before so we got that

1219
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,149
cycle of you know you discover your

1220
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,970
report you prioritize based on risk and

1221
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:11,310
then you try to remediate and retest so

1222
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:13,348
if the business owner remediated this

1223
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:15,750
one problem when we have to go back we

1224
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:17,849
engage and retest and make sure yep that

1225
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,650
that's not vulnerable anymore we're good

1226
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:21,270
to go we can close out the issue but

1227
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,849
this I think is what takes most of the

1228
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:26,599
most of the time it's not always just

1229
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:28,710
popping boxes it's trying to figure out

1230
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,170
within the organization you know the

1231
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:34,349
best way to secure these things and fix

1232
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,480
the problem yeah I think like we said

1233
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:38,310
and for our organization we don't handle

1234
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,380
inside of the car so we probably don't

1235
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:42,900
have the best answer for you on that

1236
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,880
we take care of everything going leading

1237
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,740
into the vehicle that would probably be

1238
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,089
the product red team would have better

1239
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,890
answers for you up will be different

1240
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:52,170
lead times on sure right if you find a

1241
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:54,000
vulnerability in a car and they're all

1242
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,960
on the highway you know if the bed net

1243
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,369
vulnerability you know we have you have

1244
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,599
a like a recall or something right I

1245
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:58,470
mean you have to do something or maybe

1246
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,300
there's a way of downloading the

1247
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,618
software every three so yeah GM does do

1248
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,510
over-the-air updates there's certain

1249
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:04,890
vehicles and there's that technology

1250
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,829
that's coming about I don't know all the

1251
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,078
specifics of it and there's also GM has

1252
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:12,000
a bug bounty program through hacker one

1253
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,670
for identifying any of those issues so

1254
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,250
if you do identify that you want to

1255
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,020
report it hacker one General Motors they

1256
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,940
have something there for vehicles as

1257
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,440
well as infrastructure side one clear

1258
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,490
difference between like our company a

1259
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,829
lot of other companies that deal with

1260
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,390
security it has to do with safety right

1261
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,220
I mean if something goes wrong there's a

1262
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,890
software bug or even you know

1263
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,169
Karkat you're off the road and kill

1264
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,430
somebody so that's a big that's it's

1265
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,960
obviously gonna be a obviously different

1266
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:39,990
end of with a car type of vulnerability

1267
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,369
that what effect it's you know it's

1268
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:45,000
gonna it's gonna be probably a much more

1269
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:47,880
critical you know short lead time to get

1270
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,900
fixed I'm sure but yep we're good

1271
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,640
five minutes left so I'm trying to

1272
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,460
breeze through this last couple things

1273
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,500
so career career growth is just kind of

1274
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,089
some what we've learned as we're going

1275
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,950
through and obviously we're still

1276
00:44:57,089 --> 00:45:00,450
learning and that's kind of the most

1277
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,430
important part which our next slide is

1278
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,410
in this field cybersecurity in general

1279
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:06,629
whether it's application or red teaming

1280
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,339
it's just continuous learning so you

1281
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,880
know take initiative where you can offer

1282
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:13,680
to help others and then if there is

1283
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,539
feedback you know actively seek it what

1284
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,480
can I do better whether that's in the

1285
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:19,920
soft skills or technical skills attend

1286
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,329
conferences like this and try to learn a

1287
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,180
new thing I was learning a lot about

1288
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:26,010
mobile app security yesterday or was

1289
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,078
that today's talk that was interesting

1290
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,940
there's a lot of study groups even here

1291
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,559
in Austin locally that you can get

1292
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,710
involved in and just kind of dive into a

1293
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,450
different area and then you know build

1294
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,160
your brand is the typical what do you

1295
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,839
want to do how do you see yourself if

1296
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,640
you want to be a red teamer you know

1297
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,410
maybe you can start putting out some

1298
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,190
blog posts about what you've identified

1299
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:51,779
in recent phoner abilities or exploits

1300
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:54,180
you've done or bug hunting etc they got

1301
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:55,710
a last slide second last slide is just

1302
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,279
bonus points which is you know the

1303
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:01,470
InfoSec community is huge if you want to

1304
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:03,930
do this sort of thing there's plenty of

1305
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,700
outlets for you to get your you know

1306
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:07,169
feet wet in that sort of thing there's

1307
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,029
conferences like this where you can do

1308
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,309
the CTF or you can do the lock-picking

1309
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:13,260
and get some experience there and see if

1310
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:14,430
that's something you like there's

1311
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,049
everybody here at the conference that

1312
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,569
you can network with and ask them what

1313
00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:20,430
is your day-to-day like I can't speak

1314
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:22,500
for every city but this city if you're

1315
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:24,450
in security you can never use the excuse

1316
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,400
there's nothing to do to get to learn

1317
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,629
more that's never an excuse here there's

1318
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,130
always things going on there's always

1319
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:31,049
groups meeting there's always things

1320
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:33,869

1321
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:35,069

1322
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:36,029
Instruments every Thursday right now we

1323
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:37,619
were working on the badge challenge

1324
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:38,940
stuff and I don't

1325
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,499
gonna do after this is over but that's

1326
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,819
something else you get involved in so

1327
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:44,098
there's always there's other groups

1328
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:47,670
there's I say there's ISACA

1329
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:48,930
there's there's a 2600 I think there's a

1330
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,880
lot of other groups Trent how do you

1331
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,529
involve this so yep it's overall you

1332
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,900
know multiple paths to red teaming if

1333
00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:55,859
that's what you want to get into and you

1334
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,720
know we have some opportunities at

1335
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:59,400
General Motors that we'd be happy to

1336
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,439
talk about after this if anybody's

1337
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,849
interested you need a wide range of

1338
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,130
technical but also some of those soft

1339
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:07,499
skills where you can drive and get

1340
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:09,359
things done and then just get involved

1341
