[Music]

2
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:43,860
check then okay great that looks like a

3
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,500
lot of things that I do right they're

4
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,000
actually more like a developer you know

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,239
I'm still a developer I started when I

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,870
was like nine years old and I used

7
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,540
programming to test things experiment so

8
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,519
even if I'm the CEO you and I still have

9
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,040
to deal when we create new products or

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,610
you know I still play and we try things

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,740
we we you know we get we get things

12
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,229
really sometimes doesn't work so we have

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,970
to keep going so that's I'm still you

14
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,479
know very hands-on in that regards as

15
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:19,259
you can see so what I'm what I'm going

16
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,210
to talk today so just let me know if if

17
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,790
there is something I say which is not

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:28,339
clear so I'm Italian so you know I'm

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:31,710
doing my bestest big okay in English and

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,990
hopefully the technical jargon it's

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,970
easier for me so so let me let me try to

22
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:43,068
to kind of introduce what I'm what I'm

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,679
gonna do I think this is pretty new so

24
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:53,550
have you heard about privacy GDP are all

25
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:57,630
these regulations so yeah the problem

26
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:00,959
with I mean if you're aware of this is

27
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,300
that everybody's talking about GDP are

28
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,740
about fines about you know kind of

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:10,109
fixing it with it's a consumer facing

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,730
approach with disclaimer privacy

31
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,400
disclaimer I'm not sure if you received

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,230
just before GDP or trigger a lot of

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,440
email saying our privacy policies

34
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,470
changed and stuff like that so that's

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,170
how privacy it's pretty much address

36
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,760
right now so you have kind of legal

37
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:32,190
framework okay and then you have the you

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,609
have tools okay which are kind of a

39
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:38,340
little bit old because they're designed

40
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,230
to for compliance so it's it's kind of

41
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,480
document base you have to enter a lot of

42
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,609
things that you do but it's all based on

43
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,429
on whatever the

44
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,100
the officer provides you know to the

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,750
tool so it's it's it's just like world

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,130
pretty much it's like editing in

47
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,320
document so and you probably heard about

48
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,540
all the leaks that are going on you know

49
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,660
it's really it's really bad and GDP are

50
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,510
actually is not being enforce as as it

51
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,290
should be so it should be like 20 up to

52
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:13,470
20 million euros per incident or 4% of

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,000
global or global turnover but it finds

54
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,190
there are some huge fines but then if

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,920
you look at the small businesses the

56
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,290
fines are like 100 K 400 K so I think

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,989
I'm not really happy about about that I

58
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:29,090
mean I think it's very I mean I think

59
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:32,400
that privacy privacy variability is as

60
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:36,959
serious as a security mobility so it's

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,820
it's the same so it can be even worse so

62
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,760
what I'm trying to do today it's gonna

63
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,299
it's gonna be kind of it's gonna be

64
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,070
interesting

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,590
I'm gonna try to kind of get down from

66
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,440
tank you know 2,000 feet to let's say

67
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,870
1000 okay and say how can we do

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,769
something today with privacy okay but

69
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,920
really hands-on

70
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,380
so because honestly I wish you know we

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,899
were looking at okay let's see what we

72
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,400
can use for our company or let's see

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,140
what we can do in terms of privacy and

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,180
there's pretty much nothing available

75
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,660
freely available if you look I don't

76
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,060
know

77
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,220
privacy detect or privacy scanner or

78
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,070
whatever you find a lot of consumer

79
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,720
facing tools right like doctor go or VPN

80
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,480
so stuff like that but you know you

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,919
don't typically find anything to address

82
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:31,550
the privacy within the application so

83
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:34,229
like how is the application kind of

84
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,860
managing personal data so it's not about

85
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:39,599
you know access injection it's about how

86
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,500
that social security number is actually

87
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,419
being processed within the application

88
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,200
okay so right now the tools what they do

89
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:51,150
the this huge let's say you know the

90
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,099
mass smaller tool what they do they

91
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,620
pretty much scan your repositories but

92
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,990
the application is you know no one knows

93
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,490
what goes on so you actually yeah

94
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,050
Kishen could just send the social

95
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,280
security number to China and you

96
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,110
wouldn't know right

97
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,880
so the kind of I see a sort of

98
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,460
correlation with applicational security

99
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,469
somehow so you know like we always were

100
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,760
always pretty much addresses but on the

101
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:18,600
privacy side so and the good news is

102
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,060
that we we have a we have a lot of

103
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,110
technology today that is just out there

104
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,710
and it's not a police you know in the

105
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,750
publicly it's not being implemented used

106
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,400
so if you look at it and get have

107
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,130
anything with privacy related you're

108
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,609
probably gonna find a lot of good let's

109
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:41,430
say infrastructure like let's say AI

110
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,560
infrastructure or you know really good

111
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,210
stuff but low level but you're not gonna

112
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,190
find something that solves a specific

113
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,460
use case and in privacy I think they're

114
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:54,150
like I just found just one project from

115
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,590
IBM which was kind of you know trying to

116
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:01,859
do something but it's really an

117
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:03,659
experiment right so so that so what I'm

118
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,860
pretty much when I say grassroots

119
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,660
approach you're gonna see that it's

120
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:13,560
gonna be let me keep going it's gonna be

121
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,320
about how can we do you know kind of let

122
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,660
the developer own privacy it's a very

123
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,400
controversial term because privacy

124
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,590
typically how it works when it's

125
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,690
implemented you know there's the upper

126
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,000
management the data protection officer

127
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,250
you know they they pretty much negotiate

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,570
with vendors and then they say to the

129
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,110
developer this is what you have to do

130
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,940
right and that might be too late or

131
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,000
might not be the right thing you know so

132
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,800
so what I'm proposing is actually a

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,260
bottom-up approach I'm not saying that

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,960
the developer kind of just a developer

135
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,180
architect project managers disconnect

136
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,299
from the organization but I believe that

137
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,980
you can do a lot you know without really

138
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,240
you know waiting for the the corporate

139
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,430
you know the the upper management to

140
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,830
tell you what you have to do so and when

141
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,140
that happens you could you can actually

142
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,210
act upon that right you'll be more

143
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,099
prepared so well this I think this

144
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,440
definition doesn't doesn't need any

145
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,039
comment right I think it's a little bit

146
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,869
too

147
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:20,998
generic but I think it's fine so there's

148
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:24,119
this professor and Kevorkian was the

149
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:28,619
first person to introduce privacy by

150
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:31,680
design and she introduces way before

151
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:34,529
gdpr okay and but now GDP are included

152
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,270
that German in the regulation so pretty

153
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:41,308
much you know it's I think this is also

154
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,960
pretty common in in you know kind of

155
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,789
quality attribution security right you

156
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,758
want to be correct if you don't want

157
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:50,878
wait for you know to get into some

158
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,860
variability so that's when we have when

159
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,930
we say preventative we mean that you

160
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,550
want to protect personal data you want

161
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,249
to want to make sure that the personal

162
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,409
data is not compromised okay so and you

163
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:02,939
don't want to wait for that data to be

164
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:04,860
leaked because that's gonna be too late

165
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,469
it's gonna you know it's gonna be a in

166
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,889
the Deep Web or somewhere for someone to

167
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:13,529
to use your identity right and probably

168
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,270
says they fold is like that's pretty

169
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:17,849
interesting if you download any app it's

170
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,089
it's pretty typical that all the privacy

171
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:23,669
settings are actually against you so

172
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:25,499
it's a it's quite interesting so you

173
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,318
have to go to the privacy settings and

174
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:30,479
then in some hidden corner you know

175
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,099
where what actually it's grayed out you

176
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,549
know and you have to press like three

177
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,289
times you have you know disable privacy

178
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,848
you know and they say are you sure yes

179
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,130
I'm sure you know are you really sure

180
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,959
yeah I'm sure so that's that's how it

181
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,449
works right now and that's what pricey

182
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,569
my fault is saying is that by definition

183
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:50,609
should be private right price embedded

184
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,349
into the son is is just AB is it's

185
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,240
actually there's some you know it's a

186
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,240
clear little bit redundant it means that

187
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,889
the application should already be

188
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,510
designed to protect personal data when

189
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:03,839
when that data is passing through the

190
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,430
application right for functionality that

191
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,720
means that let's say if you want to use

192
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:11,370
a VPN to protect your origin right you

193
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,839
don't want your IP address to be to be

194
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,670
exposed right because you don't want to

195
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,519
do you want to keep you know private

196
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,680
it's not really privacy but yeah that

197
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,600
means that you don't want to lose any

198
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,430
functionality because of that so if you

199
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,310
block for instance I don't know if you

200
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,900
use an ad blocker

201
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,300
right you don't you don't want the

202
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,640
website to tell you no you have to see

203
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,650
my ads so I'm going to kind of create a

204
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,120
really bad user experience for you so

205
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,000
you don't want that to happen so that's

206
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,120
that it means that if you want to be

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,460
we keep private you should you have the

208
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,140
right to be private without your user

209
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,300
experience to be effective okay that's

210
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,250
that's what by default but I

211
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,550
and then end-to-end security is pretty

212
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,880
much making sure that you know from

213
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:58,680
point A to point Z you know you you are

214
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,720
you're covering all the all the kind of

215
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,670
the information flow you don't leave any

216
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,520
any part because you might be you might

217
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,500
encrypt maybe 99% of the communication

218
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,170
but then at some point you're I don't

219
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,450
know you're sending some some personal

220
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,339
data plaintext and and that's actually

221
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,110
the same as nothing it's the weakest

222
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,120
point I mean it's it will compromise the

223
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,830
whole the whole architecture so which is

224
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,060
the same in security I guess right

225
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,300
visibility and transparency well that

226
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,670
has to do with you know I'm not sure if

227
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,500
you notice but it's very difficult to

228
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,740
access all the data they have about us

229
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,270
you know Google stores a lot of data

230
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,250
friends of Facebook they have a lot of

231
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:42,460
data but which is not only the data we

232
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,260
enter is actually the data that comes

233
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,200
out from the analytics process and they

234
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,140
are profiling us they're linking our

235
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,210
data so in a very interesting way so you

236
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,490
don't you know they know much more than

237
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:57,490
what we think and I would love to have

238
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,010
some sort of you know option where I can

239
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,380
just opt out or I can remove whatever

240
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,330
set of data I want and that's part of

241
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,250
gdpr which is right to be forgotten

242
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,890
somehow so you have the right to be

243
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,020
forgotten but that's you know it's going

244
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,230
really really slow but I'm not gonna

245
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,110
talk about that because that's like like

246
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,500
more on the on the exploring the legal

247
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,450
more and on the user experience am I'm

248
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,040
gonna focus more on that the privacy

249
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,950
embedded into design because this is a

250
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,520
huge as you can see this is like to me

251
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,680
and look like like a new way and somehow

252
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,720
it's something that it's built on top of

253
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,760
security it's the same to me it's not

254
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,050
privacy and security this privacy can

255
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,540
augment insecurity

256
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,519
right well and this is old information

257
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,429
so and read so many leaks we are not

258
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,160
aware of and because you know now with

259
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:53,350
GDP are they are actually forced to you

260
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,988
know to kind of you know expose that

261
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,480
leak but losses are much more than that

262
00:11:55,989 --> 00:12:01,420
I know so and this you know we had we

263
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,790
after that we had a you know Equifax so

264
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,738
many other events there have been some

265
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,368
very significant fine for British

266
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:11,559
Airways was like 300 million euros so so

267
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:13,209
there are some significant fines but you

268
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:20,199
know small businesses as I said they're

269
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:20,979
not they're not still very affected so

270
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,359
this is interesting

271
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:28,720
oh this is something I just some of the

272
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,079
things I mentioned before so we have

273
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,360
several several challenges now so I

274
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,819
think the first one is really tough

275
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,850
is that what actually happens also

276
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:41,618
somehow with security so privacy its nth

277
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,230
well it only happens it's kind of

278
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:45,939
permeates the whole organization so that

279
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,119
means that you know and not only

280
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:50,969
realization you have to also consider

281
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:53,439
you know all your or let's say your

282
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,209
service providers you know for its of

283
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,579
the cloud you're sending personal data

284
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,829
to the cloud and who's responsible who's

285
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:02,739
liable of that right how do you check

286
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:05,949
whether let's say Amazon is protecting

287
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,470
your I don't know your your a repository

288
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:09,609
your stream facility for instance or

289
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,160
encrypting you know there many things

290
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,929
you do not know and cannot know so

291
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,549
that's that's a whole challenge because

292
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:17,110
it's not enough to just protect the app

293
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:21,399
you also have to protect all the

294
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:24,819
different endpoints well this I already

295
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,929
mention a regulation and the only body

296
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:28,329
of knowledge I mentioned before is

297
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:32,850
priced by design there's this you know

298
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:35,469
these very high level information and

299
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,660
kind of it it's it's a yeah I bought

300
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,519
your knowledge it's it's very very

301
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,600
high-level directive but it's not

302
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,699
actionable at least that's what I think

303
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,439
as much of about there are no tools the

304
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:50,740
tools yeah there are tools you have to

305
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:51,490
buy from some huge some big you know

306
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,310
come

307
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,399
an vendor and the tools are very

308
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,500
difficult to to install to implement

309
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,410
because they have to access your

310
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,440
repositories so they also need to be you

311
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,899
know - you know kind of it you know

312
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,720
there are a lot of Indies and and things

313
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:13,270
that have to be signed off for for that

314
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
vendor to work with you know and do a

315
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,819
some proof of concept so it's there's a

316
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,709
lot of friction

317
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,200
even if use a tool and that all that

318
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:23,949
tools will just as much before they will

319
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,839
focus on on just the pretty much data

320
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,240
there are scanners you connect with the

321
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,430
database and they they just can look for

322
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,830
you know some some it's kind of a

323
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,719
fingerprint of personal data which is

324
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,760
fine but you're just you know it's a tip

325
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,290
of the iceberg as far as far as I'm

326
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:44,230
concerned and the other thing is that

327
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,020
there's privacy and their security and

328
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,270
it's like different words and

329
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,060
preme disconnected and I think there's a

330
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,069
lot to learn from security that can be

331
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,369
applied to privacy it's not me there's

332
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:59,980
something I'm gonna mention that that is

333
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,920
it's a it's called privacy threat

334
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,770
modeling and this is it's a it's it's

335
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,449
not new but pretty much you know I think

336
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,920
it's extremely powerful I mean

337
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,490
conceptual frame it's a conceptual

338
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,160
framework right on top of stride but and

339
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,899
specifically for privacy but it's still

340
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,149
you know you can see that there's not

341
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:21,040
much structure I believe that you know

342
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:24,160
once again we can leverage the threat

343
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,260
modeling discipline in privacy really

344
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,760
and and it's really good good work and

345
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,339
I'm gonna discuss about that a little

346
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,470
bit so what I'm proposing here is that

347
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,300
in kind of aspiring the you know

348
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,750
Cathedral in the bazaar its era

349
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:45,370
claimants it's a it's it's sort of paper

350
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:47,860
that it's based on how open-source

351
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,320
pretty much the Linux kernel was

352
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,320
successful and and how pretty much the

353
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,310
the government's model worked so we were

354
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:00,100
you know so it's we are used to broader

355
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,260
Kiko model well you know this is the use

356
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,990
case here the specs just implemented

357
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,740
even if you do a job I mean it still

358
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,740
still

359
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,850
you know top down somehow so with open

360
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,589
source and you know I've been a

361
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:16,839
contributor since 2004 and we created an

362
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:20,050
open source project and then you know I

363
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:22,570
prescribed a company behind that so I'm

364
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:25,750
kind of aware of that it's a totally

365
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,490
different way of working you know

366
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:31,029
because it's it's much more horizontal

367
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,640
and you know you get features you which

368
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,839
might be interesting you you know it now

369
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,720
it's pretty common with the pull request

370
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,390
from github but at that time is like the

371
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,779
whole process is is is totally totally

372
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,010
let's say bizarre like I mean it's like

373
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,980
chaos but it works

374
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,480
eventually it works so eventually you

375
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,550
get you know at some point the

376
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,110
application it's it's a little bit of a

377
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,079
Frankenstein right but but then it's

378
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,730
just it's very aligned with what users

379
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,399
want because the user is actually the

380
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,010
developer you know he's you know kind of

381
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,109
scratch his itch right and say well this

382
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,990
I I need this so I'm gonna do it here's

383
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:09,520
the contribution so we had a lot of that

384
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,179
and I think it's it's a great model if

385
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,109
we can apply these two to privacy so

386
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,569
kind of that

387
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:19,958
the boxart is it's a kind of war that it

388
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:22,178
looks a little bit you know harsh

389
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,000
because it's like chaos but I think it's

390
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,980
uh you know it's promotes this

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,650
collaboration communication you know

392
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,650
among all the actors and I believe that

393
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,090
once again it has to be grassroots you

394
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,220
know if you want it to work because

395
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,830
there's no time okay there's no time and

396
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,260
developers that already are let's say

397
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,840
security conscious they they can already

398
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,820
make a lot of progress with with privacy

399
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,230
without buying expensive tools that

400
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,428
that's what I'm saying you know you can

401
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,070
you can build or you can leverage

402
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:55,780
whatever it is out there and and and

403
00:17:51,070 --> 00:18:00,040
then the tool eventually will follow so

404
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,720
this is kind of comparison so you know

405
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,250
when you implement privacy typically

406
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,059
have a policy hyper or whatever and a

407
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,450
regulation you have to implement it

408
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:09,040
right

409
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,530
the problem with regulations that they

410
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,540
don't tell you how or they tell you that

411
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:17,110
what somehow but it's it's a little bit

412
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,800
gray so what what I proposed here is

413
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,229
okay so communicate

414
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,000
flow change from hierarchical to graph

415
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:27,980
which is you know what the bazaar model

416
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,940
mindset proposes you know going from the

417
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,970
silo to you know to to connect privacy

418
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,790
with the enterprise security

419
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:40,570
architecture so kind of start working

420
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:45,530
using that as a sort of baseline and

421
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:46,850
then right now you know as I went to

422
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,770
before companies focused a lot in

423
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,330
infrastructure like data repositories

424
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,100
and what I'm saying is that you should

425
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,389
start from the applications from the

426
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,449
application that you'll know where the

427
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:59,600
data is flowing and you protect just

428
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,890
whatever it is actually being exposed by

429
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,659
the application maybe you have some

430
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,570
let's assume you have some database

431
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,970
which is under the desk of some IT guy

432
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,689
you don't care about maybe you care

433
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,340
about depression later within in that

434
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,540
workstation but that works rotational

435
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,510
server it's not really connected to

436
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,340
anything so you know it's not so bad I

437
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,750
mean you can you have more interesting

438
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,360
things to care about so the application

439
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,310
will tell you by the information flow

440
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,050
which you know which infrastructure

441
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,970
pieces are interesting to you because

442
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,370
you know the application is pretty much

443
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,110
Yorkist radar of everything so so that

444
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:37,219
one it's a way to prioritize those and

445
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:39,320
then also here's the right now you know

446
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,910
companies they think that you know they

447
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,320
buy a bunch of solutions they protect

448
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,530
the no it doesn't work that way it's

449
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,590
security same thing so I I still believe

450
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:52,160
that you know you have to you know try

451
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:55,689
to you can buy stuff but I believe in

452
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,030
building some sort of internal let's say

453
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,010
capabilities okay so in before buying

454
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,100
eventually you buy your adopt you build

455
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,830
but you have to to really be aware and

456
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:11,899
say knowledgeable about security and

457
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:13,790
privacy before you buy any tool right so

458
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm going I'm not sure I'm going a

459
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:20,420
little bit fast but so here's here's and

460
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,600
do you have any questions so far about

461
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,550
the kind of really the whole concept you

462
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,399
know I'm kind of proposing is it clear

463
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,830
or just just interrupt me it's it's

464
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,280
great because it's a it's something that

465
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,429
it took me

466
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,030
time to kind of you know put it in in in

467
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:40,950
you know in these words so just just

468
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,740
interrupt me it really I just wanted to

469
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:47,220
make it you know to way so here's you

470
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:51,060
know I and bring a Huey I so as I

471
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,640
mentioned before I I'm lucky that I can

472
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,399
I can pretty much experiment and I'm

473
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,560
very involved in research so one of the

474
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,740
let's say outputs of our research was

475
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,929
this prime a P I product it's not we we

476
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,850
don't want to monetize this is just an

477
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,980
experiment okay which is feeding other

478
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,199
experiments which is you know and then

479
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,730
eventually we have a new product or now

480
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,820
who knows so the idea here is to it's

481
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:21,330
not to present a tool it's not a it's

482
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,669
far it's really I would say it's it's

483
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:27,629
kind of a prototype but it shows how

484
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:31,920
with little effort and let's say without

485
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:35,130
a lot of let's say B being a you know

486
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,320
some sort of AI expert you can still do

487
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,300
some stuff because the B technology all

488
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,950
these frameworks are actually have

489
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,490
improved in terms of usability and

490
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:46,560
they're abstracting a lot right so what

491
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,630
I'm proposing it you know many people

492
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,000
think here well AI like you know that's

493
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,000
too much or it's like a new I don't know

494
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,380
I have to do a PhD no no you can you can

495
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,360
do stuff it's not gonna be perfect

496
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,700
whatever but at least you can you can

497
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,840
start doing something and the effort is

498
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:05,850
not in the actual implementation of the

499
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,659
solution the AI solution and when I say

500
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:11,580
I you know it looks a little bit like

501
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,200
you know I would like to demystify that

502
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,120
but it's pretty much statistics okay

503
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,280
it's hard core and there are many things

504
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,830
going on which you know you don't have

505
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,090
to be aware of everything to do stuff

506
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:26,370
but you know there there's this product

507
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,959
I'm gonna talk about called Kara's does

508
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,179
anyone know care as Google's care you

509
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,920
don't care us okay so I think here us is

510
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,560
pretty interesting because before care s

511
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,490
you have to you have to work with

512
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:41,460
specific tip learning stack so like

513
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,350
tensorflow which you know if you look at

514
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,130
the other code is is much more involved

515
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,639
if you want to

516
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,200
you implement your AI classifier now

517
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,810
we're gonna talk a little bit more about

518
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,090
that you have to do some heavy lifting

519
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,850
and now which carries it's pretty much

520
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,429
more like plug you know try and play you

521
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,439
just you build think about like a sort

522
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,930
of information flow and what do you want

523
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,250
to happen in you know in every single

524
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,870
phase and under a lot of variations a

525
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,790
lot of different topologies you know you

526
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,270
can you can invest if you want a decade

527
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:18,399
in that but it's much easier so and it's

528
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,050
accessible it's not gonna be perfect but

529
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,950
at least you're gonna get somewhere

530
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:25,840
probably so the real challenge here the

531
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,180
challenges so when I started with this

532
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,500
okay what what is the what is the first

533
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,110
channel you know people tell you about

534
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,480
okay Google's is open sourcing cameras

535
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:38,110
tensorflow whatever all these fantastic

536
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,940
toolkits the great promise the data if

537
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:43,179
you don't have the data it's totally

538
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:46,740
useless so the data is what really

539
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,550
drives your the quality of your

540
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,020
prediction you know and we're gonna

541
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,470
we're gonna see what kind of prediction

542
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,510
we're gonna make so that that was the

543
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,980
main challenge so I didn't have any data

544
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,190
I'm not Google I mean I don't have

545
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:03,430
access to something to train tomorrow so

546
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,800
in AI let me go rewind a little bit just

547
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:08,410
just to I'm gonna try to explain but you

548
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,710
typically works in this way as a

549
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,970
security guys we're used to when when

550
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,190
you want to protect something or

551
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,980
whatever to build rules right we start

552
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,960
saying well if this user is coming from

553
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,820
this IP address you know you build these

554
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,690
access control rules what about it's

555
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,580
very rule-based

556
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,440
based on the knowledge we have about

557
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,639
about security about you know her

558
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:34,060
abilities and and kind of you know

559
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,880
reducing the attack surface right but in

560
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:39,159
machine learning works different so you

561
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,820
know you know you create the rules you

562
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:47,530
just you know feed the let's say the the

563
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:49,840
engine with data so with data and then

564
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,399
you have to say you have to label the

565
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,490
data you have to tell the system like

566
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,440
okay this is something an insecure flow

567
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,850
and this is secure this is whatever you

568
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,049
have to classify it somehow

569
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,570
it's called labeling

570
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:03,730
okay and when you provide that you you

571
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,590
you kind of the output of that is some

572
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,440
sort of let's call it brain which has

573
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,080
all you know it kind of create a lot of

574
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,929
inferences of based on that data so

575
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,879
somehow all the rules that you didn't

576
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,070
build manually are encapsulated pretty

577
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:20,168
much they're based on observations of

578
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:23,678
the data that the system made about the

579
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:25,360
data okay so the with in machine

580
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,029
learning you have like the let's say the

581
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,219
shallow learning and the deep learning

582
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:32,769
and the main difference to me is that

583
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:39,159
the shallow learning you have to tell

584
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:40,960
the AI engine what do you care about so

585
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:43,389
for instance if you're analyzing a flow

586
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,090
you know you care about maybe whether

587
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:48,039
that's an encrypted flow or not right or

588
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,189
you care about you know whether using

589
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:53,769
HTTP or they're using there is some some

590
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,989
sort of patterns in the URL you know so

591
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:58,590
you you have to implement all that it's

592
00:25:55,989 --> 00:26:01,960
called feature extraction so you have to

593
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:04,149
you know say okay these this flow it's

594
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,730
actually insecure or it's not HTTP not

595
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:08,820
insecure it's this flow it has a URL

596
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,679
with some parameter which is let's say

597
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,450
it looks like flag or something like

598
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,720
that so you you kind of you have to

599
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:18,399
build that so and then it learns you

600
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,009
feed you know the system with the data

601
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:22,719
and you'll get you know the model but

602
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:24,789
you still have to implement this feature

603
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,830
extraction you know process which

604
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:29,049
requires know-how of course because you

605
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,539
have to know which what is relevant what

606
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:33,850
is not if you just pick up something

607
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:35,350
that is not relevant you know then the

608
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,908
prediction quality will be very low

609
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,629
because it's not going to look at the

610
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:41,889
really important things right so and

611
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:45,369
deep learning is very interesting

612
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:48,488
because it will it will it doesn't need

613
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:51,009
to do that so so you're gonna you're

614
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:52,690
gonna provide the data and the feature

615
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,789
extraction it's gonna be lets say

616
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,129
automatic okay so it's gonna it's gonna

617
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:59,799
learn all this feature by itself now

618
00:26:57,129 --> 00:27:02,379
what's the challenge is the amount of

619
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,869
examples so in order to learn all the

620
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:08,320
different permutations variational that

621
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:10,418
you have to feed you know the the

622
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,480
learning process with a lot of data and

623
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:15,899
not only a lot of data a lot of

624
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,330
diverse data so so a lot of I don't know

625
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:20,399
let's say in HTTP data flow but then

626
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,289
maybe you have a restful api data flow

627
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,289
maybe you have you know just to play an

628
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:27,570
old JSON file so you have to it's called

629
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:29,820
kind of generalizing you have to try to

630
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,220
feed it with good data because if if the

631
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,600
you know if the data is not good you

632
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,970
know you're gonna you're gonna get a

633
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,830
really bad prediction so the other thing

634
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,779
is that even if you use to be learning

635
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,759
it's still supervised learning what you

636
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:48,119
say that doesn't mean it means that you

637
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:53,309
still have to tell you know that that

638
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:57,389
specific piece of let's say data is

639
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:58,710
actually whatever something we have to

640
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:02,519
label it you want to say that that's

641
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:05,159
unsecure but that's secure okay so you

642
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,570
want you you have to do that because if

643
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,080
not the system will not be able to

644
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,639
classify okay so I mean there is also

645
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,918
supervised learning but but that's

646
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:16,320
that's it's used for pretty much

647
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,690
analyzing and kind of clustering and and

648
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,239
it's it's it's not gonna give you you

649
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,889
know label as an output you want to know

650
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:24,869
whether that traffic is secure or not so

651
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:26,428
you have to tell the system you know all

652
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:30,738
this example what they mean pretty much

653
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,739
ok this Security's unsecure so

654
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:39,539
consumption ready well of course it's

655
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:40,830
bits PII is is is a confidential

656
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,450
information as personal data right

657
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,889
personal there is not gonna be out there

658
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:48,539
just you know clear text and then as

659
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:49,709
mentioned before you know we also we're

660
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:53,009
always try to learn from existing

661
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:55,200
implementations and and there's so

662
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:57,359
little that you kind of have to start

663
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,159
from pretty much from scratch you have

664
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,769
all these pretty good frameworks but

665
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:07,259
still you need to you have to start from

666
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:14,059
scratch it's a little bit let me see if

667
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:15,749
I can I'm not sure I can sue my outfit

668
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,999
are you able to see it

669
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:19,999
well it's a little bit small

670
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:25,309
so this is how it worked but I have

671
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:31,619
another diagram I'm kind of splitting

672
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:33,330
okay this is looks looks better so first

673
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:35,158
of all we don't have the data so what

674
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:38,100
are we gonna do if we don't have the

675
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:42,659
data we are going to generate let's call

676
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,488
it our own data okay so and that's

677
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,529
pretty dangerous because see if you

678
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:48,929
generate your own data it's that data

679
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:50,460
problem is gonna be biased or you know

680
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:53,489
it's gonna be just what you think about

681
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:56,909
traffic for instance information flows

682
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:59,279
but you know the reality is that you

683
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:02,159
know might be totally different so how

684
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:06,539
can you create an artificial what's

685
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:09,600
called a synthetic data set that is

686
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:13,859
based or kind of can be applied to

687
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,449
real-world situations so and and this

688
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:17,279
once again this is just an example you

689
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,049
can you can spend a lot of time just

690
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:23,639
dealing with this province called data

691
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:26,279
programming so you can you can just you

692
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:28,529
know spend a lot of time just you know

693
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,600
improving this but with a very simple

694
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:32,399
model and I'm gonna explain how it work

695
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,619
it's actually generally pretty good I

696
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:40,289
think data okay so how does it work what

697
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:42,809
I pretty much did you know open API it's

698
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:47,658
it's you know it's pretty much a

699
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:50,549
descriptor of restful api so it's a

700
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:53,700
suspect it's like the old I'm not sure

701
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,399
how many people know they whistle you

702
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,619
know old stuff that you know younger

703
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,719
people don't know about but it keeps

704
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:05,100
being reinvented okay bad so it's a kind

705
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:08,460
of whistle for restful api so WSDL

706
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,350
that's that's how it's about so what

707
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:16,109
what we're doing is pretty much the

708
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:18,418
following we I had access to all the all

709
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:20,340
these descriptors its public okay and

710
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,019
these are pre good quality so this

711
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,470
capital it's pretty much like a spec

712
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:28,139
that you know what a RESTful API is

713
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,999
actually expecting so you build some

714
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:32,158
sort of message that conforms to that

715
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:32,790
and then you know what pretty much what

716
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,500
you're gonna get

717
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,480
as response so it's a way to structure

718
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,090
the communication okay when you're

719
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,850
connecting for instance with Amazon with

720
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:43,709
Google YouTube through restful api is

721
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,480
you wanna you want to know what you're

722
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,800
gonna get back so you can process it

723
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,840
okay and and the other uses scenario is

724
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,340
that if you have that descriptor there

725
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,129
are a lot of products that can create

726
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:58,860
the actual client you know the actual

727
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,350
stub that will you know connect you to

728
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,209
Amazon without having to implement

729
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:05,040
anything you just here's you just

730
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,260
provide this pack and you get the code

731
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,010
back and you just start using that that

732
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,190
that's pretty cool

733
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:13,800
okay that's that's also was pretty

734
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,060
common and back in my day from whistle

735
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,040
you could generate the steps and a

736
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:20,070
skeleton well you could also generate

737
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:24,930
the server side of it okay so it's a so

738
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:26,879
what I pretty much then is so III I got

739
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:30,510
into the the descriptors and then I

740
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,700
tapped into one of these toolkits these

741
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:35,670
toolkits are meant to send data right

742
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,620
and to receive data and you know if

743
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,510
they're not meant to generate data set

744
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,270
so what I pretty much did it I just

745
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,220
tapped into it so instead of sending

746
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,950
anything through out the wire I just

747
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,590
captured that I say okay give me the

748
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:52,770
spec and I'm gonna take this back I'm

749
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:55,169
gonna gonna generate my own message so

750
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:58,080
I'm not gonna send anything so by the

751
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,460
cool thing is that I you know we it

752
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,350
could reuse somehow all the

753
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,570
infrastructure but at some point I just

754
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:06,000
took over I said well now leave me the

755
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,830
spec so I can you know I can digest it I

756
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,480
can do whatever I want you know and the

757
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,830
toolkit was fine when a Python you can

758
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,160
pretty much hack anything with hi

759
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:17,070
chocolate so so so that's what we're

760
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:21,690
doing so we have a like I think there

761
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:25,110
are like a few thousands of api's and

762
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:28,830
and I'm pretty much yeah we get the spec

763
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:31,879
and we can and we can generate those

764
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:34,110
fake requests the smart requests okay

765
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,760
how do we generate the smoke requests

766
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:38,520
well it's interesting since we took over

767
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:43,500
that process we can leverage a lot of

768
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:46,370
Python has a really good random data

769
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,230
generator so that are used for something

770
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,449
different so what what we pretty much

771
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,630
have is it's like a sort of schema where

772
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,370
you say well you know this is a social

773
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,610
security number and and you have the

774
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:00,590
corresponding let's say generator for

775
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,590
that so so it's not just generating

776
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:06,949
strings or whatever it's also checked

777
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,810
it's also generating a social signal

778
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,780
numbers phone numbers real you know

779
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:15,830
looking so and this this life is called

780
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:20,120
faker if anyone wants to try second

781
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:22,639
thing we you know there are some fields

782
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,730
with we got regular expressions you know

783
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,440
regular expression I used to to match

784
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:30,800
you know pretty much text we use that

785
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,929
insecurities a lot right so what we

786
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,990
wanted to do is kind of instead of using

787
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,700
a regular expression to match tags we

788
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,009
want to actually to generate text from

789
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:42,799
regular expressions okay because rival

790
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:45,139
expression is is really its aspect also

791
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,370
but of the specific fields so you got a

792
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,200
regular expression with social security

793
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,388
numbers so what we wanted to do is

794
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:52,428
actually go the opposite way so we had

795
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:56,330
wrong expressions and we generate the

796
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:58,430
fake instances of valid text based on

797
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,380
that regular expression so we work at

798
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,990
the let's say at the request level and

799
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,030
then at the field level so that was that

800
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:08,330
was pretty interesting and Python I mean

801
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:12,740
I'm not a you know I I am a pretty

802
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:14,900
little bit you know I love programming

803
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,879
languages we we develop rhyming

804
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,300
languages and domain-specific languages

805
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,190
python is really it's really very you

806
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,410
know hands on and you have so much out

807
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,210
there so that's why you know we use pie

808
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,710
dough if it's not my maybe favorite part

809
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,950
language but it's very hands-on there's

810
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:33,410
so many the community it's great and you

811
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:35,990
can find anything which is which is

812
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:38,779
doesn't happen with other languages so

813
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:42,950
so this is pretty much how it works okay

814
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:46,070
and the other problem that we have okay

815
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:49,939
once we have okay we generated the this

816
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:52,850
fake message okay you seem fake fields

817
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,980
that look pretty real okay now we have

818
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,990
to tell the system what is this right

819
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,630
because it's not enough just to generate

820
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,140
the message so in order to do that we

821
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,120
have to

822
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,210
automatically you know we didn't want to

823
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,160
send that data set to you know there's

824
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,650
an Amazon service that they can lay

825
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,690
label data sets right we didn't want to

826
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:15,530
go through that we it's it's expensive

827
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:17,540
next time it requires some expertise so

828
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,340
we we we did some automatic labeling

829
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,670
which is pretty simple approach I would

830
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,380
say you know maybe too simple but it's

831
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,370
just the tip of the iceberg then you can

832
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,090
you can do something much more

833
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:31,390
sophisticated we just detect some

834
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:34,400
trigger words okay so okay you have a

835
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,140
SSN and some you know something a

836
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,630
certain looking in the name of the field

837
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:41,390
or you have this field or something so

838
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:44,630
we kind of find for hints that that

839
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:47,750
message could be confidential it's it's

840
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,700
really simple what it does but even with

841
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,310
something so simple it's it doesn't work

842
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,529
that bad okay if you want to explore all

843
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,850
this area there's it's called data

844
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,710
Primus mentioned before there's a

845
00:36:55,850 --> 00:37:00,350
there's a whole toolkit that does that

846
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:02,150
it's called snorkel and they use machine

847
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,700
learning to do the labeling it's pretty

848
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,830
cool okay so but I didn't want to get

849
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,960
into that so because it's it's it's

850
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,340
never any story but at least you know if

851
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,590
you wanted to do that you know right now

852
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,390
we just look for some very basic hints

853
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:16,910
like pattern matching like SS I know

854
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:20,029
stuff like that in the creation file but

855
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:22,310
if you use a machine learning model you

856
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:24,710
could actually do some natural language

857
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:27,049
processing and fine you know be smarter

858
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,520
in terms okay it's this SSL but then you

859
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,680
know it doesn't look like there's

860
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,750
anything else that's confidential so

861
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,390
maybe I'll flag it I'd say no it's not i

862
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:39,530
discard I just consider it like maybe

863
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:41,120
not confidential but it's it's difficult

864
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:44,120
you would need to build a separate model

865
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,009
just to label data sets so as you can

866
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:50,000
see it's a huge for this is just you

867
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:54,080
know the tip of the iceberg other

868
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,930
problem I had API is typically don't

869
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,420
send PII over the wire so you don't get

870
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:01,399
you know if you if you want to submit a

871
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,080
request to Amazon you you won't probably

872
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,930
submit a social security number it

873
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,660
probably so made an ID or something and

874
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,609
they will you know link that ID to your

875
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,529
to some confidential information but

876
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,030
that's not gonna pretty much go

877
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:17,480
throughout the wire

878
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:20,030
typically so this is a different problem

879
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,970
so you have to you know I had very

880
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,740
little positive examples so like when I

881
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:27,350
say positive is like if you know it has

882
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,109
confidential data so in order to address

883
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:33,759
that I use a very simple technique I

884
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:38,090
based on on say on an example

885
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,590
confidential request we can create

886
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,030
others because we know that's

887
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,730
confidential okay let's create maybe

888
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:45,140
twenty more okay so because you have to

889
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,870
get to a point where you have what is

890
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:50,600
called a balanced data set like 5050 you

891
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:52,790
have you know has BIA it doesn't have

892
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:56,750
PII it doesn't need to be 5050 but if

893
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:58,490
you have 1090 it's it's it's very

894
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,920
ineffective it doesn't work so you have

895
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:03,740
to pretty much teach the system you know

896
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,900
in a you know with with giving providing

897
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,060
a sort of as much before a balanced data

898
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,480
set so this was the technique once again

899
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:13,730
if you want to if you want to do this in

900
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,700
a more sophisticated fashion you have

901
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:20,840
you can also use machinery for that you

902
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:22,910
can use a supervised in a supervised

903
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,680
machine learning to do that and it's

904
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,470
called principal component analysis you

905
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,029
can you can also you know there are many

906
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,160
ways to do that which are much better

907
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,710
than the one I use but you know this is

908
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,210
just once again an experiment but this

909
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,210
is a whole different area if you want to

910
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:44,360
so this is what what I was you know I I

911
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:49,120
wanted to also describe you know the

912
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:52,190
flow so it's a stays in the presentation

913
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:55,910
it's pretty much what I said let me see

914
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:58,700
if there is anything well the trigger

915
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:00,020
words I said before yeah

916
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,230
and the over sampling of the minority

917
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:06,650
class which is which is all these flows

918
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:11,380
that have PII within it so so that's

919
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:11,380
pretty much the the data set generation

920
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,690
once we have the data set right we have

921
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,890
these data set here we can we can we

922
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:23,420
have to build some sort of a cavalry

923
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:27,560
okay because the the AI or the deep

924
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,480
learning machinery doesn't doesn't know

925
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,070
about

926
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,110
text doesn't doesn't know about you know

927
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:37,210
it's it cannot deal with that has to

928
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:38,570
deal with with something that is has a

929
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,640
it's called

930
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,830
vectorize which is pretty much I think

931
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,350
about like a sort of vocabulary where

932
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:47,990
you have a you know a letter and you

933
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:50,450
have a sort of ID okay so you have to

934
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,879
you have to associate a specific less a

935
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,649
character with some with some sort of ID

936
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,950
okay and there are many ways to do that

937
00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:00,950
I've used a very simple way to do that

938
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,810
but I had to build this vocabulary which

939
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:05,359
is pretty simple and then once I have

940
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,980
the vocabulary I can just create this

941
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,710
vector think about a vector just as a

942
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:11,920
stream of numbers okay that if you want

943
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:15,560
to put it simple so that's what the

944
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,330
actually what the AI in learning process

945
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,730
is digesting doesn't know anything about

946
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,670
restful doesn't know anything about you

947
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,830
know it's just sequence of of numbers

948
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,990
and and it's gonna try to make sense out

949
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:31,370
of that right with associated with the

950
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:33,560
label so I here where I use carrots with

951
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:35,509
Tessa flow the good part of carrots is

952
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,360
that you can actually you can actually

953
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,400
choose a different dip learning engine

954
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,560
so if you want to go with the Microsoft

955
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,180
one you can do it without changing your

956
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,240
code it's not really like that but

957
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:50,149
pretty much so it provides some sort of

958
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,490
Vendrell you know kind of yeah remove

959
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,350
the coupling with with a specific AI

960
00:41:52,490 --> 00:42:00,080
engine

961
00:41:53,350 --> 00:42:01,970
I hear there's something lsdm so there's

962
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,460
there have been a lot of advances in AI

963
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:06,709
and as you can see from from the press

964
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,470
it's typically used to to kind of

965
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:12,740
analyze pictures right it's used a lot

966
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,450
for that and and this is like the main

967
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:18,680
application at least the one I'm seeing

968
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:20,689
but the same technology can be can be

969
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,940
used also to analyze text and when I say

970
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:27,080
analysts acts you know you can you can

971
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,770
you can use it to in some way to to work

972
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:35,960
with language to English work with

973
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:37,790
restful message as JSON XML okay so it

974
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,790
doesn't you know it doesn't need to be

975
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:42,150
and structure because typically when you

976
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,038
see AI you

977
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:47,039
you know a lot of implementation of AI

978
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,930
in the natural language processing are

979
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,029
actually for natural language you want

980
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,788
the machine to understand English right

981
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:56,279
and here which is in structure but I I

982
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:58,410
wanted something that is actually semi

983
00:42:56,279 --> 00:43:00,690
structure which is Jason so I have an

984
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,328
advantage there because you know the

985
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,400
grammar somehow first of all there's

986
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:08,069
this you know fix-it syntax

987
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:14,009
Jason you know has some specific rules

988
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:16,049
right syntax rules and then every API

989
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:18,359
would have you know some similarities so

990
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:20,519
it's not like you know reading

991
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:22,650
Shakespeare or and then you know reading

992
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,680
I don't know in your times you know it's

993
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:28,799
a it's much easier to find patterns so I

994
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,308
what I pretty much did is just consider

995
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:35,249
the the structure same a semi structured

996
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:38,430
representation as just you know just

997
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:40,200
text English it doesn't really know but

998
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:42,509
using you know natural processing

999
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,970
natural processing capability in natural

1000
00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:48,720
language processing capabilities of lsdm

1001
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:52,589
ylst M is is is cool so when you see L

1002
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,640
STM is actually deep neural network

1003
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:56,519
there are a lot of it's called

1004
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:59,690
topologies many different shapes so

1005
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:03,529
every every every topology has its own

1006
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:05,640
strengths and weaknesses okay so

1007
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:07,710
honestly it's very difficult to know

1008
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,160
whether which one will work so there's a

1009
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:12,599
lot of empirical testing G so you pretty

1010
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,249
much say okay let's see how it work with

1011
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,230
lsdm okay then let's see how we work

1012
00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:17,669
with this so even researchers do that

1013
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,220
it's very difficult to know whether

1014
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:23,640
which you know machine learning

1015
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,779
algorithm or you know will specifically

1016
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,589
work for your a combination will work

1017
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:31,230
for you so I pretty much started with

1018
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:33,989
the elastic mmm it looked like the the

1019
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:36,930
most let's say advanced and the main

1020
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:39,660
thing is that lsdm the main is that I

1021
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:41,460
would say it's stateful this is the key

1022
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,348
the key thing you know when when you're

1023
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,759
processing let's say JSON JSON file

1024
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:45,299
right you want to know what happened

1025
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:47,430
before

1026
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:52,619
pretty much right because you wanna even

1027
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:54,419
have context okay so even if neural

1028
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:55,890
network actually has memory of course

1029
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,450
you know there there's

1030
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:59,910
you know it's actually the new run is

1031
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,680
actually you know being this you know

1032
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:05,399
updated so there is there is state but

1033
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,690
lsdm is kind of along all these let's

1034
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,259
say de planning there's this a whole

1035
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:13,380
it's a flow of information okay

1036
00:45:10,259 --> 00:45:21,359
that goes back and forth you can inject

1037
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:23,249
pieces like sort of cookies of data that

1038
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:26,609
that is related with what happened

1039
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:28,230
before and in my case it was interesting

1040
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:32,069
because I wanted to know you know I want

1041
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:34,759
it I want to be the the the kind of the

1042
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:38,400
machine learning model 12-cylinder how

1043
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:41,400
you know these API requests look like so

1044
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,890
for that to happen I wanted to kind of

1045
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,450
you know consider whatever happened

1046
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,680
before so if you're looking at the

1047
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,960
social security number you want to know

1048
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:53,460
that that's part of maybe an object

1049
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,960
jason object which is a other personal

1050
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,299
details and you want to know that that's

1051
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,460
inside a customer and then you want to

1052
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:01,019
know that that's inside whatever object

1053
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,489
because that's it's going to also

1054
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:04,680
provide some hints in terms of whether

1055
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:08,609
that's also it kind of looks like

1056
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:11,160
invalid JS or at least the j so that you

1057
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:13,049
used you know to train the system so

1058
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,239
it's a way to do some sort of I would

1059
00:46:13,049 --> 00:46:17,609
say the fuzzy parser you know typically

1060
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,440
you have to part JSON well this is it

1061
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:21,299
doesn't really Partridge them but at the

1062
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,880
same time you're getting whether that

1063
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:25,950
JSON it's it looks like you know you

1064
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,059
know JSON you're interested in not valid

1065
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:32,730
okay so lsdm it's it's memory pretty

1066
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:34,739
much if it remembers what happens before

1067
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:37,230
so you can inject that into the learning

1068
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:38,880
cycle so you can you get better output

1069
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:44,130
and then and then you have the analytics

1070
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:50,789
model okay and this what I explained

1071
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:54,480
okay pretty much okay but from beddings

1072
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:56,660
is the same as vectorizing is the same

1073
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,660
thing

1074
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:08,640
and this is a prediction face it it's

1075
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,110
frizzy actually once you have the model

1076
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:16,290
you have to test the system against

1077
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:18,670
unseen traffic and see in request right

1078
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:21,370
so what would you typically do you know

1079
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,380
you need you need you know some sort of

1080
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:27,750
real-world example and then you just

1081
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:30,010
push that into the into the system and

1082
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:33,160
before you do that you have to vectorize

1083
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:36,010
it so vector I see you know because this

1084
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,200
is the representation that that you used

1085
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:41,470
for training so everything has to follow

1086
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,390
the same same representation you cannot

1087
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,279
just inject text here even if it will

1088
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,430
not work so you have to be careful with

1089
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,710
that so the same let's say vectorization

1090
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:52,480
process you use with vocabulary well

1091
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,280
that has to be applied at prediction

1092
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,800
time with the sample you want to you

1093
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,630
want to predict all okay so so this is

1094
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,000
the same has to be the same process

1095
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:03,430
because if you if you mess it up here

1096
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,110
it's it's not gonna work okay so and

1097
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,330
cameras and tensorflow well at the same

1098
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:09,760
thing you're just gonna gonna load the

1099
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:12,279
model and you're gonna you're gonna get

1100
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,400
you know whether that has some PII or

1101
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:20,590
not and this is what I am explaining

1102
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:23,200
pretty much so the prediction part is is

1103
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:27,000
pretty simple what is what is Chanin is

1104
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:31,629
get to a good model and it you know it's

1105
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:34,980
far from perfect I've I've tested you

1106
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:38,890
know with the with some real-world

1107
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:40,510
messages that works pretty well but with

1108
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,000
a very basic configuration I think they

1109
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:45,010
the key thing with the with the solution

1110
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,020
is how you configure it how you make it

1111
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:50,740
more advanced so that you can generate

1112
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:52,690
better data okay and and what I'm really

1113
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,729
doing is generated a baseline data set

1114
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:58,210
and then the idea is that you have to

1115
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:59,800
feed that with we your own flows okay so

1116
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,990
that it can actually learn how your

1117
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,120
traffic looks like but at least you

1118
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,430
start with something okay and then you

1119
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,170
can improve it you can you can make them

1120
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:10,149
all you can actually updated model so

1121
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,420
this is just the creation of a baseline

1122
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:17,830
okay with a very simple

1123
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:19,180
configuration so right now let's see if

1124
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:24,430
this will work because it's actually

1125
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:32,770
remote so I've taken a lot of risk here

1126
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:34,779
so let's see if I get I can go back so

1127
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:38,200
one thing about the deployment of this

1128
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,850
kind of stuff the the learning and

1129
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,129
that's why I'm remote actually but I

1130
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:47,830
like the learning the learning process

1131
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:52,090
is actually requires a lot of CPU power

1132
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:54,430
ok and traditional CPUs are not really

1133
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:56,380
good for for deep learning so that's why

1134
00:49:54,430 --> 00:50:00,460
you have to use for instance Nvidia

1135
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:05,640
video it's like these are like native

1136
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:08,800
CPUs that are designed to to you know to

1137
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:12,819
to work with vectors for itself to work

1138
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:16,570
with this kind of system yet you wanna

1139
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:19,840
try to go fast so right now this is a

1140
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:25,420
box in jig now okay it's it's box with

1141
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:27,520
the Nvidia card I think it's a P 100 ok

1142
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,350
add for prediction I don't really need a

1143
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,850
lot of computer power but the problem is

1144
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:33,640
that the system has been trained there

1145
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:34,990
so when you train this the model in in

1146
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,660
this kind of box it doesn't work in my

1147
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:42,450
Mac so I need to write the prediction

1148
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:42,450
here so let's let's do the following

1149
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:55,080
so I have here a several like example

1150
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:57,640
messages ok example requests printers

1151
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,500
this kind of looks like has some

1152
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,910
personal data right something that could

1153
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:06,310
be considered confidential are you able

1154
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:08,859
to see the interesting thing is that I

1155
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,670
never trained the system with I don't

1156
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,800
think so at least

1157
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:16,090
and with the information from YouTube or

1158
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:18,160
or the Magento schema okay so it's it

1159
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,660
doesn't it's this should be like in

1160
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,240
scene example it doesn't know anything

1161
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:24,279
about slack okay so you want to try with

1162
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,359
stuff that is really different from what

1163
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,780
you learn

1164
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:31,210
- do you know - to run the system with

1165
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:35,320
before so what I'm doing here is just

1166
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:43,530
run this shop grip which is gonna invoke

1167
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:43,530
the prediction okay as if it works

1168
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,439
like a lot of learning model and

1169
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,330
generate a prediction that's it okay of

1170
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,040
course these are very few messages but

1171
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:58,569
but the performance of prediction is

1172
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,100
really really good the learning is very

1173
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:04,660
slow but the prediction is extremely

1174
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:09,580
fast and what it does it generates CSV

1175
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:12,040
file ok and you can see that this is

1176
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:14,860
really if we sensitive it's actually

1177
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:17,710
it's it's one if it's not sensitive it's

1178
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,210
zero okay so this is this is the I would

1179
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:22,060
say the important thing and the other

1180
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:26,040
thing is the probability of that output

1181
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:30,250
to be let's say to be correct okay to be

1182
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:32,350
to be you know true so with slack for

1183
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,570
instance let's see slack it says that

1184
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:36,730
that it's not confidential let's have a

1185
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:42,760
look at slack okay we can have a look at

1186
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:46,900
predict slide you can see doesn't look

1187
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:51,400
confidential right completely starts

1188
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:53,800
complete whatever but then if you go

1189
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:58,720
let's say you - okay that's also an

1190
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:59,520
example YouTube message it doesn't look

1191
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,080
confidential

1192
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,200
okay this there's nothing that looks

1193
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:10,230
confidential at least at first sight but

1194
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:13,870
then it's seen the coppa this one Jason

1195
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:16,960
it's confidential and there is 93% of

1196
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:23,560
probability lies confidential so so

1197
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:25,450
let's have a look at it actually there

1198
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,600
is a lot of information here there is an

1199
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:35,649
email there are some hints here

1200
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:38,380
authentication credentials names user

1201
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:39,490
names first name last name so this looks

1202
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,740
confidential and

1203
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:45,189
saying that it is confident once again

1204
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:49,000
this model is strength it's with really

1205
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:50,980
really basic configuration I'm going to

1206
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,610
show you that if I have you know one

1207
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,530
more minute

1208
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,900
so this one is Saints confidential so

1209
00:53:53,530 --> 00:54:00,250
you can see here Coppa confidential it's

1210
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:04,210
a one see here this is one okay 93% then

1211
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:05,619
we have Magento but see it's a that's

1212
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,920
confidential but it's not so

1213
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:10,060
confidential

1214
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,820
well there is an email there's a first

1215
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:14,950
name and a last name it is but if you

1216
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:18,850
look at the previous magic method has it

1217
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:21,220
has much more PII see it's a bigger

1218
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:22,390
message so in this case it's saying it's

1219
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:25,060
confidential but the other one is

1220
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:26,710
considered like more you know more

1221
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:29,470
confidential because there's more data

1222
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:33,070
exposed okay more personal data explore

1223
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:34,569
more bi expose let's see at the last one

1224
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:37,600
it's saying that a class scene is very

1225
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:39,400
confidential okay it's 96% of chances

1226
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,040
that it's comfy you know how probability

1227
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:47,380
so we can see that and we can we can

1228
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:49,359
have a look at last year well there's

1229
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,130
something here which is password he

1230
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,180
doesn't like you know it looks like you

1231
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,920
know password is something you don't

1232
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:57,930
wanna you want to communicate over the

1233
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:00,850
wire so there's also an IP address so

1234
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:04,149
pretty much it works I actually found a

1235
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:07,270
lot of corner cases but but it's not

1236
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:09,640
it's not because of the of the actual AI

1237
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:13,500
it's because of the data and you wanna

1238
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:16,000
you want to see the just to finish this

1239
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:21,850
let me let me show you the configuration

1240
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:24,900
file if you know these are kind of all

1241
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:28,359
these knowledge about all the different

1242
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:31,109
fields that are Cassiopeia is right and

1243
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:34,330
under format and as you can see it's

1244
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:36,220
it's not very extensive it's it's not

1245
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:39,340
even considering a lot of different

1246
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:40,930
permutations or stuff like that so it's

1247
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:44,109
a very you can see it's it's a couple of

1248
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:45,819
pages of code nothing and so this this

1249
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:47,619
actually has to be improve and adapted

1250
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,570
you know you have to you know do it much

1251
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:51,190
better than than what I what I did here

1252
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:53,140
but even with this very basic

1253
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:56,769
configuration it's giving pretty

1254
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,759
an output okay and if you look at the

1255
00:55:56,769 --> 00:56:03,459
code it's open source

1256
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:09,839
okay so you can you can pretty much go

1257
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:12,519
here and let's see sorry sir

1258
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:20,049
well it's not it's not I don't know why

1259
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:23,379
it's showing yeah yeah so that that's

1260
00:56:20,049 --> 00:56:25,420
that's opposed hi I made about about

1261
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,579
it's a kind of tutorial it's not a

1262
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:30,250
tutorial Ike the story of you know of

1263
00:56:27,579 --> 00:56:32,440
the privity how we started you know on

1264
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:34,359
how it works and then that's that's the

1265
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,950
open source project so there's there's a

1266
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:39,700
lot a lot to do so we're always looking

1267
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:42,069
for contributors so people I want to you

1268
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,629
know move this forward and you're gonna

1269
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:45,700
check the code and you'll see that I

1270
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:47,549
mean I believe in that if you really

1271
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,558
want to do it you can I mean pretty much

1272
00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:52,359
anyone can can work on it I'd improve it

1273
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,279
and it's love also about how you

1274
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:56,440
customize it you don't necessarily need

1275
00:56:54,279 --> 00:56:57,940
to to work in the code you can just

1276
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,650
configure it better you can generate

1277
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,829
better data and that's not related with

1278
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:06,130
with the AI unless you go with with a

1279
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:11,099
you know machinery approach so that's it

1280
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:11,099
okay thank you

1281
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,930
you
