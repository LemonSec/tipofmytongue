2
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,849
thank you everyone

3
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,579
all right so as you mentioned I'm gonna

4
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,979
be talking about how to assess the

5
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,930
maturity of your security program in

6
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,460
your organization let me tell you a

7
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,869
little bit about myself and where I'm

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,629
coming from so you kind of know my

9
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:55,199
perspective on this I was a developer

10
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,930
early in my career I also worked as a

11
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,780
computer virus analyst at Trend Micro

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,789
for a little while I've been a technical

13
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,850
project manager on a lot of application

14
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,130
development efforts and most recently

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,490
over the last five years or so I've been

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,408
focusing on application security and in

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,110
particular doing governance over our

18
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,520
application security team what that

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,299
means for me is I've been doing things

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,149
like leading efforts to roll out some of

21
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,530
the top ten best practices to our

22
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:27,179
developers and trying to help them

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,369
figure out how to you know integrate

24
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:32,149
that into their coding practices how to

25
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,190
do better secure code reviews how to

26
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:38,489
integrate security into the left of our

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,800
process so that when releases are

28
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,090
planned they're integrating security

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,700
bringing them in earlier and earlier

30
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,869
that kind of thing and so one of the

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,000
things I've been doing over the last

32
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,250
year is looking at our application

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,860
security initiative and doing an

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,209
assessment of the maturity so I want to

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,800
share you with you some of the lessons

36
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,090
we've had about as we've approached this

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,830
over the last year have to trying to

38
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,050
figure out how to assess how mature our

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,360
security application security program is

40
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,300
and kind of the path we took and some of

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,920
the lessons we learned there all right

42
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,859
so first of all I think one of the most

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,510
important things is to know why you're

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,849
trying to assess maturity in your

45
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,530
security initiative so there's lots of

46
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,359
good reasons you might be getting into

47
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,989
this it might be saying how mature is

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,400
our application security program here

49
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:24,750
one of the one reason might just be

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,849
you're trying to figure out where to

51
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,560
spend your your budget dollars and

52
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,840
security in the next year and you want

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,720
to know as you grow what's a good area

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,909
beneficial area to grow into you might

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,709
also be asking yourself like what kind

56
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,170
of gaps do we have you may not know

57
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,480
really or you might have some good ideas

58
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,369
about where your gaps are and just want

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,079
to confirm your gut

60
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,780
about which areas you need to guys need

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,310
to be investing in another thing and I

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,349
think one that this is probably a big

63
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,620
driver for us is that we have some ideas

64
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:58,379
about what that we need to grow and it's

65
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,989
about making the case to our senior VP -

66
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,399
Orsi so that you know it's not just us

67
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,409
saying this that this is kind of an

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,190
industry industry best practice and this

69
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:09,720
really is what other companies are doing

70
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,069
and then you might want to you might

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,049
know you're gonna be investing in your

72
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,640
initiative and just want to have some

73
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,190
hard data to show that you've actually

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,569
improved so take a benchmark now later

75
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,599
on you can show that you've improved

76
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:23,548
over time and then you know another

77
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
option another way this might be helpful

78
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,870
for you is if you have a vendor or

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,309
outside supplier you want to figure out

80
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,049
how mature they are they're telling you

81
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,180
they have a really secure initiative and

82
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,890
you want to figure out if that's true so

83
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,150
those are all the good reasons there are

84
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,069
some bad reasons to be assessing your

85
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,590
security initiative one is that you've

86
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:45,780
just been told by them and that might be

87
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,060
an outside consultant came in and said

88
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,669
hey go assess your maturity it might be

89
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,230
one of those VPS I want to do this

90
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,180
because they know this is a thing people

91
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,230
do but they're not gonna do anything

92
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,609
with the results no point wasting money

93
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,888
another reason that's not a great reason

94
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,269
to do this is because you are just

95
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:04,889
useful to get an answer and just do

96
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,169
whatever it says you're not gonna

97
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,700
evaluate the results or figure out if

98
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,590
it's gonna fit into your organization

99
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,030
you're just gonna go off and say this is

100
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,419
the way to go without trying to

101
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,910
customize it to the area you work and

102
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,728
then another final bad idea is just

103
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,620
coming into it with your own idea what

104
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,479
the results are gonna be and then just

105
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,860
not letting the answer you know that not

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:32,219
changing that if the answer is different

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:34,340
than what you expect alright so you have

108
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,410
your why you know why you want to

109
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,359
evaluate your initiative know how do you

110
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,720
move forward from there there are really

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,639
two major frameworks that are commonly

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,270
used to evaluate your security

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
initiative

114
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,799
those are BCM and open sam so those are

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,419
the two I'm gonna be talking about today

116
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
there are some other kind of minor

117
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,729
efforts out there but these are really

118
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,999
the big ones so open Sam

119
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:02,460
is a framework that is used to help

120
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,469
organizations formulate and implement a

121
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,568
strategy for software security so it's

122
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:09,330
tailored to specific risk of faith and

123
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:12,029
organization this isn't a wasp project

124
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,139
and nice thing about it is it's all like

125
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:17,400
open source the community is opinions

126
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,409
influence this they have a lot of great

127
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,659
templates that you can use to conduct an

128
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:25,740
assessment so all of those are really

129
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:28,650
strong things current version is 1.5 but

130
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,370
200 is in beta so you know that's

131
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,539
suppose to be rolled out really soon 1 5

132
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,770
2017 that's the version I'm gonna talk

133
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,149
about because it's the officially

134
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,659
released version but there is a newer

135
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:41,039
version coming coming out soon

136
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:42,688
both of these models are all released

137
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,308
under Creative Commons so I'm going to

138
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,680
use some of the material from it you can

139
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:49,229
freely use material so that's something

140
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,759
that's really nice about both of them so

141
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,960
the thing to take away from open Sammo

142
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,029
if this is a framework of best practices

143
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,859
put together by a community of experts

144
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:01,020
so these are people out there who know

145
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,639
about how security initiatives run and

146
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,409
say here's what this should look like

147
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,120
they give you some benchmarks for

148
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:10,259
different kinds of organizations have

149
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,300
lots of great information beat them so

150
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,569
beat them is takes a totally different

151
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,249
approach instead of a bunch of experts

152
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,680
telling you what they think you should

153
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:22,169
be doing it goes out there and says what

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,270
is the industry doing so it basically

155
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,219
goes out this is besom 10th for the last

156
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,808
ten years they've gone out and said you

157
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,339
know it's survey that a number of

158
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:31,620
organizations this year they're up to

159
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:34,589
122 and said which of these activities

160
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,439
are you performing and then they you

161
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:41,129
know you collect all that data organize

162
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,080
it give you different levels where you

163
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:45,659
know more common activities less common

164
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,878
activities it's really just descriptive

165
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:49,110
this is not telling you this is what

166
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,879
experts think you should be doing

167
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,499
instead of saying here's what the

168
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,990
industry is doing today

169
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:56,839
so also great information but comes that

170
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,490
up from a totally different perspective

171
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,110
and there's an assumption built into

172
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,610
this that if similar comprehend

173
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,919
companies are performing this activity

174
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,930
it's the best practice so to me that's

175
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,979
probably the weakest part of besom

176
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,360
there's kind of this implicit assumption

177
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,180
hey people are doing it must be a good

178
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,160
idea and I think many cases that holds

179
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,440
true but I think as you're looking at

180
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,090
beefs and results always keep that in

181
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,620
mind because sometimes industry is doing

182
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,469
something that turns out not to be that

183
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,170
great of an idea all right so the other

184
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,330
thing is besom is a study that was

185
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,940
conducted and maintained by sigil which

186
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,219
is now owned by synopsis so it's you

187
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,200
know not quite as free and open it's

188
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,020
still under the Creative Commons license

189
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,760
but it's the company is the one that

190
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,770
makes the decision about what goes into

191
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,560
it how the studies conducted all of that

192
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,000
stuff they publish the data at high

193
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,650
level but there's may have lots of other

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,510
data that you have to go you know

195
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,140
subscribe to them in order to get access

196
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,840
to they have a conference but again you

197
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,280
have to be a paying paying synopsises

198
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,960
your consultant in order to be

199
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,299
participating in their conference where

200
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,820
as open sam you can go to you know

201
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,440
participate in their select channel they

202
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,780
they have sessions at some of the OWASP

203
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,750
conferences that kind of thing so that's

204
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,630
kind of a high-level overview of the two

205
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,700
different models let me dig a little bit

206
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,430
deeper for you so what one of the

207
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,700
frameworks look like and this is open

208
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,950
Sam it has four different business

209
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:28,030
functions governance construction

210
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:30,039
verification operations under each of

211
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,110
these business functions are several

212
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,659
different security practices strategy

213
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,400
and metrics policy and compliance

214
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,689
education and guidance threat assessment

215
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,069

implementation review security testing

218
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,400
issue management environment hardening

219
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,950
and operational enablement

220
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,290
when you do an open Sam assessment each

221
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,720
of these areas has a series of

222
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,250
guidelines underneath so they'll have a

223
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,570
series of questions about are you doing

224
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,970
this are you doing this are you doing

225
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,770
this that allows them to assess whether

226
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,370
your what your maturity level each of

227
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,569
these different practice areas is let's

228
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,920
really quickly compare this to how

229
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,920
they've structured visa

230
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:17,630
so you can see that um like open Sam B

231
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,060
Sam has four different major areas they

232
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,520
call them domains government's

233
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,579
intelligence SS DL touch points and

234
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,670
deployment underneath that are a bunch

235
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,980
of practices that again all these kind

236
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,410
of roughly map to open Sam so structure

237
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,720
wise they're pretty similar underneath

238
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,490
each of these practices B sim has a

239
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,620
bunch of activities so they call them

240
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,960
activities specific items that they ask

241
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,730
are you doing this and ultimately what B

242
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,460
sim consists of is a list of those

243
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,080
activities and yes knows about whether

244
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:53,540
each of these companies is performing

245
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,920
that activity all right so just

246
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,380
comparing again it's they're very

247
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,449
similar in structure right so you can

248
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,640
see that each have four major areas and

249
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,350
then a bunch of sub areas that they've

250
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,090
broken these down into there's some

251
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,340
differences that ultimately they're

252
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,570
they're pretty darn close that's what

253
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,280
you'd expect right they're assessing

254
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,140
basically the same thing if they were

255
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,140
hugely different you and wondering like

256
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:18,949
what was going on one of them would be

257
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,270
off course for sure all right so how do

258
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,980
you figure out which one of these to use

259
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,780
if you want to assess your security

260
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,420
initiative that's a question we confront

261
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,890
it and so we kind of looked at like what

262
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,060
makes them different what's the same and

263
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,590
like I said the biggest thing that's

264
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,729
different is that they're really trying

265
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,100
to do different things

266
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,530
besom is trying to give you data about

267
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,420
what's going on in the industry and open

268
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,790
Sam is telling you what experts think

269
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,349
you should be doing be someone has some

270
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,089
actual published data and their white

271
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,450
paper saying here's what we discovered

272
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:49,280
and open Sam's more of a targets that

273
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,830
they've said that they think are best

274
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,240
practices another hand open samuel is a

275
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,890
bunch of templates that are ready to go

276
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,240
that you can easily use to start

277
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:01,160
assessing your organization and then you

278
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,810
know they both have communities the open

279
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,400
sam communities a little bit more a

280
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:08,839
little bit more open it's a little bit

281
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,360
easier to access of course you can do

282
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,520
both right so that was the answer we

283
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
came to that we like both of these they

284
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,670
have different information for us we

285
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,530
want to do both of them

286
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,969
we started with besom because we wanted

287
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,560
to get through that assessment against

288
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,300
the industry best practices that are

289
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,069
going on now but

290
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,660
then our intention is to move in to also

291
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,370
do open Sam and then compare and

292
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,209
contrast see what kind of you know

293
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,339
differences come up there we also been

294
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:36,589
so we're once you figure that out how do

295
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,389
you figure out how to conduct the

296
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,980
assessment itself there's a couple of

297
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,449
different strategies like looked at

298
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,519
either doing bringing in a consultant

299
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,260
and paying them to do this assessment

300
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,529
and then we looked at maybe doing it

301
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,110
in-house too and there's different ways

302
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,430
you can approach the assessment you can

303
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,380
go into if you're going to do it

304
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,300
in-house you can do it at a high effort

305
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,300
kind of assessment where you're asking

306
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,370
you know a 600 question survey that

307
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,370
really digs down into the meat of all of

308
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,850
these activities to get very detailed

309
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,579
results you can conduct interviews you

310
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,529
can do an analysis validate results with

311
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:14,689
tests that's the kind of thing that a

312
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,250
consultant is likely to want to do if

313
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,680
you bring them in and you can do that

314
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,100
in-house too but you have other options

315
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,739
you can do a more moderate level effort

316
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,690
which would involve maybe a longer

317
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,199
survey you know interviews unless

318
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,940
they're necessary it we did maybe not

319
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,139
necessarily going back and testing and

320
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:38,449
validating the results you're getting

321
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:41,029
yes it could be for either of them

322
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:43,699
they're open open Sam already has a

323
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,050
model built up that with a set of

324
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:50,269
questions so you'd probably want to

325
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:52,130
adhere to the existing modeling yeah so

326
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,579
they do so I agree with that

327
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,800
but I will say e and so this is more

328
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:59,449
directly applicable to be sim even for

329
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,829
open Sam because they have that model

330
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:06,050
that you may want to a lot of the effort

331
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,699
the items on there you may want to dig

332
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,079
deeper to make sure the answers you're

333
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:11,479
getting are accurate and ask the same

334
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,829
question in different ways so what the

335
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,360
reason why I'm saying that is we went

336
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,069
and looked at what other what consult

337
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,500
outside consultants do we tried to get

338
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,779
some surveys they've conducted and a lot

339
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,660
of them are much deeper than the basic

340
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:27,560
one that opens and gives you so yeah

341
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,030
and I'll talk a little bit more about

342
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,349
more of that in a second and then

343
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,370
there's a lightweight approach right so

344
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,070
you can do a lightweight approach is

345
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,560
much more like just ask 150 question 100

346
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,270
question survey and send it out to suit

347
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,400
some folks maybe do some follow-up

348
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,829
interviews it's needed analyze results

349
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,740
so we ended up doing this so we kind of

350
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,140
shifted strategies initially our scope

351
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,600
was to go out to other sister

352
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,640
organizations and assess them as well as

353
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,140
our own internal organization and when

354
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,480
we were gonna do that we were thinking

355
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,280
more like this moderate level approach

356
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,260
because we going into outside

357
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,030
organizations and in that case you want

358
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,340
to ask the same questions different ways

359
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,560
maybe do more interviews really gather

360
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,910
you know data to make sure that they're

361
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,060
answering the question and the way it's

362
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,010
asked then we kind of down scoped and

363
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,500
decided we do our internal organization

364
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,050
first with intent later maybe next year

365
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,450
start assessing other organizations so

366
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:26,839
we've decided this more lightweight

367
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:28,490
approach would work for us all right so

368
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,130
let me let me move on so that's how you

369
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,630
might conduct the assessment and I

370
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,160
wanted to it's a question I always get

371
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,390
as point is people are curious though

372
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,400
what kind of things are you gonna find

373
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,360
when you're doing your assessment of

374
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,340
your organization

375
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,840
so there's tons information in both of

376
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,250
these models and I highly recommend if

377
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,750
you're interested in this go out and

378
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,310
read some of that material even if

379
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,290
you're not gonna do the full analysis

380
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,239
honestly it's pretty interesting to see

381
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,949
what kind of things other organizations

382
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,320
are doing what kind of things are kind

383
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,210
of coming up so I highly recommend that

384
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,190
but I can give you just kind of a little

385
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:03,440
bit a sample of what to expect so that'd

386
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,630
be sim for example found in the in their

387
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,060
data sets was that there's kind of this

388
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,400
this path that most organizations follow

389
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,310
and it's pretty similar for most

390
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,170
organizations an organization that's

391
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,579
getting started kind of has these in

392
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,770
these major areas structure

393
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,350
prioritization and visibility I kind of

394
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,170
do the same things they named someone

395
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,880
who is the owner for the software

396
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,490
security initiatives that's what SSI

397
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,260
stands for here they generate some kind

398
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,240
of awareness about security within the

399
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,670
organization and then they find some

400
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,100
kind of peer within engineering who will

401
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,410
also kind of own security

402
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,200
they figure out what their top 10 things

403
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,510
to focus on are so that right bugs or

404
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,610
attacks or whatever is most relevant to

405
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,819
your organization and they prioritize

406
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:54,330
those and then they select some

407
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,130
additional controls to implement then

408
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,470
you know their next focus is on

409
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,000
inventory asset so they need to know

410
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,580
what they're really protecting out there

411
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,440
some work some organizations that's much

412
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,530
harder to figure out than others and

413
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,300
doing defect discovery determinate the

414
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,949
issues around production what do they

415
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,750
need to care about so all this makes

416
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,360
sense to me and this is uh directly

417
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,550
cribbed from besom they had this nice

418
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,780
little checklist out there it shows that

419
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,160
you know you really need to go through

420
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,589
this kind of make sure this is in place

421
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,689
to get your SSI started you need some

422
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,520
leadership you didn't know your software

423
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,880
is you need to figure out what's in

424
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,560
scope for your effort you want to make

425
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,480
sure your host and network security is

426
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,069
in place because that's that's not out

427
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,000
there like you know keep hearing if

428
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,370
you've been going to some of these

429
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,720
sessions about the cloud they keep all

430
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,700
of them start out by saying things like

431
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,320
no this is an application security

432
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,800
conference but if you don't have your

433
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,210
cloud infrastructure in place then

434
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,680
application security doesn't matter and

435
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:54,950
I think that's true here figure out what

436
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,900
kind of problems you have like control

437
00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:00,780
repeat so that's where most

438
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,600
organizations start where do they go

439
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,879
from there from there are they looking

440
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,980
at really documenting and socializing

441
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,339
their secure software development

442
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,110
lifecycle they start looking at

443
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,119
balancing detective and preventative

444
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:17,490
control and what that means is you know

445
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,079
folks start by saying let's prevent

446
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,280
problems and that's you know because

447
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,959
that's their first like here's the fire

448
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,579
let's go find that fire and put it out

449
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,500
then they start getting to the point

450
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,270
where they say okay how can we prevent

451
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,520
these fires from happening right so

452
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,500
let's push it to the left figure out how

453
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,110
we can build security into the process

454
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,330
early on so we don't drive these

455
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,090
vulnerabilities down at the end so that

456
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,129
becomes more of a focus they start

457
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,050
taking feedback from their Incident

458
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,180
Response Team and driving it back to

459
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,470
development so that they again can

460
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,140
prevent these problems from happening

461
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,150
and then this is a theme you're gonna

462
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,159
hear more security

463
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,110
more integrated into or and/or

464
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:56,669
originating from engineering so a lot of

465
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,889
organizations start with this separate

466
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:01,289
organization that's all about software

467
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,809
security and then what happens is

468
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,370
engineering the development teams start

469
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:07,470
taking more and more ownership of

470
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,360
security doesn't mean the centralized

471
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,370
organization goes away it's just that

472
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,799
the responsibility gets shared this is a

473
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,199
really good thing you see engineering as

474
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,779
you see developers you see architects IT

475
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,020
managers kind of really driving okay how

476
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,429
can we make make ourselves more secure

477
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,840
and I liked this quote from BCM because

478
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:28,110
it can capture some of that in that

479
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,389
evolution right there observation is

480
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,158
that engineering lead groups are

481
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,890
starting with open source and homegrown

482
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:38,940
security tools with much less reliance

483
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:41,190
on these big box vulnerability generally

484
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,690
these groups hold the two heuristics and

485
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,820
I've seen this over and over again tree

486
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,090
lengthening time to or preventing

487
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,158
delivery is unacceptable instead you've

488
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,049
to organized to provide telemetry and

489
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,059
then respond asynchronously through

490
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:57,090
virtual patching rollback or other

491
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:59,039
compensating controls vulnerability to

492
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,750
detective capability incrementally in

493
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,090
line with a growing understanding of

494
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,070
software misuse and abuse and associated

495
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,570
business risk rather than purchasing

496
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,860
bark security standards as part of a

497
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,908
vendors core rule set so I thought that

498
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,370
was an interesting quote kind of

499
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:16,890
captures that evolution all right so

500
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,510
once you're kind of past maturing or you

501
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,029
know really solid there how do you

502
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,890
optimize they found that organizations

503
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:26,429
that are trying to optimize start

504
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,840
knowing what that top 10 risks or issues

505
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,309
are and they start driving them down

506
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,439
they relentlessly start saying okay

507
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,908
here's our number-one problem let's get

508
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,490
rid of that one okay what's number two

509
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:38,789
let's start driving that down can I go

510
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:41,070
down that let's tool customization so

511
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,669
leaders start placing effort on tuning

512
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,220
their tools

513
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:46,409
alright so improve accuracy consistency

514
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:50,390
and depth of analysis we have the tools

515
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:50,390
in place now how do we use them better

516
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:58,199
feedback loops so that means you take

517
00:19:54,809 --> 00:20:00,210
take relevant information from each part

518
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,830
of your software secure software

519
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,850
development lifecycle and then feed it

520
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:08,129
back to development

521
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:10,259
and then you start using data or okay so

522
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,230
overall like across again these imps

523
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,700
been produced for 10 years now what kind

524
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,320
of trends have they seen recently that

525
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,389
have been things that weren't big in the

526
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,240
past that maybe have become bigger more

527
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:24,299
recently here are their top three areas

528
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,490
they see popping up so first of all

529
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,470
agile friendly software security

530
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,840
initiatives I think you know anybody an

531
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,279
organization that most organizations out

532
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,990
there starting to say hey how do we

533
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,120
become agile or we're agile how do we

534
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,440
can you do that and then the big one of

535
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,209
the big questions within security in

536
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,490
general right now is how do we work with

537
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,230
an agile software development team and

538
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,179
still make sure that they're producing

539
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,879
software that meets the quality

540
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:50,519
standards that we have and that's a huge

541
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:53,459
challenge and one of the answers is

542
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,169
dead-set cops right so as we automate

543
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,809
our DevOps

544
00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:00,240
chain we start asking what how do we

545
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:04,320
make sure security is a piece of that

546
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,789
automated devops chain and then you know

547
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,399
here's that the phrase again we talked

548
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:10,500
about engineering lead security so that

549
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:12,629
means it's bottom-up from dev and

550
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,240
operations and here's what these great

551
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:17,879
quotes they had in their emerging

552
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,789
engineering divet driven groups tend to

553
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:22,860
view security as an enabler of software

554
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,960
features and code quality these groups

555
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,149
recognize the need for having security

556
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,940
standards but they tend to prefer

557
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:32,399
governance as code I love that idea

558
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,669
right we're having infrastructure as

559
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:34,889
code

560
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:37,139
now let's governmentís code as opposed

561
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:39,479
to manual steps with human review

562
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:41,370
approach to enforcement right so we in

563
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,139
order to get security embedded in our

564
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,879
chain it needs to be automated let's

565
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:46,289
face it ultimately we can't have people

566
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:47,789
looking at all this stuff

567
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:50,940
we got to figure out how to make it more

568
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:52,769
and more automated this tends to result

569
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,889
in engineers building security features

570
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:57,019
and frameworks into the architectures

571
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:59,789
automating defect discovery techniques

572
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:01,740
within a software delivery pipeline and

573
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:04,700
training security defects just like any

574
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,019
other defect traditional human driven

575
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,679
security decisions are modeled into

576
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:12,779
Software Defined workflow opposed to

577
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,129
written into a document document and

578
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:15,800
then implemented in a separate risk

579
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:18,500
workflow handle outside of an

580
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,480
in this type of culture it's not that

581
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,490
the traditional SDLC gates and risk

582
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,560
decisions go away is that they get

583
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,120
implemented differently and they usually

584
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,600
have different goals prepared to those

585
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,820
of governance driven groups so I think

586
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,800
this is fascinating evolution and that's

587
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,689
been captured here in this model I think

588
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,250
it's hugely relevant to most

589
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,410
organizations and something we need to

590
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,700
figure out like you know it's we're in

591
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,470
this kind of flux state where we're

592
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,590
making the shift from governance driven

593
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:48,110
to engineering driven from these outside

594
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,449
controls to automated from this you know

595
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:56,030
traditional waterfall model to more

596
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:58,850
agile model so that's pretty cool all

597
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,860
right so what I'm gonna show you I was

598
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,990
gonna pull up some of the beasts impact

599
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,219
if 'ti kind of get a sense of getting

600
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,330
down into the meat of it and see what

601
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,030
kind of questions they're asking

602
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,580
actually asking making Sam spreadsheet

603
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,320
just to really see what it looks like I

604
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:18,020
did put both of these out here on the

605
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:20,210
the session site and sched and the BCAM

606
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,830
survey is basically it took the data and

607
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,240
put it in Fred sheet so all of the

608
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:27,110
activities they have and then I added

609
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,850
the percentage of the number of there

610
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,100
the percentage of the total number of

611
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,230
there were respondents who were doing

612
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,209
that activity so it has a percent on

613
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,680
there it's kind of a quick way to get a

614
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,560
sense of like you how you stack up

615
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:41,720
against their organization's what a

616
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:46,550
second let me see if I get that up for

617
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,870
you all right so this is again this this

618
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,120
is something I threw together myself

619
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:53,750
it's all the data is freely available on

620
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,629
the BCM the besom site the besom ten

621
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,190
package I'm gonna zoom in on this in

622
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,960
just a second so we can read it better I

623
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,780
just want to talk about what this look

624
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,240
is how its laid out so we have at the

625
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,980
top to be just a title then so each of

626
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,750
the domains we talked about are in blue

627
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,870
so we talked about four domains this

628
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,030
one's in governance the each of the

629
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,770
practice areas is in yellow so this is

630
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,420
under strategy and metrics and then each

631
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,280
of those practice areas has a number of

632
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,250
activities whatever number they have

633
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,770
observed in their data as they collected

634
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,800
and they also like I said they had all

635
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,080
had statistics about who how many people

636
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,940
how many of organizations

637
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,379
doing these I took the percentage and

638
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,210
this is kind of just a rough way of

639
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,880
evaluating kind of how your

640
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:39,760
organization's got except it's generally

641
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,560
like more frequent less frequent so for

642
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,940
example sixty six point four percent of

643
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,530
the organization's reporting its

644
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,790
activity that might be something you

645
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,920
guys would if you if you aren't doing

646
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,620
this why not right I mean I'd hope so

647
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,610
this is like one of the basic ones but

648
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,699
that kind of gives you an idea of what

649
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:57,610
to look at and what not to look at so if

650
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,170
you were doing a quick besom assessment

651
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,629
and house you might take a survey like

652
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,960
this and send it out to all of your

653
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:06,430
software Security Initiative team you

654
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,130
might send it out to a couple of

655
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,780
Architects developer maybe to see what

656
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,580
they think how they think about it so

657
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,200
that's what we did and the reason why we

658
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,820
picked not just the security team but

659
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,830
also some folks outside of the security

660
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,050
team so we have an idea about what we're

661
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,210
doing but we wanted somebody outside of

662
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:28,870
us to say are you are they seeing that

663
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:31,450
right like some of these are about are

664
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,399
you communicating things out to the rest

665
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,020
of the organization and yeah we think we

666
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,910
are right we're like yeah we publish all

667
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,740
our processes we put all that stuff out

668
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,840
there we hold the lunch and learns we do

669
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,300
this session but if we send the survey

670
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,490
out to an architect or developer or a

671
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,350
19-minute or whoever and they say well

672
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,150
no I've never heard of that well that's

673
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,139
really good information for us right

674
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,430
that's a great it's almost like a

675
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,520
customer survey are you getting the

676
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:57,340
message we're sending out to you so we

677
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,980
did that let me zoom it out here so how

678
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,240
this works we can little bit closer so

679
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,980
you can see what it looks like all right

680
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,050
so there are activities here on the Left

681
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,330
first one for example is published

682
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,100
process and involved it's necessary now

683
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,949
so they have this kind of short summary

684
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,449
but be sure you read the full

685
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,280
description because it gives a lot of

686
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,050
detail about exactly what do they mean

687
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,270
by that when they go out and they do

688
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:21,490
this survey how do they figure out if an

689
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,990
organization is doing this activity they

690
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,910
have to meet the criteria in this

691
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,130
description and when I was talking about

692
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:29,350
doing like a longer six hundred question

693
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,420
survey it would be pulling out like each

694
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,340
of the criteria in the more detailed

695
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,890
section and asking those so you wouldn't

696
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,780
just ask the team are we publishing

697
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,550
processes and evolving as necessary

698
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,580
instead you'd get in here and you'd say

699
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,139
you know you'd be the process

700
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,000
addressing software security it's

701
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,890
published so you'd ask something like is

702
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,200
it published

703
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:52,470
is it broadcast all stakeholders so that

704
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,970
everybody knows the plan etc are your

705
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:57,090
goals roles responsibilities and

706
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,500
activities explicitly defined all right

707
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,449
so it goes if you're not doing all of

708
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,860
those things you don't get a YES on this

709
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,100
activity if you're doing kind of some

710
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,290
sort of so on besom it's really a yes or

711
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,870
no it's kind of survey so you could come

712
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:13,500
over here and like I said this is out on

713
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,629
the my sessions page so you can you

714
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,530
welcome to take it and use it as you

715
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:21,960
want it's all open and shared licensing

716
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,240
so you just liked yes or no and again if

717
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,980
you were a know here in 66% of the

718
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,600
organizations or yes that's kind of

719
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,280
something to look at it so it's not

720
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,330
necessarily bad some of these everybody

721
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,950
else might be doing but your

722
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,730
organization doesn't need to do it and

723
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,750
that's okay too

724
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:38,340
it's really just a discussion point so

725
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,530
another next question for example is

726
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,480
create evangelism role and perform

727
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,920
internal marketing right and if you're

728
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,260
kind of like what is that like what's

729
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,090
the evangelism role right and there's

730
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,680
more detailed open the white paper but

731
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:52,199
there's also just a better description

732
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,910
here of what that means range to build

733
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,520
some support for your software security

734
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,530
throughout the organization somebody in

735
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,389
the software security group must play

736
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,250
and evangelism role right somebody goes

737
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,380
out there and performs a more marketing

738
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,660
function helps keep executives and other

739
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,400
stakeholders up to date on the magnitude

740
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,700
of the software security problem and

741
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,470
elements of its solution so for our

742
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,540
organization for example we do have

743
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:20,940
somebody who does that and I'd probably

744
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:22,860
say yes 54% of the organization's do so

745
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,780
it goes through line by line next one if

746
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,520
for example is educate executives right

747
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,500
and this was an interesting one

748
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,360
executives are periodically showing the

749
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,860
consequences of inadequate software

750
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,810
security and the negative business

751
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,330
impact it can have on the organization

752
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,919
it goes any more detail for example this

753
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,590
one I don't know that we do this

754
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,910
consistently great so I might say no and

755
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,439
this would be something to look at them

756
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,150
because fifty nine point eight percent

757
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,330
of organizations said they were doing

758
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,290
this so that's um that's the value of

759
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,970
this and he goes through again like I

760
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,340
said there's a hundred and twenty

761
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,380
activities within the

762
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,559
some framework you can go through line

763
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,600
by line read all the details again it's

764
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,240
useful and even information even if you

765
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,330
don't go do the full assessment so

766
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,700
that's kind of besom Sam has a different

767
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,529
approach today so this is there and

768
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,570
again they have lots of templates and

769
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:14,120
other material out in the full package

770
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,100
out on at the link that I has in the

771
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,080
presentation but this is their core

772
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:23,029
package this is their assessment toolbox

773
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:25,129
and their approach and I really like

774
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:26,360
this approach too so this is a pretty

775
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,010
interesting it's like I said

776
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,469
complementary I think both of these are

777
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,270
very valuable is they have this

778
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,100
spreadsheet already set up for you it's

779
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,990
an interview spreadsheet and it takes

780
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,000
each of these items under each of the

781
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,919
different sections and says you know is

782
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,169
there a software security assurance

783
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,669
program in place and there's guidance

784
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,289
about what that means so assurance

785
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:48,080
program is documented accessible to the

786
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:50,330
staff assurance program has been used in

787
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,070
recent development efforts staff

788
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,629
receives training against Insurance

789
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,700
Program and responsibilities and then

790
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:58,460
your answer instead of being yes we're

791
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,470
doing it or no can be a little bit more

792
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,450
nuanced yes it's less than a year old

793
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,039
yes it's a number of years old yes it's

794
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,230
a pretty mature program so we might say

795
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,049
yeah we're doing it but it's only been

796
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,429
looking at your we've been doing this

797
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:12,260
next question is our development staff

798
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,360
aware of future plans for the assurance

799
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,820
program assurance program goals are

800
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,408
document accessible to staff assurance

801
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,779
program goals have been presented to

802
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:22,460
staff a plan has been put in place to

803
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,200
reach those goals in a specific period

804
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,220
of time and we might look at that and

805
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,230
say yes small percentage yes at least

806
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,940
half yes majority so I would say maybe

807
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,399
yes at least half that seems reasonable

808
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,159
and then you can come a little bit

809
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,590
further down and you can see for this

810
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,899
particular area there's three three

811
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,580
questions third one is do the business

812
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:46,850
stakeholders understand your

813
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,710
organization's risk profile and it gives

814
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,330
you some nuanced answers and I let's say

815
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,770
we'll say yes at least half of them are

816
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,210
or do and you can see if you're

817
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:58,429
selecting these it automatically

818
00:30:53,210 --> 00:31:00,799
produces a rating play equivalent to

819
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:02,450
what percentage are you doing this so as

820
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,889
you select answers that are more mature

821
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:07,830
you'd get a higher rating you get up to

822
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:10,410
one if you select the lower answers it's

823
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,060
it's a lower rating so that's kind of

824
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,460
nice it's all set up to automatically

825
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,860
calculate that for you but in addition

826
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,870
it has this cool school scorecard it

827
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,330
copies all of that information into this

828
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:23,250
scorecard which allows you to see you

829
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,520
know how your how mature you are in each

830
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:29,730
of these different areas right it has

831
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,020
this spider chart here as you fill in

832
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:35,070
the whole interview it'll fill in the

833
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,050
spider chart and you're fades for

834
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,909
maturity scores so phase four let me

835
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:43,560
move on here because the other neat

836
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:46,170
thing about this is it's about this is

837
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:48,450
you can see where you are now all right

838
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:50,880
here's your current state and then you

839
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,370
can also set up a road map you can say

840
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,320
hey we know where we are now where where

841
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,330
do we want to be in phase 1 phase 2

842
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,399
phase 3 what do you know whenever that

843
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,740
might be maybe these are years right you

844
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,930
can say we are at a point for here but

845
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,750
baseboard we want to be at a 100 right

846
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:09,210
or whatever that is and so that's nice

847
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,220
because very clearly map's back to

848
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,050
specific activities you need to be doing

849
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,090
and you can check yourself along the way

850
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,889
to see are you hitting these targets or

851
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:21,870
are you not hitting these targets and

852
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:27,270
that can be extremely useful all right

853
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:29,659
so that is the basics of beat cement

854
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:32,310
open Sam like I said there's tons more

855
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,750
out there and I can go into great deal

856
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,070
in this session because it's just

857
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,150
there's just too much out there but let

858
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,919
me stop for a minute if you need to get

859
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,930
a hold of me later on first of all email

860
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,800
if you want to get a hold of me but

861
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,270
right now let me see if there any

862
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,960
questions or anything else I could delve

863
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,960
into for you

864
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,809
yeah yeah so uh this there's a site for

865
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,640
this this court this session right where

866
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:55,809
you go out and you can rate the session

867
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,429
and all that kind of stuff and there's

868
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,899
also the presentations are out there

869
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:02,650
it's all out there

870
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:09,520
yeah it should be yeah I put it put it

871
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:13,690
out with that so let me see if I open

872
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:17,799
him you know okay there we go yeah I put

873
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:20,650
them all on here the presentation so yep

874
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:23,049
and again this is just this one is that

875
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,330
one's one I made so that's again it's

876
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:27,309
just supplementary to the BCAM material

877
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,590
that's out there this is just basically

878
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:32,080
copy and pasted from the Sam work they

879
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,240
have a zip file with this tool box and

880
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,918
some other materials so you can

881
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:45,940
certainly get that same file from them

882
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:48,190
as well yep we did yes we just know we

883
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:52,240
haven't we finished the BCM portion and

884
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:54,130
I'm more we are just starting into the

885
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,750
sand portion so we're gonna probably do

886
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:59,320
that over the next six months depending

887
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:01,360
on that's a good question so we ended up

888
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,040
doing both of them in-house initially

889
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,750
but we probably like an another we'll

890
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,280
probably bring in consultants in six

891
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,679
months to a year and kind of compare and

892
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,879
contrast results so we decided to kind

893
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,980
of take both approaches we were

894
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,009
interested in first of all getting it

895
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:18,190
done now but also saying how how the

896
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:20,710
results different as well we want to

897
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:23,139
first of all be able to show where we

898
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,210
stack up against industry right now and

899
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,830
against best practices so we want to

900
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,720
understand we think we have a good at

901
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,369
the sense of where we're at relative to

902
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,259
the industry but it's great to have that

903
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,679
hard data from the outside so that we

904
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,899
were just validating our own assumptions

905
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,668
but in addition again we have people

906
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:42,638
some of it some people in leadership who

907
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:44,859
you know don't always trust our view of

908
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,740
what you know what kind of resources we

909
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:49,989
need where we need to be investing so we

910
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:52,600
want to have evidence to show them that

911
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:54,729
the direction we think we need to head

912
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,960
is the right direction or if the results

913
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,400
show is not the right direction maybe

914
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,050
that's a good question for us maybe

915
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,670
we're wrong

916
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,410
about where we think we need to go and

917
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,300
then the end result is definitely going

918
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:05,520
to be a road map you know there may be

919
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,010
very much like kind of like those open

920
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,120
Sam map we just showed where here's

921
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,940
where we're at here's our current

922
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,560
benchmark here's where we'd like to go

923
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,270
long-term but we want to

924
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,090
we'd like to validate that it gets more

925
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,770
than one model so it's it's taken us a

926
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,570
while but a lot of that's resource

927
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,550
availability honestly something like

928
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:25,440
this tensed it with you a busy

929
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,900
development shop this is gonna get

930
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,350
pushed down to a lower priority it just

931
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,690
is and that can be okay depending on you

932
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,880
know your urgency for us it's taken

933
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,460
quite a while to get it going I would

934
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,190
say that you could do this in a couple

935
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,950
months if you wanted to if you you know

936
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,900
spend we really need to develop devote a

937
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,609
little time to just reading the material

938
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,770
understanding and putting together your

939
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,300
assessment materials that's gonna be a

940
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,130
good chunk of time that might be could

941
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,710
be done in a couple weeks if you had the

942
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,540
resources to devote to it then you need

943
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,190
to it's really getting the feedback from

944
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,400
people can be a challenge people's time

945
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,110
is always tight again I you know we are

946
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,660
in the process of doing another set of

947
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,340
surveys and it's just so hard to get

948
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,960
people to complete these and get them

949
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,670
back in any kind of timely manner

950
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,800
because they'll have other things going

951
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,990
on so you know if you allocate a couple

952
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,790
more weeks for that the part that really

953
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,970
I think takes should take the most time

954
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:23,670
is evaluating your results and compiling

955
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,200
them into a coherent kind of white paper

956
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,120
because you want to make sure you're

957
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,710
making good recommendations right

958
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,089
understanding the data you're getting

959
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,430
back maybe going back and doing

960
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,200
follow-up interviews if needed if you

961
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:37,049
one of the things we're finding is when

962
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,580
we have very discrepant results right so

963
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,290
when one person's saying yes we're doing

964
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,990
this and you have two more people saying

965
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:44,190
no we are not doing this the real value

966
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,689
is in getting some of those people

967
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,640
together and saying okay let's

968
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,740
understand why you thought we were doing

969
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,740
this and you didn't yeah that's really

970
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,379
an organism for our organization it is

971
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,450
ultimately owned by the VP of our

972
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,790
division so we've we've gotten that kind

973
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,049
of ownership from him because for the

974
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,400
reasons you're talking about you need to

975
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,990
be accountability you're not just for

976
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,600
completing it but also for following up

977
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,129
on the results so we have gone up it

978
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,750
depends on how your organization's

979
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,220
structured right I can see it if you

980
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,290
have a C so type role

981
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,970
be under that kind of role so we do have

982
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,710
our developers under a different manager

983
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,930
than a security team and we have

984
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,099
different IT managers over different

985
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,740
development groups that's something they

986
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:24,359
have so our strategy was we again we

987
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,098
went up to the VP who's over all of

988
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,840
those people we that was important to us

989
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,599
we needed to get buy-in from somebody

990
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,849
who had control who has influence over

991
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,830
all of the folks we need support from

992
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:35,700
that was number one I don't know if we

993
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:38,790
could have done it would have been

994
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:41,339
effective if we hadn't done that we did

995
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,869
it take an approach of doing just

996
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,000
sending out a questionnaire first and

997
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:46,560
then because it's just hard like again

998
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,210
we wanted it to be a low effort as

999
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,650
possible to start with right so we

1000
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,910
decided because we first were like oh

1001
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,349
yeah we're gonna totally interview all

1002
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,569
these people we're gonna do all of this

1003
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,310
and and you know we could have done that

1004
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:58,200
but I think it would have we wanted to

1005
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,540
get better buy-in so we're like no you

1006
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,250
know what let's take the the let's just

1007
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,109
send you here it's just so you know it's

1008
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,030
only gonna take an hour so two hours

1009
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:07,380
maybe here's a hundred questions you can

1010
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,359
answer a hundred questions can't even

1011
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,580
get it back to us with the intent then

1012
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,810
to if we needed to go farther you can

1013
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,040
always go back and say hey that

1014
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,240
questionnaire you submitted we're gonna

1015
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,950
do a little follow-up just gonna take

1016
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,240
another half now that's all and you're

1017
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,460
where you're likely to get more buy-in

1018
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,799
if you kind of ease into that is my

1019
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,599
experience yeah as far as writing we're

1020
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,700
still finishing up the writing of the

1021
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,770
final report but that's probably the

1022
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,149
piece that we're investing the most in

1023
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,619
like I said I think that we want to

1024
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,000
everyone's want to be still run across

1025
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,800
something we're like we're not sure of

1026
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,849
and it's great because we're still we're

1027
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,099
in-house we're doing our own

1028
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:40,680
organization so we can easily go back

1029
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:43,200
and ask a question to follow up and get

1030
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,399
better answers for that would be a

1031
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,750
challenge if you were trying to do

1032
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,730
another organization that you were

1033
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,250
outside of right so that's something we

1034
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:53,400
moved challenged by yeah we're in the

1035
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:54,660
process of doing that it's and you know

1036
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,160
it's just some of that we were doing

1037
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,930
anyway let me just say this assessment

1038
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,750
in some sense is validating some of the

1039
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:03,569
paths we were on anyway we are for

1040
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:06,060
working very hard to integrate security

1041
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:08,369
into our project requirements early on

1042
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,020
that is has been you know in addition to

1043
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:12,570
this one of the activities I've been

1044
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,359
very actively involved in and it's a

1045
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:16,440
huge challenge we're right now we're

1046
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,569
still at a place where it's a lot of

1047
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,400
hand-holding to get them to do that so

1048
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,020
we're at the stage right now is kind of

1049
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,940
like hey you guys as soon as you

1050
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,800
are thinking about planning a project or

1051
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,260
release like let us know as soon as

1052
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,030
possible send submit this Giro ticket to

1053
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,040
us immediately as soon as that happens

1054
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,390
and a place where we're like trying to

1055
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,160
validate that we're like hey you you

1056
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,779
updated this release calendar but you

1057
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,129
didn't submit it take to the security

1058
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,380
team what's the deal maybe you should go

1059
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,120
talk to them and it's really a lot of

1060
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,550
kind of like getting them into that

1061
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,810
mindset right now the hope is we're

1062
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,920
gonna get them to that point where it's

1063
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,930
not gonna be that kind of hand-holding

1064
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,340
anymore but it's still still there I

1065
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,899
think that's an interesting alternative

1066
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,790
approach like some of the material I

1067
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,290
read suggested doing that after you do

1068
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,630
the survey kind of like you get survey

1069
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:59,490
results ok now go see if your data backs

1070
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,470
up what the survey results said right

1071
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,180
and it's but another way would be hey

1072
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,830
maybe we don't need the cert 2 survey

1073
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,109
somebody if we can get the data from

1074
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:09,870
JIRA or wherever that'd be a great point

1075
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:12,600
yeah yeah yeah you could do that you

1076
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,100
could set up maybe even an monthly

1077
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,180
meeting or a weekly you know half an

1078
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,259
hour meeting let's get together and

1079
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,270
answer a few of these questions together

1080
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,500
guys that kind of thing and then we you

1081
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,090
won't have to just spend an hour on your

1082
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,350
own as filling out sir that kind of

1083
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,270
stuff that might work I think there's

1084
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,890
lots of approaches to get the data from

1085
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,110
people that it's kind of sneaky but

1086
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,160
that's become a surprisingly large part

1087
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,810
of my job is figuring out how to

1088
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,569
sneakily get people to answer the

1089
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,640
questions I need answered so I like

1090
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,990
those ideas yeah yeah so that's

1091
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,759
something we really talked about because

1092
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,529
I'm you know that's one reason people

1093
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,240
bring in consultants right there.this

1094
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,610
don't trust that an internal team is

1095
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,080
gonna get an honest answer and so we

1096
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,520
really thought about like because we

1097
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,870
especially because initially we were

1098
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
doing it and we were like we still want

1099
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,230
to do it in-house and part of that is

1100
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,490
you know making sure that you're again

1101
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,560
getting answers from different people

1102
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,479
different roles in the organization I

1103
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,500
think that's very helpful if you can if

1104
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,000
there are even knowledgeable people

1105
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,530
outside the organization that might be

1106
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,180
helpful to getting lots of different

1107
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,890
viewpoints that way if your own

1108
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,390
intuition if somebody if you have an

1109
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,589
intuition about an answer and one of

1110
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,940
those people says something different

1111
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,010
well why aren't like you know figure

1112
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,600
that out I think that can be real

1113
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,400
helpful something we were just talking

1114
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,720
about it's just validating your results

1115
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,310
to some of these things you can actually

1116
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,080
go back and you know they're saying oh

1117
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,880
yeah we have this process that we all

1118
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,470
know about well go look if there's

1119
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,450
anybody reading that process are they

1120
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,430
following that process that kind of

1121
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:28,259
thing get some data to support at least

1122
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,520
some of these then that's pretty common

1123
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,140
so interest some of the beast and

1124
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,940
results was that like they do things

1125
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,830
like that ask how many developers do you

1126
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,420
have how many

1127
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,029
people in your app sect team and that's

1128
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,860
pretty common Nunnally yeah we're trying

1129
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,840
to be enablers rather than blockers

1130
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,280
right instead of saying oh no you can't

1131
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,340
go because security we're trying to say

1132
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,600
okay yes and right so yes you deliver

1133
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,550
several times today and we're gonna

1134
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,490
integrate security into that we're gonna

1135
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,870
make that easier for you more less less

1136
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,459
of a blocker and okay let's work

1137
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,140
together here you to figure out how to

1138
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,820
make that something that's integrated

1139
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,410
and what you do so I know that's a long

1140
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,550
term answer right because you can't do

1141
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,460
that overnight because that means

1142
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:06,530
automation that means things like making

1143
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,820
sure people are communal trains so

1144
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,860
they're thinking about security at every

1145
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,960
single step that kind of stuff all that

1146
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,550
although you know dev spec ops stuff

1147
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,800
that you hear in every but again that's

1148
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,930
it it's that is the answer but it's the

1149
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,580
long term answer the short term answer

1150
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,580
is you still have to have controls right

1151
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,410
but you also have to ask when what are

1152
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,660
your exceptions to those controls okay

1153
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,580
so and how do you what do you do to

1154
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,750
compensate for those exceptions so yes

1155
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,330
we're gonna let you go into production

1156
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,950
but that means you must do you know this

1157
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,930
scan immediately after production or you

1158
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,790
must get a pin test at this point to

1159
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,830
make sure that there was nothing that we

1160
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:42,890
missed in this or we need to make sure

1161
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:45,170
extra sure that you're doing secure code

1162
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,790
reviews on your application you need to

1163
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,590
make sure you're 100% sure you're

1164
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,270
documenting those or bringing in someone

1165
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,650
from the outside to do that whatever

1166
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,270
that may be I think there's a

1167
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,460
negotiation there right we have a whole

1168
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,520
set of things a whole toolbox of things

1169
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,230
we can use to Shuker secure code and

1170
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,030
maybe some of them are gonna fit into a

1171
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,950
quick turn oh if you're releasing

1172
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,420
several times a day some of them have to

1173
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,160
be more in parallel and just aren't

1174
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,500
going to be able to be done with every

1175
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,529
release and we need to figure out if

1176
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,880
that's okay when that's okay and that

1177
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,550
somebody's accepting the risk for that

1178
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,780
if it's happening so it may agree it's

1179
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,860
it's a challenge right I don't know that

1180
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,860
there's an easy answer unfortunately

1181
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:26,150
yeah tools automate automation really is

1182
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,620
the answer we need to get all this we

1183
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,660
know I know a lot of teams were just

1184
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,120
rushing to kind of automate this let's

1185
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,259
put it you know putting governances code

1186
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,330
right that's a way that kind of thing

1187
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,780
keep talking about so the only way to do

1188
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,779
it fast enough

1189
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:45,009
anything else yes yep

1190
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:46,869
all right anything else you guys got

1191
00:43:45,009 --> 00:43:48,009
thank you and thank you guys for

1192
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:50,109

on Friday and all that stuff you

1194
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,170

00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,040
and you didn't oh I appreciate that
