00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:42,230
Chenin leads from Intuit hi guys I'm

3
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,480
really excited to be here at last on

4
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,309
amazing venue I walked in and there were

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,550
so many people here I was like wait am I

6
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,860
in the right place and I realized yeah

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,989
actually it's Friday and there's an

8
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,850
amazing amount of apps tech talent in

9
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,589
this space and it's growing and that's

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,329
an amazing place to be so the reason why

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,830
I'm here is to talk to you a little bit

12
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,780
about quality not really actually so my

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,490
talk is about secure ability you

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,479
probably haven't heard of it yet because

15
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,390
that's what I do

16
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,460
I do things like Def suck-ups and now

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,259
I'm doing secure ability and so if you

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,899
want to do something big try to do

19
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,479
something big right have goals and

20
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,160
that's how I'm gonna get this started so

21
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,110
here for most of you I've seen some in

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,970
the room here a lot I know a lot of

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,670
faces which is awesome because this is

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,320
my fourth time back I believe and unless

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,200
I can't count which could be possible

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,940
and I'm doing a whole lot of stuff now

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
I've been in this industry for a really

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,209
long time

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,940
I tell people not to become dinosaurs

30
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,890
but I think I am a dinosaur I've been in

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,709
here for a really long time trying to do

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,560
things everything from coding to doing

33
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,200
crazy security things and really taking

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,539
on hard challenges I want to make a

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
shout out to an amazing effort that I

36
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,630
really believe in and if you haven't

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
seen it yet you need to go check this

38
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,679
out it's called dear auditor why does

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,270
that matter to all of us that want to

40
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:09,060
really just break into stuff and hack

41
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,590
and do app SEC well guess what there's

42
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,360
auditors out there and they do matter

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,069
and the things that they think about are

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,380
really important and they shape and form

45
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,910
a lot of our industry and I think this

46
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,859
is just an incredible thing that the

47
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,740
DevOps community is doing which is dear

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,840
auditor we forgot you and I think it's

49
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,580
also a tribute to the fact that I think

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,319
the devops community is really figuring

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,959
out that they also left security behind

52
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,720
and this is a way for us to actually get

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,069
security to be more relevant to our

54
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,170
developer friends so I also wanted to go

55
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,290
take a snapshot of the new look and feel

56
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,399
of the wasp stuff because I really

57
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,079
believe that having an

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,030
look and feel for the site is really an

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,709
important thing so if you haven't seen

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,450
it yet there's like in the mobile

61
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,840
security project section I actually do

62
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,459
read this site like a lot and there's

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,290
actually a link to the new site which is

64
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,940
super cool looking and I can't wait

65
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,010
until they get it up and running more

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,090
functionally or I'm even on the wrong

67
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,349
site and I just don't know and you're

68
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,420
gonna have to tell me afterwards so

69
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,760
maybe you know I kind of peruse these

70
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,109
things very frequently there's also a

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,060
super cool new project that was

72
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,190
announced in Tel Aviv if you haven't

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,709
seen as the API security project for all

74
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,660
of us apps like people that's a big deal

75
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,329
you're dealing with more and more api's

76
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,030
I find them to be fascinating they have

77
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,980
things like problems and security

78
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,780
challenges that most of us have been

79
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,280
working on for a really long time but

80
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,659
there's an actual project now dedicated

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,720
to it so with that said my talk starts

82
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,280
with a pointy headed boss and once upon

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,260
a time I wanted to be a comic artist but

84
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,810
apparently I'm not very good at it so

85
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,470
this is good it against and my pointed

86
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,269
head a pointed headed boss he basically

87
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,299
said you know we really need to make

88
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,370
security less surprising and I said okay

89
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,900
and he said we need to have test

90
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,650
coverage and metrics and I said that

91
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,510
sounds a lot like quality and for those

92
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,700
who don't know a lot of the the see says

93
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,620
I've worked for in my career have had

94
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,879
very few years of security experience

95
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,959
but they come from all walks of life

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,700
business quality you name it and most of

97
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,040
the time they think that you can do this

98
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,260
anybody know of a test coverage standard

99
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,048
for security run it and you're good

100
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,789
nothing's gonna ever happen

101
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,979
anybody oh come on I'm wait I'm looking

102
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,990
everywhere in this world right now for a

103
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,039
test coverage standard and there's a lot

104
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,510
of things out there there's the miter

105
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,849
standards there's all sorts of things

106
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,440
with CVE we can test a lot of stuff but

107
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:33,180
nobody seems to be interested in this so

108
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,219
well you know me

109
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,729
sounds hard no one else is doing it oh

110
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,530
why not let me go look for this yeah I

111
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,800
know I kind of look a little crazy now

112
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,609
right she's looking for a test coverage

113
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,710
hmm

114
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,180
security test coverage it's almost like

115
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,669
predicting the stock market is what I

116
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,750
said back to him and he said well when

117
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,530
you get good at that I guess you'll be a

118
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,790
billionaire all right so I'm on a quest

119
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,830
and

120
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,770
excited about it so again you know I do

121
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,750
things like crazy change and bang my

122
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,789
head here is really I have this sign in

123
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,770
my office for those who don't know it's

124
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,180
metal and whenever I hit my head on it

125
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,979
it actually makes the sound and

126
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:16,040
everybody realizes that I'm breaking new

127
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:17,660
ground so it all starts with 99 and if

128
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,690
you're gonna do anything crazy you go

129
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,150
back to the illa DS and when I look back

130
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,950
at the LEDs in the 1970s there was a

131
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:29,510
paper that was developed by General

132
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:31,780
Electric and the Air Force and in the

133
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,570
paper they went through this whole

134
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:39,500
research project 55 characteristics of

135
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:42,230
quality software 55 they boiled it down

136
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,310
to 11 along the way they left off a few

137
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:49,760
things apparently in the last 11 there's

138
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,750
nothing named security in it there's

139
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,969
kind of a cotton in to integrity so

140
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,150
apparently we all are working on

141
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,520
building software integrity that's

142
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,590
really what we do here according to the

143
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,419
1976 paper and I thought that was

144
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,400
interesting because what it told me is

145
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,690
we're all striving for building security

146
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,340
in anybody everybody everybody right

147
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,740
because we all use this software that's

148
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,960
actually helping us drive our cars and I

149
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,510
actually make toast that likes to figure

150
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,349
out how warm it should be and when you

151
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,510
get down to it

152
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,310
we really want to figure out how does

153
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,170
this affect us what does software look

154
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,650
like if you're gonna go do something how

155
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,810
do you measure security for software now

156
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,609
I will tell you that I sat in many rooms

157
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,010
over the course of this last couple of

158
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,050
years listening to people say we're how

159
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,420
do we measure security how many people

160
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,120
have huge dashboards lots of metrics

161
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,830
they're constantly looking to figure out

162
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,720
how to get their security stuff in there

163
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,979
somewhere so that somebody at the top of

164
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,920
the business is actually gonna care

165
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,560
about it anybody or like the people

166
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,720
above you maybe I don't know but when it

167
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,610
comes down to it I'm a security geek I

168
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,960
like to do things like break into

169
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,250
applications figure out what's wrong

170
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,830
with them and tell people hey this isn't

171
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,669
good this is how you gotta fix it and

172
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,580
hopefully it gets software to be better

173
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,390
but in the end it's still ROI for a

174
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,520
company

175
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,110
valuable is the job that we do and I

176
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,909
figured out that along the way you have

177
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,480
to have a security measure that matters

178
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:19,400
so why does 99 matter well back in the

179
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,450
day when the internet started to become

180
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,000
a thing we actually realized that

181
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,469
availability was a really big deal right

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,730
if you had an internet site and it

183
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,790
wasn't available people probably never

184
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:34,100
came back so what is 99 percent uptime

185
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,880
it means that you're down about four to

186
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,880
five days a year

187
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,229
anybody you can get fired for that

188
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,560
probably so if you build software and

189
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,150
it's down for about four days a year

190
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,410
you're out of business because nobody's

191
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,580
gonna come back and by the way you're

192
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,160
awful and you're gonna be on The Wall

193
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,969
Street Journal and how dare you have an

194
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,280
availability challenge and so now we

195
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,020
realized that 99 percent wasn't good

196
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,739
enough so four days here was bad so we

197
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,180
went down to about 500 minutes here 500

198
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,660
minutes here still gonna get fired

199
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,040
anybody yeah everybody right if you're

200
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,270
working on availability you've seen it

201
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,760
you're in a meeting and everybody's like

202
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,280
talking about minutes and microseconds

203
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,620
and like this is actually not minutes in

204
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,359
microseconds it's like also in the

205
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,530
category of a very amount long amount of

206
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:28,580
time almost half a day now you're not

207
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:31,669
important I deny anybody 50 minutes a

208
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,169
year 50 minutes year or that if you look

209
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,020
at all of them you kind of go from like

210
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,419
four to five days down to like you know

211
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,579
hundreds of minutes down to 50 minutes

212
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,750
50 minutes anybody starting to feel

213
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,470
better it's about five minutes a month

214
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,730
do you think that there's any

215
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,140
discussions about five minutes a month

216
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:53,120
it depends on what site you're on

217
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:55,610
so my cute pet free animal calm probably

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,100
five minutes a month who cares

219
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,320
amazon.com five minutes and that

220
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,380
probably matters right we're probably

221
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,290
gonna be debating about why five minutes

222
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,220
and that could be millions of dollars so

223
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,810
what about the fact that we're all

224
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,630
striving for this when you look at the

225
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,229
LEDs now I'm showing all these numbers

226
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,370
right this is how developers talk

227
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,420
because I've been trained to talk that

228
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,939
way and they've been trained to talk

229
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,559
that way since the 1970s

230
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:24,319
and even before that I've been like

231
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,449
going back and looking and it turns out

232
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:28,969
that in like 1884 there were all these

233
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:31,128
papers on quality and over the years so

234
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,839
there's a really large amount of body of

235
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,699
work around this and it's an amazing

236
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,529
amount of work such that I guess people

237
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,508
really care about it and somewhere along

238
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:40,579
the lines security was actually it was

239
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:43,069
actually kind of positioned as safety

240
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:44,929
and those articles they started being

241
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:46,728
really interesting at first and then as

242
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:49,608
quality became a bigger driver and you

243
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:51,109
saw the age of computers that became

244
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,519
interesting too so I'm giving you a

245
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:54,019
history lesson on purpose because I'm

246
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,699
gonna actually reveal to you with some

247
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:57,289
interesting things that I think will

248
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:59,329
change your mind and also I'm going to

249
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:02,869
show you what we've learned about secure

250
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:04,368
ability so here's all the elytis I

251
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,109
didn't call it all 11 up there cuz they

252
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:09,139
made my slide look really yucky and well

253
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:12,470
I like pretty things so we're gonna go

254
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:15,470
with this and you notice like usability

255
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,029
availability portability scalability

256
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,409
extensibility all the LEDs right you're

257
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,639
starting to see the LEDs anything that

258
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,919
really it matters to a developer

259
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,769
apparently stick ility on the back of it

260
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:28,579
they love it teach them how to use it

261
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:31,579
they love it and that's great right so

262
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:35,689
availability how big is this problem for

263
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:39,319
the world anybody how many millions

264
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:42,889
billions zillions anybody huge massive

265
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:44,748
right it's about a 4.5 billion dollar

266
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:46,279
problem for the world according to one

267
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:49,220
study that I've been like looking for

268
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,629
and by the way and I have all the links

269
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,889
in here if you want if you're interested

270
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,749
in any other materials there's a whole

271
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:56,029
bunch of supplemental that I can provide

272
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:58,970
it's even got its own link so I'll send

273
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,979
it to if you're looking for it and 4.5

274
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,239
billion it's a big deal right it's a lot

275
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:04,069
of software down ty and that's a lot of

276
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:05,389
money lost I actually thought it was

277
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:08,269
gonna be much bigger I'm like wow people

278
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:10,399
yell about 4.5 billion dollar problem

279
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,989
okay that's a big deal but you know what

280
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,859
that's after there was all this work

281
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:18,619
done guess what if we were at 99% this

282
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:20,809
would be a really really bazillionaire

283
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:22,069
big problem and we might not even be

284
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,509
talking about the internet anymore

285
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:26,329
because maybe it just doesn't even exist

286
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:28,850
because how dare we be down four five

287
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:32,089
days a year right would you be really

288
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,470
upset if your if the machine that was

289
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:40,430
keeping you alive was down four

290
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:41,900
five five days a year anybody right you

291
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:48,109
might be dead right keeping you alive

292
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:52,310
right what about five minutes a year you

293
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,420
can maybe survive it maybe it depends on

294
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,479
if they're all the five minutes or at

295
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,640
the same time seconds might not matter

296
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,110
if it's a breathing machine what about a

297
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,640
heart machine right you starting to kind

298
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,220
of Gras quit but this is interesting

299
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,220
right and so I said all right what about

300
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,690
security how big is the security problem

301
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,690
anybody ever get yelled out of it

302
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,720
security developers get yelled out about

303
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,280
security interesting only when it breaks

304
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,590
are you sure that developers actually

305
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,220
get yelled at for that or do the

306
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:26,690
security people oh okay

307
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,160
they're fair yeah yeah okay cool awesome

308
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,480
I think it's starting to change I've

309
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,920
seen more developers yelled at for

310
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,020
security in the recent months and years

311
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,790
than I ever have now what's interesting

312
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,050
is this cat follows me around from

313
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,730
literally conference to conference

314
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,740
really pissed at me about like doing

315
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:46,190
this to security but I'm gonna do it

316
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,060
anyways secure ability I'm gonna do it

317
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,340
that's right

318
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,900
I stuck ility on the end of it I had to

319
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,060
look for like something to like bridge

320
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,840
it cuz it was secure ility and that just

321
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,000
didn't sound good

322
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,460
so I'm like well it's the ability to do

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,990
security or the ability to secure your

324
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,150
software right so essentially it's

325
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,740
secure ability so if you're gonna invent

326
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,390
a word you might as well invent another

327
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,860
word and then invent another one and

328
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,240
well that seems to be my thing so I'm

329
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,730
inventing yet another word and everybody

330
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,050
can hate me because how dare you but

331
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,730
when it comes down to it the concept

332
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,589
behind this is really about how do we

333
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,910
actually make things better so it's six

334
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:23,390
hundred billion dollars worth of a

335
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:27,110
problem whoa we're not yelling about it

336
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:31,310
enough it's a it's actually more than a

337
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:33,590
hundred X the other problem and somehow

338
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,810
we haven't spent enough time on it and

339
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,970
it hasn't gotten back into the LEDs and

340
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,719
we haven't looked at that 1970s paper

341
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,810
and said hey by the way did you

342
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,699
consider that there might be like

343
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,469
adversaries out there or people who

344
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,359
might care about making money off of

345
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,209
this it's a six hundred billion dollar

346
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,449
problem and I did get that number from

347
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,680
another study and so you know I'm not

348
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:58,120
gonna bother with all the numbers of

349
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,620
studies and things that I've been doing

350
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,870
but I will tell you and somewhere in the

351
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,339
2020 timeframe you're gonna see

352
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,660
something really cool from me and I'm

353
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:07,120
not even gonna spoil it yet but I'm

354
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,560
gonna just tell you I'm super excited

355
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,850
about numbers and I'm really excited

356
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,099
about all the trends that are going on

357
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,279
out there and the reason why is because

358
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,230
this group of people is becoming super

359
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,199
relevant in a way that I've never seen

360
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,649
before because we are actually

361
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:26,258
representing a new world of capability

362
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:28,120
that has to become mandated in companies

363
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:29,860
so that this problem gets smaller I

364
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,029
would love to say that instead of it

365
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,350
being a six hundred billion dollar

366
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,410
problem it's a six billion dollar

367
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,449
problem because we spent time on making

368
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,310
it an ility and we actually got people

369
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:42,040
to care about it and we could make it

370
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:44,949
relevant so here we go

371
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,509
climate change I decided to bring the

372
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:48,160
weather into this because why not or

373
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:49,269
climate change why not

374
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,649
because you know if you're gonna bring

375
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:51,279
up something relevant and do something

376
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,339
interesting

377
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,540
why does climate change matter to

378
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,430
security people

379
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,569
why does climate change matter to

380
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,430
developers why does climate change

381
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:02,290
matter to businesses what's interesting

382
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,120
is in the last few years

383
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,910
climate change actually matters for a

384
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,519
lot of reasons it's driving a lot more

385
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,379
theft and cyber security problems so

386
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,089
let's zoom in just on the last five

387
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,709
years and you'll notice there's no

388
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,110
purple squares and the purple squares

389
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,670
represent a little bit about security it

390
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,920
turns out that we're seeing more and

391
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,349
more global cyber security problems and

392
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,479
attacks related to the fact that by the

393
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,730
way when apparently a flood comes

394
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,009
there's actually opportunities like you

395
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,079
can see bad guys actually looking to get

396
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:34,779
money off of people who want to give

397
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,059
money to charity for reasons to help

398
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,769
right so you see all of this activity

399
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,439
you also see people being taken

400
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:44,470
advantage of and you also see hacking

401
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:46,540
happening at an unprecedent rying to

402
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,699
feed their families and I thought that

403
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,259
was really interesting because it told

404
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,878
me that some of the trends that I'm

405
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:54,220
and all of this data that I've been

406
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,259
pouring over for years

407
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,419
it's becoming even more relevant that

408
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:00,989
six hundred billion dollar problem will

409
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:03,220
probably double in the next few years

410
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:04,779
because it's not being controlled

411
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,119
because we're not going back to where we

412
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,889
lost the fight we're not going back to

413
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:10,209
the point at which we actually lost the

414
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,279
ability to build security and

415
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:14,319
effectively because we don't have the

416
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,049
ability to influence the masses at the

417
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,059
level we need to and what's interesting

418
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:22,929
about that is if you look across the

419
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:25,179
world it's epidemic you're seeing so

420
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:27,879
many different places in the world being

421
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:29,649
affected in this way and so how did I

422
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,569
bring it all back to this whole climate

423
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,549
change thing why is this even relevant

424
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,589
well it tells me that average series are

425
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:37,629
on the rise and even good people are

426
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,399
starting to find the ability to feed

427
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:42,369
their families in ways that we never

428
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,829
expected as an industry and that

429
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:47,679
motivation is changing the game in ways

430
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:50,138
that we don't expect what if it's not

431
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,299
just quality what if that it actually

432
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:56,730
matters in ways that we're really not

433
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:59,350
even talking about in the right way so

434
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,199
did you know that anybody can learn how

435
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,480
to hack now and in many cases we're

436
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:06,309
teaching them but how do you actually

437
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,760
secure something if you don't teach it

438
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:11,079
and so you have this really interesting

439
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,939
balancing act between we're actually

440
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,579
teaching a lot of people how to do

441
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:18,429
things against software that we need to

442
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:20,378
be able to justify to be able to bring

443
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,240
more headcount and talent did you hear

444
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:25,599
there's a million-person problem when it

445
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,579
comes to hiring into cybersecurity we

446
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,199
have to be training and yet we're also

447
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,168
fielding the other side of this equation

448
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,629
and so it's really interesting I put a

449
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,789
bunch of stuff up here they're amazing

450
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:39,100
articles I've taught some of the best

451
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:41,440
and brightest I've ever met in the

452
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,350
cybersecurity industry just by pointing

453
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,029
them out a few things on this list and

454
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,769
by the way this is not the only list

455
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:49,000
many of you if you're vendors you

456
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:51,820
actually have some of these lists too

457
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,169
and I could go on and on for all the

458
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,178
different resources that are out there

459
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:59,320
for people to learn how to do this it's

460
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:01,480
amazing wealth of capability so what

461
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,710
about the other opportunities people are

462
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,360
going out to the Internet

463
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,820
they're pulling in more and more

464
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,080
packages directly off the internet we're

465
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,658
actually building software at

466
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,000
unprecedented levels we're seeing scale

467
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:15,330
and speed and all these things right

468
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,100
well what's interesting about that is

469
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,689
how are we really getting ahead when it

470
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,418
comes to security and what are we doing

471
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,309
to measure it well the opportunities

472
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,190
become boundless you start to look at

473
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:28,990
more and more opportunities lots of

474
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,640
surveys we're seeing phishing at

475
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,409
unprecedented levels we're seeing

476
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,970
cryptocurrency mining all these

477
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:35,799
different things and they all play into

478
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,710
the fact that people are making mistakes

479
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,629
in how they build software not just in

480
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,010
the software itself but in how they put

481
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,320
it together and how they put business

482
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,750
logic together in how they bring all of

483
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,049
this to comb it to a rumination and and

484
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,480
all of a sudden the opportunities seem

485
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:54,279
mindlessly big a six hundred billion

486
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,529
dollar problem isn't that just what

487
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,360
we're hearing about maybe it's actually

488
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,940
bigger than we've anticipated maybe it's

489
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,729
bigger than the studies now I'm studying

490
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,830
5,000 companies right now and 350

491
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:09,130
billion dollars in security revenue and

492
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,960
what I'm finding is that there's so much

493
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,399
information out there that we're not

494
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,770
even seeing that we're not even

495
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:16,449
processing as security practitioners in

496
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,490
a way that helps us to understand that

497
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,909
that cross-site scripting vulnerability

498
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,950
isn't small it's absolutely massive it's

499
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:25,179
a big deal and we're not even talking

500
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:30,130
about it in the right ways

501
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:31,960
anybody use rasp you should be if you're

502
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,250
not go back to your company it's one of

503
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,580
those things you need to put in its eye

504
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,380
opening is absolutely amazing how much

505
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,178
your applications are being attacked and

506
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,909
they're being attacked in really

507
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,919
interesting ways I'm seeing more and

508
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:46,480
more capabilities by adversaries that

509
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,450
are learning how to do things and are

510
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,059
building tools and TTP's that are going

511
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,950
after what I call the rabbit hole of the

512
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,750
security world which is application

513
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,140
security when you look at everything

514
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:01,029
else you see sea bees for port 21 and

515
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,610
you see protocol problems and you see

516
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:07,919
all this stuff and when it comes down to

517
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:11,770
it what is amazing about our industry in

518
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,260
application security is that port 80 and

519
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,180
443 they're everywhere there are

520
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,120
ubiquitous

521
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,100
and by the way the problems are complex

522
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,979
if you look at the complexity that is

523
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,379
actually exploded since the internet

524
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,600
revolution we're seeing more and more

525
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,940
people have more opportunity to do bad

526
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,820
things because it's hidden in a couple

527
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,420
of ports and we don't have the right

528
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,520
tools to be able to help us to get the

529
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,890
instrumentation we need to be able to

530
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,389
make a difference as an application

531
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,860
security professional wouldn't you like

532
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,410
to know that the thing you just found

533
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,659
that you told somebody to fix is getting

534
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,460
attacked so that you could make it more

535
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,010
relevant for them because you want to

536
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,670
get them to fix it how many of your

537
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,710
things actually get fixed fast I can

538
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,150
tell you mine get fixed pretty fast and

539
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,100
the reason why is because I've got the

540
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,470
instrumentation and I go after it every

541
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,169
time I can't convince anybody without

542
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,240
that data I'm a data-driven person

543
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,940
everything I do is data related and so

544
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,860
this is what we're protecting we're

545
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,480
protecting not only where we live we're

546
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,360
protecting all the capabilities the

547
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,220
software that runs this and all of the

548
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,129
future opportunities that our children

549
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,290
have and when I look at that I'm like

550
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,170
the opportunities seem endless that we

551
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,879
spend all of our time on the opportunity

552
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,580
side of this and we don't look at the

553
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,010
root cause of all these things and so

554
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,899
Bri just really feel like this anybody

555
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,670
feel like their company could end up on

556
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,260
the Richter scale at any given time

557
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:44,970
remember I said that my my company my

558
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,940
pointy headed boss really really wants

559
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,890
me to solve for test coverage and I

560
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,140
bring it all the way back to what I said

561
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,210
earlier are you talking about doing

562
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,790
stock prediction because security has

563
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,680
always been surprising we aren't

564
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:01,710
actually getting ahead because we don't

565
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,270
have a few things that we need so you've

566
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,340
got to figure out how to bound your

567
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,050
decisions and what's interesting about a

568
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,149
test coverage plan and a test coverage

569
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,159
capability is that when you bounce

570
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,690
something you can be more effective at

571
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,090
it you can actually get ahead of it and

572
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,010
so apparently and I've done some

573
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,199
studying on this when you have unbounded

574
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:21,000
decisions you're almost not going to

575
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,680
make very much headway because there's

576
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,480
all these ethereal things that you have

577
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,160
to be thinking about but when you bound

578
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,940
a decision when you put it in a box and

579
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,740
you have boundaries

580
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,500
you can do something with it right

581
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,510
that's actually a really interesting

582
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,160
position because did you know that as an

583
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,720
application security professional your

584
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,790
job is to help people make better

585
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,740
decisions so you got to be able to put

586
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,720
all the right data into that box in the

587
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,410
right way so that they can actually do

588
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,760
something with it so we decided to do

589
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,320
this thing called the security hierarchy

590
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,570
of needs and yes I have been trolled in

591
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,370
any many ways and I've can tell you I

592
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,090
would love for somebody to come up with

593
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,449
something better

594
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,220
please I'll start talking about that but

595
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,190
for the time being we'll use mine just

596
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,470
for you know giggles encryption

597
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,030
authentication I didn't put I didn't put

598
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,010
authorization in authentication there's

599
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,420
a lot of reasons why but I'm sure I'm

600
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,770
gonna eventually add it there at some

601
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,960
point

602
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,970
logging asset management and zoning and

603
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,890
containment those are the five things

604
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,840
that when you bound them they make a

605
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,390
principle difference to your application

606
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,090
your systems your protocols your

607
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,800
business and so bounding them in a way

608
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,659
that actually brings this whole picture

609
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,200
together makes it so you can do things

610
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,280
like hey all those waspy things aren't

611
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,370
they just really input validation

612
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,050
problems where do those go and I've had

613
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,030
a bunch of debates about where they go

614
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,460
and it turns out that most of the stuff

615
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,440
is at the zoning and containment level

616
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,960
because if you actually protected it by

617
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,490
a firewall well it's not that available

618
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,470
it's only available internally there's

619
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,970
all sorts of reasons and rationale and

620
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,640
if you're interested in this model I've

621
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,140
done a talk on it at the CSA I'm in the

622
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,910
middle of writing bunch of papers about

623
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,060
all these things they're starting to get

624
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:02,610
published and I got to tell you finding

625
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:05,090
a way to bound decisions is the way that

626
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,679
allows us to participate and share

627
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,850
because what if you're having a zoning

628
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,200
and containment problem you're not

629
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,850
talking about the thing that just hits

630
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,010
you you're talking about a general

631
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,540
category about hey can you talk to me a

632
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,840
little bit about how you do zoning and

633
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,280
containment for some of your OS problems

634
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,810
that's a really different conversation

635
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,700
because there's a lot of different

636
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,919
techniques and tools and capabilities

637
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,070
that want map to this can make you more

638
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,690
successful so the other thing you have

639
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,530
to do for measurement requirements is

640
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,340
you have to actually go talk to

641
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,530
developers

642
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,090
turns out they care yeah

643
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,440
what's interesting and by the way I

644
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,549
actually started as a developer so I

645
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,080
kind of like have to have this fight

646
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:43,480
with myself internally and it's really

647
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,250
really brutal sometimes the side where

648
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,410
it wins and sometimes that side wins but

649
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,020
all the time I'm actually realizing that

650
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:52,210
most of the time I'm right so what's

651
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,830
interesting about that is you go and

652
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,410
talk to folks and it turns out that in

653
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,439
the intersection here the metric we want

654
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,330
to use has to be actionable

655
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,240
anybody got any metrics that are non

656
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:08,168
actionable I have 5,000 XYZ

657
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,309
vulnerabilities actual not actual can

658
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:10,480
you make a decision about that at the

659
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:11,740
highest level of your company or the

660
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,419
lowest level of your company probably

661
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:18,220
not common familiar simple I like the

662
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:20,500
simple one I realized a whole bunch of

663
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,299
stuff about simplicity really realizing

664
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,830
that it can actually change the world

665
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:29,770
and that last one durability super cool

666
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:32,770
so secure ability let me help you this

667
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:36,760
is kind of cool apparently when software

668
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:39,429
is actually a hundred percent secure you

669
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,030
can actually say it's resilient right so

670
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:45,700
one represents the simplicity of it's

671
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,830
either one or zero right well it turns

672
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,840
out that one of the biggest problems

673
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:52,960
that we have with software is its

674
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,299
exploit ability and what we found out by

675
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,980
studying it for a while is that exploit

676
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:58,600
ability is actually the biggest thing

677
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,240
that matters not the only thing that

678
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,309
matters but the biggest needle moving

679
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,790
problem that you have and everything

680
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:08,080
else is a subset of that problem and so

681
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,178
when you look at your exploitable

682
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,879
opportunities how many people actually

683
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,860
know all the assets that they have down

684
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,140
to the libraries that they have that run

685
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,409
in their application environment if you

686
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:24,309
can quote me a trillion ish number I

687
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,419
would believe you nobody not yet guess

688
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:27,370
what there's companies out there that

689
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:30,429
need to be born to solve that problem

690
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:32,979
for us because it's what we have to do

691
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:34,570
to bound this problem right you can't

692
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,890
predict the stock market if you don't

693
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,049
have all that instrumentation and

694
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,820
measure come in right and so when it

695
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:42,309
comes down to it exploit ability is the

696
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,750
biggest problem we have to solve how

697
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,760
many tickets do you put out to your

698
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,909
developers to fix why not just put the

699
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,279
ones out that really

700
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:50,359
right now and then explain to them that

701
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,029
these are the ones that are going to

702
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,889
matter later and if you Center it around

703
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:56,899
exploitability what's interesting is

704
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:58,488
people stopped fighting about it because

705
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:00,320
there is a realization that

706
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:03,099
exploitability is one of the most

707
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,960
important problems that we have to solve

708
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:07,428
so what's that breakdown into because

709
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,419
you know you put one word up there and

710
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:10,549
everybody wants to know what's

711
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:12,409
underneath it and oh by the way I've

712
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,330
been getting down that rabbit hole into

713
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:16,519
these things called resources now

714
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,889
apparently like different companies have

715
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,830
different names for what a resources you

716
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:23,748
might heard component entity there's no

717
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,849
standard out there apparently for

718
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:28,759
figuring out what a resource is that we

719
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:31,340
want to test so the first problem is can

720
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,409
we all just like agree on some word like

721
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,199
I I think that's the first problem what

722
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:37,759
is it is it a resource is it a URL like

723
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,679
what is it what are we gonna go after

724
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,139
right so what's interesting is

725
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,639
exploitable targets total exploitable

726
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:46,158
opportunities what is the total

727
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:48,139
exploitable opportunity it means that

728
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,629
you have to know what your resources are

729
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:52,609
and where all the exploitability is and

730
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:55,099
those resources and then you have to go

731
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:57,649
after it so the stuff that you guys do

732
00:27:55,099 --> 00:28:00,259
if you're a pen tester is you're

733
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:02,478
actually popping the stack essentially

734
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:05,299
you're actually going after and getting

735
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:07,789
that exploited target to come up you got

736
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:09,649
a ticket you have a document whatever it

737
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:11,359
is that you're pointing out that is the

738
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:13,668
thing that's actually some of the most

739
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,739
valuable here now I've never met a

740
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:18,889
company that didn't have an exploitable

741
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:21,049
opportunity out there because people

742
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:23,178
actually go into that category too and

743
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:24,619
there's a whole bunch of other resources

744
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,210
that are out there and like I said you

745
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:29,840
have to describe this in the right way

746
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:32,239
so how do you get the five nines and

747
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,009
security did you know that most of the

748
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:35,779
industry right now is it like ninety

749
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:37,639
nine point eight if you're doing it

750
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:40,940
really well and I would question who's

751
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:42,949
doing it really well like my gauge on

752
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,019
that is when you look at some of the

753
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,450
stuff that's out by Symantec they talked

754
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:49,190
about this email study that they did and

755
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,769
apparently one in five hundred and

756
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:54,619
thirty one emails has something bad in

757
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:56,419
it or is attractive in a bad way or has

758
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:58,668
some sort of attachment that's actually

759
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:00,830
a bad attachment one of the five hundred

760
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:03,919
thirty one actually equates to ninety

761
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,720
point eight six which is interesting

762
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,269
because we get back to it it's really

763
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,710
only two nines I remember I told you at

764
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:11,929
the very beginning that that's like five

765
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,299
days now I'm gonna say eighty six is

766
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,190
actually better than not having the 86

767
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:20,658
there so we're not gonna get there but

768
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:23,600
it's not 99.99 right and it's not ninety

769
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:25,429
nine point nine it's actually ninety

770
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,779
nine point eight six that's kind of

771
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:28,220
scary that means that we're actually

772
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:30,039
suffering in ways that we don't even

773
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:34,010
realize and having contemplated and

774
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,750
somehow it's good enough but we're

775
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,649
missing six hundred billion dollars in

776
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,120
opportunity in the security industry so

777
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:44,209
how do you break that down how do you

778
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,189
get there two things that guy was right

779
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:48,289
test coverage matters and we're gonna

780
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,360
have to go after it but apparently

781
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:52,279
resource coverage matters too you're

782
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,469
starting to see new companies popping up

783
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:56,480
around resources right they're

784
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,220
interesting they're starting to tell us

785
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,690
that we don't know what we have and we

786
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,029
can't test everything if we don't know

787
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,740
what we have so we better spend some

788
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:06,740
effort and some time and some money on

789
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,720
that problem as a tester I can tell you

790
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,820
knowing what I have to test is part of

791
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,799
the battle and then figuring out what

792
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,740
tests I have to apply to it also part of

793
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,840
the battle and this is the area of the

794
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,659
industry that has kind of been left to

795
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,610
the wasteland we aren't doing it yet we

796
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:24,620
need to be doing it and it has to become

797
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,908
the thing that we focus on so what does

798
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,918
that look like what does resource

799
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:30,110
coverage look like you gotta find it

800
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:35,809
you got a catalog it and you gotta track

801
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:37,010
it so who who has a CMDB who has a CMDB

802
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:38,510
that has everything in it yeah I know

803
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,649
some people like in the application

804
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,870
security community we're kind of like

805
00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:43,070
cynical and by the way cmdbs

806
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,139
if you've ever gone in there you're like

807
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,519
it's not really a thing and it doesn't

808
00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:48,559
really help me because when you go in

809
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,330
there you find out like hey this product

810
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,730
isn't actually the right product I went

811
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:54,980
to that URL it wasn't actually there it

812
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,139
was actually this other thing and most

813
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,789
of the time what I find is that since I

814
00:30:57,139 --> 00:31:00,709
worked on a CMDB at one point in my

815
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:03,710
career and oh my god thank God I got out

816
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,080
of that I realized that along the way we

817
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,299
actually find out that most cmdbs don't

818
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,340
actually hit the sweet spot for a

819
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:12,379
security professional and they're not

820
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,480
right and they don't provide us that

821
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,970
capability for passing in and finding

822
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,860
the things that need to be found and the

823
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,540
other thing that you have to do is you

824
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,399
have to have test coverage you got to

825
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,200
have a frame for test coverage which is

826
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,690
why we went after security hierarchy of

827
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,540
needs it's one of the reasons that we

828
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,910
actually are doing OK at mapping things

829
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,980
we're also looking to advance our

830
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,840
capabilities so once you get in there

831
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,100
you're going to find all your CVS you're

832
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,610
gonna find all your techniques the

833
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,590
olaf's

834
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,270
group provides a tremendous amount of

835
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,639
detail and information you're gonna

836
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:46,310
catalog that puppy and then you're gonna

837
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,450
be like alright so I tested all of that

838
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:51,470
stuff and guess what your jobs not done

839
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,080
your job is to figure out how to

840
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,840
weaponize and there's a part of actually

841
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,610
bringing test coverage to life which is

842
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,939
not just running all of these scanners

843
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:03,350
and capabilities out there but actually

844
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:06,740
zoning in on what makes your company

845
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,510
different we can't buy scanners that are

846
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,150
actually going to help us to make them

847
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,129
relevant to our specific companies we

848
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,780
have to actually do things to be able to

849
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,450
advance our understanding of the test

850
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,100
coverage problems that we each have

851
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,140
individually and that is a bigger deal

852
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,360
right so apparently we should be sharing

853
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,310
because my test coverage in your test

854
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,469
coverage and your test coverage they are

855
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,929
all going to be different test coverages

856
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:32,120
but what if we could actually make it

857
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:34,730
easier on each other by sharing the test

858
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,649
that we're going to be advancing what if

859
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,890
every single person in the room should

860
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:43,370
have to register a CBE we did eight last

861
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:47,270
year in a group that never had done any

862
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:50,659
before we did eight we're gonna try and

863
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,100
triple that number this year and we're

864
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,420
starting to get more skills and we're

865
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,459
finding more capabilities and we're

866
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,650
finding more tools and more partners and

867
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:01,550
more design partners to go after this

868
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:04,100
problem so what's it all boiled down to

869
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,409
why do you care why are you listening to

870
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,860
me today well it turns out that if you

871
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:12,230
have a p1 p0 r p0 incident you're gonna

872
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,320
get pawned you'd better clean it up now

873
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:17,240
right that's the equation if you want to

874
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,060
stop fighting with people and make it so

875
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,460
something's relevant for them a p0 is

876
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,820
probably already zero you've got a

877
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,950
priority it's today

878
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,658
it's already something available for an

879
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,029
adversary or it is being attacked by an

880
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,440
adversary and it's that relevant that

881
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,840
that thing that's gonna crush you is

882
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,820
actually that important so when you

883
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,570
measure it you're gonna figure out oh

884
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:41,939
well this is really a big deal so how

885
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,989
does it all like play out and what about

886
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,389
your five nines

887
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:47,580
so most of the time it's you know you

888
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:50,428
might find one thing here and there

889
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,899
hopefully and by the way if you're

890
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:53,639
finding more than one thing you should

891
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,350
like work on that because that means

892
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,168
that you've got lots of opportunity

893
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,488
right but let's just say that in one

894
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,909
resource and I'm going to talk about

895
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:04,769
like the smallest resource probable

896
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:07,440
let's just say we have a 3,000 line

897
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:09,179
component out there and we find a

898
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,270
problem but it turns out we find a

899
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:15,000
problem and actually there were five

900
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:17,280
possible opportunities right we all talk

901
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,619
about probability and likelihood anybody

902
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,169
like to use risk equations impact and

903
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,530
likelihood yeah and I'm not there

904
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:24,239
anymore

905
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,730
I actually just really focus on

906
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,250
likelihood if I can break it it probably

907
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:34,260
should get fixed because the impact of

908
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:36,030
it is uncalculated to the algorithm when

909
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,790
you really get down to risk and

910
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,679
quantification it used to work because

911
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,119
it was a small number of things and so

912
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,109
when you did the risk calculation it

913
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,899
made a lot of sense but now with

914
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:47,969
complexity factors in play it's really

915
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:49,500
likelihood so if if I can pawn your

916
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:51,149
stuff as an application security

917
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,040
professional and I can convince you as a

918
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:57,058
developer to fix it does it really

919
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,308
matter if it was a billion dollar

920
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:00,960
problem or a ten thousand dollar problem

921
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:03,089
because if somebody gets into my

922
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,980
application and potentially they can do

923
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:06,690
a bunch of other things with it then

924
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,020
really ultimately all I got to do is

925
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,579
convince people to fix things and then

926
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,829
so how do you calculate exploitability

927
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:16,280
from that so we're gonna take that one

928
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:23,069
we're gonna we're gonna divide by five

929
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:26,609
point to anybody scared turns out if you

930
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:29,520
do the magical equation you're at eighty

931
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:32,420
percent secure ability for that

932
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:38,600
component part of three thousand lines

933
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:42,110
what a developer get fired where's your

934
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:44,509
threshold and that's an important

935
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,530
element right our businesses have to get

936
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,110
to the point where we're actually

937
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,120
talking about these things is five-nines

938
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,370
what we want for secure ability I don't

939
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,740
know but at least I'm starting the

940
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,509
conversation and it is uncomfortable and

941
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:01,729
the reason it is uncomfortable is that

942
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:04,040
80 percent is a lot of problem and if

943
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,560
you let that just sit for how long will

944
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,230
you let that sit so if you trend this

945
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,610
over time your software stays at 80

946
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,440
percent is that something you want to

947
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:15,550
buy what if the car you buy had 80

948
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,350
percent secure ability anybody ready

949
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:21,080
yeah no I probably not actually get

950
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:24,080
bought by you these are interesting and

951
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,850
unique arguments but I believe that

952
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,740
there are the relevant ones that we have

953
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:31,040
to be having when it comes to security

954
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:33,109
and when you change it to no nines right

955
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,790
and people could get fired for this

956
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,020
they're not going to fire for being all

957
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,520
the Wall Street Journal they're getting

958
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,570
fired because they don't understand how

959
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,940
to do the things they need to be doing

960
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,770
and we need to figure out how to teach

961
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,240
them to do those things so that they can

962
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,590
take responsibility but by the way when

963
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,979
you put that number in front of somebody

964
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:51,020
who doesn't understand security it

965
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,430
actually gets really easy because what

966
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,009
we're talking about is exploitability

967
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,250
don't let exploitability happen when

968
00:36:55,010 --> 00:37:00,530
you're looking at this kind of chart for

969
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,050
your company right and you're actually

970
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:06,590
talking about hate how are our 9s doing

971
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:11,570
right now when you're at this level it

972
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:13,430
becomes i opening and it's amazing when

973
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,590
you start to see that secure ability can

974
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,390
be an effective measure these are the

975
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,800
bars become all the things that you

976
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,240
could have that we're exploitable

977
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,030
opportunities and in this case I feel

978
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,459
bad for this company this is not my

979
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,810
company thank God but this is a company

980
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,130
that I was studying and they were

981
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,600
challenged by the fact that they were

982
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,070
seeing more and more exploitable

983
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,270
opportunity it turns out that they

984
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,340
actually had a firewall that was

985
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,890
misconfigured Wow

986
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,630
right that was easy to find because nmap

987
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,779
this little tiny tool actually helped

988
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:43,340
you find it so amazing stuff right why

989
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,600
does this matter again to a developer

990
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,340
though I'm gonna leave you with one

991
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,920
interest

992
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:50,200
and the reason why developers will

993
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,150
really love this because if they focus

994
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:56,350
on fixing exploitability and you wanted

995
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:58,600
to shift left shifting left looking at

996
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,650
that 1970s paper and getting to the

997
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,750
point where you're really having a

998
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,290
conversation with a developer is all

999
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:06,940
about saving their regression period and

1000
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,560
if you want to get to the point where

1001
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,810
you're a saving a regression period

1002
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,540
you're going to go through this process

1003
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,759
with ninety-nine point nine and realize

1004
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,500
that you can even predict ninety nine

1005
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,170
point nine because you can predict what

1006
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,300
an exploitable opportunity is and I

1007
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,670
believe that it we're kind of onto

1008
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,230
something because when you sit down to

1009
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,790
really look at how you're doing if

1010
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,080
you've got a team of people and you've

1011
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,670
got the right scanners and the right

1012
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,940
vendors and the right people in the mix

1013
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:37,630
to software make a software harder and

1014
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:39,340
more resilient to attackers you actually

1015
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,050
get to the point where we can actually

1016
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:45,010
take that six hundred billion dollar

1017
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:47,230
problem and turn it into a six billion

1018
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,910
dollar problem and potentially even less

1019
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,790
because we're focused on it in the right

1020
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:54,069
way so your tolerance level so if you

1021
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,170
look at it your exploit ability is your

1022
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:58,780
tolerance can be anything for your

1023
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:01,090
company in some companies I've actually

1024
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,940
heard the third split ability threshold

1025
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,770
is pretty high they worry about it when

1026
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,690
on the other side when they're going to

1027
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,270
basically block all of the activities

1028
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,850
and actions through chasing lateral

1029
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,650
movement so their strategy might be hey

1030
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,089
we're good up until this point and then

1031
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,730
we can't actually chase the bad guys out

1032
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,170
of our systems fast enough but the

1033
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,580
conversation becomes different right

1034
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,060
because you're actually now talking

1035
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:27,759
about what can we tolerate what can we

1036
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,009
sustain with how are we fighting against

1037
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,500
adversaries and the number change is

1038
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,940
magical because

1039
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,160
executives understand it's are already

1040
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,590
dealing with availability so going to

1041
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,470
something that has five nines can help

1042
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:43,000
now we're always looking at like the

1043
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:46,569
five nines to try and figure out like

1044
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,540
what is 0.9 really mean to us what is

1045
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:51,400
0.99 really mean to us and we've been

1046
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,560
studying a lot on this but what we've

1047
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,260
effectively found is that by measuring

1048
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,810
exploitability into it really developers

1049
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,730
now own it when you publish to a sea ice

1050
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:03,310
the process and an exploitable

1051
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,450
opportunity comes through they don't

1052
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:06,310
want to go on the other side of that

1053
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,049
equation because they run into my team

1054
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,110
who's gonna basically exploit the

1055
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,820
opportunity and we've been building play

1056
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,460
books and all sorts of things against

1057
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,290
those capabilities and you know as I've

1058
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,450
looked at all the data there's data that

1059
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:21,580
matters to us but when you look at it

1060
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,859
it's really hard to look at until you

1061
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,890
get a framework that helps you to put it

1062
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,570
into perspective some vulnerabilities

1063
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,100
are never going to get weaponized and

1064
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:33,850
we're spending a tremendous amount of

1065
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,920
time fixing a lot of stuff but in the

1066
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:38,350
wrong places like why wouldn't I want my

1067
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,990
developer to go fix vulnerabilities in

1068
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:43,000
the regression period I think that's

1069
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,379
where they need to be fixed so don't let

1070
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,150
your stuff come out without patches

1071
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,130
don't let your stuff come out but you

1072
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,560
should run those vulnerability scanners

1073
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,560
you should provide me with some data and

1074
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,480
make it so that I can go decide whether

1075
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,279
I can exploit them or not or weaponize

1076
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,780
against them you know one of the things

1077
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,550
that we're working on is weaponizing

1078
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,590
against things that are out there so

1079
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:05,050
that we can actually exploit them before

1080
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,420
somebody bad does it a zero-day is

1081
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,830
commonly just somebody exploiting

1082
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,110
something that's already been known for

1083
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:13,000
a long time

1084
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:14,890
well when it comes down to it I think

1085
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,170
that we're talking about the fact that

1086
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:19,900
you matured over time people didn't fire

1087
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,720
their developers along the way when it

1088
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,610
was availability challenges and the

1089
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,680
question was really hey does this help

1090
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:29,170
the equation to be able to fire somebody

1091
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,960
for bad secure ability it's a way of

1092
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,430
describing it I think that the honest

1093
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,350
truth is we're gonna have to work

1094
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,390
through it as an industry and it's gonna

1095
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:39,490
take some time before we're gonna have

1096
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,839
the tools capabilities and all the

1097
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,649
things that we're gonna need to make

1098
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,930
that come to life

1099
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,880
and so I don't know that anybody's gonna

1100
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,390
get fired for security problems right

1101
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,370
now

1102
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:50,980
but in the future when we get really

1103
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:53,380
good at it maybe they should be but I'm

1104
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,800
actually saying that the equation should

1105
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:59,230
be that you're solving for all of those

1106
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,270
problems earlier on and I think that

1107
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,490
they that having a number when you're

1108
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,500
talking to management that helps to make

1109
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,970
these things come together makes it so

1110
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,150
you can have the dialogue in a different

1111
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,669
way so at that point the conversation is

1112
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,890
a man

1113
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,020
is looking at an actual number you're

1114
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,549
looking at the number two and there's no

1115
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,190
hiding it anymore there's no subjective

1116
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:20,510
opinion there's just a number that

1117
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,600
you're moving and you're making

1118
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,640
decisions about so it may not be the

1119
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,560
answer and I love contrarians because

1120
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,529
it's amazing to have the conversation so

1121
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,940
I love contrarian thought process and I

1122
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,620
think I learned a tremendous amount from

1123
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,750
people that are really pushing to make

1124
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,240
things like this resilient and I invited

1125
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:40,340
because we're not telling you this is

1126
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,589
the answer we're telling you it's the

1127
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,930
beginning of a conversation for sure and

1128
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:46,400
I don't know that I have every answer

1129
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,080
but I can tell you I've spent a couple

1130
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,170
of years chasing that pointy-headed

1131
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,450
bosses perspective and I think he's kind

1132
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,920
of right because and at the first part

1133
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:59,180
of it I was like he was I thought he was

1134
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,710
mad but now I actually know that some of

1135
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,529
the things that are left out there from

1136
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:05,180
a security industry perspective need to

1137
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,740
be solved towards the end of your

1138
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,299
conversation you talked about not all

1139
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,950
risks are created equal that's right

1140
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,630
maybe not a vulnerability so does your

1141
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:14,089
mathematical model actually factor in

1142
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:17,150
cbss scoring or something else - yeah

1143
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:19,460
that relative risk yeah so we use the

1144
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,390
security hierarchy of needs the question

1145
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,130
I think I don't know if these

1146
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,200
microphones are working the question was

1147
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:28,310
really does my math the mathematical

1148
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:33,439
model actually solve for bringing it all

1149
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:37,220
together what was it again the relative

1150
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,230
level of risk yeah so so you have a CVE

1151
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,149
scored vulnerability how do you fit it

1152
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,340
into this model what we realized was

1153
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,390
there that all cv vulnerabilities are

1154
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,460
not created equal

1155
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,319
so that's the first equate part of the

1156
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,630
equation then we realized that if you

1157
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,560
use the security hierarchy of needs that

1158
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,270
you're actually going to be talking

1159
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,529
about zoning and containment problems

1160
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:56,720
when you're looking at a hierarchy of

1161
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,610
needs model those are usually more

1162
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,770
important and the ones that actually bad

1163
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:03,440
guys go after so the model it does

1164
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,940
actually solve for pulling that risk

1165
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,250
equation together but in a different way

1166
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,470
and the reason why is because when you

1167
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,470
look at like logs and Instrumentation

1168
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:14,240
data if you leave those in the equation

1169
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,480
from a security operations perspective

1170
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,919
they blur a lot of different things and

1171
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,019
the attacks that are happening on these

1172
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,149
other parts of the equation they

1173
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:25,008
get blurred out so if you put logging

1174
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:27,828
and evasion and all the other problems

1175
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:29,479
together in their own bucket all the

1176
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:31,519
rest of them kind of show up in a

1177
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:34,158
different way and you can test more

1178
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:37,218
effectively and more efficiently so your

1179
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,419
exploit opportunity goes way down when

1180
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:41,209
you're actually controlling it that way

1181
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:43,419
and your percentage for false positives

1182
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:45,379
goes way down your false negatives

1183
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:47,359
actually go away too

1184
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,679
because you're able to now look at the

1185
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,449
dimensions of the problems that you're

1186
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:54,769
dealing with and you're able to research

1187
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:59,359
in a different way one more question

1188
00:44:54,769 --> 00:45:01,709
any all right I'm outside if you guys

1189
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:07,808
want to talk thank you

1190
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:07,809
[Applause]

1191
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,720
you
