2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,489
I'm gonna go through my presentation I

3
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,710
left time at the end for questions and I

4
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,850
hope we can have kind of an interesting

5
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,940
conversation we live in interesting

6
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,500
times when it comes to face recognition

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,660
technology but before you can really

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,610
talk about how computers see faces and

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,559
recognize faces you have to take kind of

10
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,230
a step backwards and think for a minute

11
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,180
about human face recognition how do we

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,349
see because it's actually an amazing

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,129
thing that I don't think people

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,019
appreciate enough when a baby is in the

15
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,479
womb their eyes form their eyes are

16
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,950
closed while the retinas being formed

17
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,990
but as soon as the retina is done they

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,180
will start blinking and if mom goes out

19
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,679
into really bright sunlight some of it

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,810
can actually go through her stomach and

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,940
the baby will start to practice seeing

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,560
but it's not really until they're born

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,020
and open their eyes for the first time

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,140
that they see and they can see which is

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,960
amazing to me so this is what we think

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,119
babies can see at birth they don't they

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,199
can't focus they can only see about 12

28
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,360
inches away they don't have color vision

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,000
yet it takes about six more months for

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,640
their vision to be fully developed but

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,429
at Birth a baby will prefer face shapes

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,429
to non shape faces so we already have an

33
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:46,500
innate preference for people and by

34
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:48,509
three months they're starting to develop

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,979
color vision they can start to see red

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,569
that's the first color that comes out

37
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,580
followed by the others they can

38
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,250
recognize their primary caregiver as

39
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,959
well as an adult can recognize a person

40
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,630
that they know well I mean that's

41
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,240
amazing but it also kind of makes sense

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,740
because we live with other people we

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,660
live in groups and so being able to

44
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,728
recognize your primary caregiver and the

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:13,650
people who you're with is really really

46
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,720
important our brains are and most people

47
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,130
think that you see with your eyes you

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,890
actually see with your brain your eyes

49
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,540
are the sensors that pull data in but

50
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,519
you spend about 30% of your brain

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,160
processing vision and all of that data

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,380
compared to about 3% for hearing so it's

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,299
a process that's going on it's really

54
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,030
complicated it's really complex it takes

55
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,920
up a lot of time and processor no clock

56
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,210
speeds we are so good at finding

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,859
patterns and

58
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,420
specifically faces there's actually a

59
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,880
specific part of the brain called the

60
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,260
fusiform gyrus that is dedicated to

61
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,240
looking for patterns and looking at

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,290
faces we're so good at it that we see

63
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,600
them when they're not there

64
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,400
this is pareidolia people used to think

65
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,410
it was a sign of mental illness it's

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,240
just your brain being so good at finding

67
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,120
patterns and faces that it finds them

68
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,100
even when they're not there on the flip

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,980
side you can also have a condition

70
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,660
called face blindness it's very rare and

71
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,100
it's usually caused by some kind of a

72
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,049
head injury but there are some people

73
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,030
who absolutely cannot recognize people

74
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,160
they just do not have the ability to

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,020
make that connection and see the pattern

76
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,549
and if you think about when you see a

77
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,230
person you know and you recognize them

78
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,610
it's really hard to understand how you

79
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,780
do that I'm gonna describe it to

80
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,590
somebody else how do you know that

81
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,390
person you just kind of do and to me

82
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,760
it's just an amazing thing that we're

83
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,250
able to do and here's one last example

84
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,530
of what I think is just amazing this is

85
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,830
an image that you can see that

86
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,330
represents a concept from entertainment

87
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,820
it's a TV show that's been on the air

88
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,260
for a very long time and most people if

89
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,450
they they give it a little bit of time

90
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,470
will figure out what this represents has

91
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,649
anyone figured it out

92
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:50,730
okay we've got a bunch of people so it's

93
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,070
this it's the Simpsons but think about

94
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,859
this your brain was able to get the

95
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,260
Simpsons out of I think eight colors and

96
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,090
15 pixels I mean clearly that wasn't

97
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,549
there your brain made that up and

98
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,280
figured it out and computers can never

99
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,900
do that our ability to see is amazing we

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,770
see in context and we see with the

101
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,930
history of all of our past experiences

102
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,910
one last thing it's almost mean to bring

103
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,850
this up your nose is in the middle of

104
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,459
your face you can always see it it is

105
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,100
visible to both of your eyes 100% of the

106
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,440
time when your eyes are open and yet

107
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,060
unless you try to focus on it you

108
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
probably don't notice it that's because

109
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,630
your brain filters it out except now I

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
bet you see it

111
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,969
the other thing I think is really

112
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,980
interesting is because of the way the

113
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,420
retina is formed there's actually a hole

114
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,970
where the optic nerve goes through the

115
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,220
brain and so you have two big splotches

116
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,050
in the middle just off to the side of

117
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,780
your field of view where there's a blind

118
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,580
spot you absolutely cannot see and yet

119
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,559
you think you can see everything that's

120
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,080
because your brain is making stuff up

121
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,140
and putting it in that gap and you can

122
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,180
go online and Google you know blind spot

123
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,070
test and get some things to see it it's

124
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,540
really kind of freaky to think wow I'm

125
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,130
seeing things that aren't there I

126
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,710
literally cannot see that my brain is

127
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,430
making it up for me there's also an

128
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,349
online test for signai sure some people

129
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,240
are really bad at recognizing faces it's

130
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,100
just like most human skills there's a

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,800
bell curve some people aren't very good

132
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,630
at it some people are really really good

133
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,010
at it they're called super recognizers

134
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,870
and there's an online test you can take

135
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,340
to see if you're one of them and there's

136
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,620
a couple of jobs that pay really well

137
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,349
that are only for super recognizer so

138
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,750
it's worth checking out so we're talking

139
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,390
about really face recognition technology

140
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,979
and human face recognition and the thing

141
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,110
I kind of want to point out is it's not

142
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,360
a hundred percent and it never will be

143
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,880
human face recognition isn't a hundred

144
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,160
percent here we have two celebrities who

145
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,409
often get mistaken for each other not

146
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,080
the same person on the other side way of

147
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,669
identical twins who frequently get

148
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,070
mistaken for each other not the same

149
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,570
person we've all had the experience of

150
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,040
walking up to somebody and starting to

151
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,169
talk to them to go oh I'm sorry I

152
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,729
thought you're someone else or what's

153
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:03,109
worse and what happens to me a lot if

154
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:05,090
somebody comes up and starts talking to

155
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,590
you and you're thinking oh god I'm so I

156
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,780
should know this person who is this

157
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,789
person well it'll come to me and maybe

158
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,229
you get it maybe you don't but it's not

159
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,910
something that's a hundred percent and

160
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,010
we kind of want it to be but it's just

161
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,330
not human face recognition isn't a

162
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,659
hundred percent and neither it is that

163
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,310
for machines so the core concept for

164
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,860
face recognition technology is we want

165
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,169
to know if I have a face who is it I

166
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,110
mean it's it's kind of a useful question

167
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,520
and something has a lot of applications

168
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,150
but it's actually a very complicated

169
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,130
sort of brute-force process any kind of

170
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,900
classification system has two steps you

171
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,000
have to enroll an image

172
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,888
it into the database and so you would

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,009
take a picture this is a picture taken

174
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:49,460
with the cell phone it's 1.9 megabytes

175
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:51,320
pretty big relatively and that goes into

176
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,120
the database with name attribute

177
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,039
whatever else you have and then you'll

178
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,660
give a probe image that'll go to the

179
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,699
gallery and be compared to say is this

180
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,320
that person but one of the things that

181
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:01,340
we do with enrollment images is we

182
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,800
convert them to something called

183
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,479
templates templates just a long string

184
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,729
of complicated numbers that uniquely

185
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,530
represents that person but in our case

186
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:12,680
I'm in our system the templates about

187
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,299
400 bytes much much smaller and the key

188
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,979
thing about templates is a template can

189
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,350
never go back to a photograph or an

190
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,570
identity it's always just an encrypted

191
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,310
number and that's a security feature it

192
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,050
also helps things go faster because if

193
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,949
we had to deal with two megabyte images

194
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,210
we'd never get anything done

195
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,400
after you've enrolled somebody and you

196
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,049
actually want to find them you send the

197
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,969
probe image and it looks the database

198
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,849
the first thing it has to do is find the

199
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,680
face in it a brute force you know high

200
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:41,240
computational system they're scanning

201
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,699
and they're looking for something that

202
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,320
vaguely is face shaped once they find a

203
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,849
face they'll start comparing they turn

204
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,210
that into a template compare them to

205
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:52,430
find the match there's two different

206
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,020
kinds of things that we do that we call

207
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,220
a face recognition and they're they're

208
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,349
different in ways that are kind of

209
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,150
important one-to-one met one-to-one

210
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:00,889
matching or verification you're probably

211
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,599
familiar with if you have an iPhone you

212
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:05,060
take the phone you take a picture you

213
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,320
say I am Mary this is Mary's phone now

214
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,180
if I want to unlock my phone

215
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,610
it takes one more picture and it

216
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,409
verifies that this picture matches the

217
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,440
one on the phone one-to-one matching

218
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:17,539
it's relatively simple if I want to do

219
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,479
identification which is here's a picture

220
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:23,000
who is this especially if you have a

221
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
large gallery a record database with a

222
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,530
million records it's computationally a

223
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,960
much more difficult prospect and it's

224
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,669
much harder to get right I don't think

225
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,610
people appreciate sometimes that those

226
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,468
two things are very very different so

227
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,490
let's talk about errors and biometrics I

228
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,589
already said it's not a hundred percent

229
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,630
we kind of like it to be you know I take

230
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:42,860
a test I can look at an answer they can

231
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,810
say you got it right or you got it wrong

232
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,760
but if I look at a person and I say

233
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,300
that's Bob there's always a little bit

234
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,420
of a doubt because identity is

235
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,310
ballistic so there's two kinds of errors

236
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,170
the first one generally there's a couple

237
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,119
of different names for it I'm most

238
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,469
comfortable with a false non match two

239
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
people are the same person

240
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,690
the system has incorrectly said this is

241
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,570
not a match it is a false non match the

242
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,400
other kind of error is a false match two

243
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,810
different people the system incorrectly

244
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,180
says they're the same person

245
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,910
now most of these technologies have

246
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,079
their roots in law-enforcement

247
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:19,439
applications actually in fingerprint

248
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,180
sensor back in the 60s when you needed

249
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,170
to go find out if somebody was in a

250
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,560
criminal database

251
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,910
they had warehouse size rooms with rows

252
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,920
and rows of filing cabinets full of

253
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,810
fingerprint cards on paper where

254
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,430
somebody had been inked and printed and

255
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,989
they had what was called the Henry

256
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,060
classification system where each

257
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,130
fingerprint had five different types and

258
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,630
there are other ways to classify it so

259
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,160
you would look at the latent print very

260
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,140
carefully trained for it forensic

261
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,760
examiners and they could immediately

262
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,230
figure out the classification type so

263
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,270
that was one in five who don't have to

264
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,070
look at the four-fifths of the filing

265
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,420
cabinets that for the other types there

266
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,650
are some other things to reduce the

267
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,290
problem set but then they would

268
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,180
literally sit down drawer by drawer card

269
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,490
by card manually compare the latent

270
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,829
print to this card nope go on to the

271
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,660
next one it could take months to find a

272
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,660
match and so they started looking for

273
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,550
systems that could do this and because

274
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,959
they didn't really trust machines and

275
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,839
because they didn't really want machines

276
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,400
to make matches they designed them so

277
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,740
that the computer really doesn't do the

278
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,240
matching it culled through the data set

279
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,920
eliminating things that absolutely

280
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,990
cannot be matches and then they're

281
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,150
designed to give the best twenty

282
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,220
candidate to a human examiner who will

283
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,750
sit down and review them even if there's

284
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,570
nothing in the database that's remotely

285
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,970
close it will find the best 20 and put

286
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,990
them in there but how do you know if

287
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,600
it's a match or not

288
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,040
so you have to set a threshold and again

289
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,980
this is all probabilistic and

290
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,750
conditional probability so at some point

291
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,820
above which we think okay these two

292
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,320
scores are so similar it's a match if

293
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,850
they're so far apart we're absolutely

294
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,740
certain it's not a

295
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,560
- this is a complicated area that I'm

296
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,660
kind of simplifying but remember you

297
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,550
have these two kinds of errors they're

298
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,500
inversely proportional so I can actually

299
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,810
tune my system I can tune my algorithm

300
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,860
to favor one or the other so you might

301
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,599
think that you would set your threshold

302
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,330
right in the middle where they you get

303
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,030
the lowest of both kinds of errors but

304
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,310
in practice that rarely happens so for

305
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,560
example in law enforcement they're very

306
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,420
very concerned about missing a match if

307
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,520
there's a possible match they want a

308
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,800
human to review it and so they tune them

309
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,210
so they see every possible match and

310
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,099
that means they get a lot of false

311
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,840
matches a lot of things they have to

312
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,870
look at that it probably could never be

313
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,330
a match just on the flipside a lot of

314
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,860
theme parks Disney Universal Studios a

315
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,900
lot of these large places they use

316
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,120
biometrics for their season pass holders

317
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,579
so they can just walk in and have a nice

318
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,490
experience they do just the exact

319
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,140
opposite because the odds that somebody

320
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,910
is going to go into the line that's

321
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,920
specifically for season pass holders

322
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,209
without being a season pass holders kind

323
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,250
of low it's well marked you don't want

324
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,680
to get caught the fact that the system

325
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,780
might accidentally mistake in that

326
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,000
person for a true season pass holder and

327
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,760
let them in is further still into you

328
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,830
know tiny tiny tiny but the costs of

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,240
annoying one of your best customers by

330
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,670
making them present their biometric

331
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,170
multiple times it's very expensive so

332
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,150
they actually tuned them quite the

333
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,910
opposite they make them a lot looser

334
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,130
it's easier to make a match and okay

335
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,199
maybe once in you know a hundred years

336
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,000
they let the wrong person in but oh well

337
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,820
I lost the fare for that one day's

338
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,170
ticket it's not a big deal really what

339
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,300
you need to understand is that depending

340
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,860
on your use case you need to tune these

341
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,359
things differently and there's no one

342
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,040
right answer it really just kind of

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,080
depends what are you doing this is

344
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,640
identity how important is it if you get

345
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,350
it wrong how is important is it that you

346
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:40,020
get it right so let's talk about

347
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,760
accuracy in biometrics or face this has

348
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,380
been in the news a lot and there's a lot

349
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,000
of misinformation and there's a lot of

350
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,890
things that I think really need to be

351
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,480
talked about so this is actually my

352
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,400
co-founder these two photographs were

353
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,640
taken ten years apart he started running

354
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,699
and lost 60 pounds these both match just

355
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,140
fine it's not a problem at all here's a

356
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,360
picture with some things that we did

357
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,399
these are things that common

358
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,610
people will commonly think will mess up

359
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,899
face recognition systems I'm just gonna

360
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,279
let you look at this for a few minutes

361
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,769
and try to think which ones do you think

362
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:20,360
will work and will fool an algorithm and

363
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:22,160
which ones will not work so all the ones

364
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,769
across the top are fine

365
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,029
an algorithm will be able to get you

366
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,799
know does it isn't bothered by face

367
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,600
paint you can do you know gems or

368
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,939
sequins glued onto your face hats

369
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,939
sunglasses all of those things not a

370
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:37,009
problem the one on the the lower left

371
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,959
again these are kind of black box

372
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:41,089
systems it's impossible to know exactly

373
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,768
why but my suspicion is because you

374
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,480
can't see the eyes you can't find the

375
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:46,069
face if you can't find a face you can't

376
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,019
match a face and so I think that's

377
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:50,779
what's happening there and then if you

378
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,730
distort the face shape enough again if

379
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,339
the computer can't find a face and say

380
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,679
this is a face it won't be included as a

381
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:59,059
candidate and even tried to match and so

382
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,670
you have to really come up with

383
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:04,189
something pretty extreme to do that and

384
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,290
later if you want to talk to me I can

385
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:08,118
give you all kinds of tips for avoiding

386
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,730
face recognition if you don't want to be

387
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:11,749
captured by cameras the easiest thing in

388
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,970
the world is just have your cell phone

389
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:17,119
out look down at it and walk around

390
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,799
because almost every camera is up at the

391
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:21,169
corner it I'll and you above eye level

392
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,730
if you have your head down they're gonna

393
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:25,069
be looking at the top of your head not

394
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,319
your face I can't find a face can't

395
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,939
match a face you don't really need

396
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:32,599
anything super complicated it's that

397
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:34,429
easy so one of the things I've seen in

398
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,350
the news a lot and it's kind of

399
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:38,149
upsetting to me because I really respect

400
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,949
the ACLU I admire them I think they do

401
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,169
really really good work but they've been

402
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:44,029
fighting against face recognition in a

403
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:46,189
way that I think is really I mean it's

404
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,589
just factually wrong so they would take

405
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:50,599
a picture of a pot with politician or

406
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,489
celebrity or an athlete and they would

407
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,529
compare it to the mug shot database and

408
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:57,199
say look we have 20 matches and they're

409
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:59,299
all wrong these systems are terrible but

410
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,849
remember what I told you earlier they're

411
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,679
designed to do that on purpose you could

412
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,350
give a picture of a cantaloupe to a

413
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,970
union and have it matched against a mug

414
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,450
shot full of criminals and it will give

415
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,100
you the 20 criminals at the

416
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,770
algorithm things look the most like a

417
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,420
cantaloupe and that's okay because the

418
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,460
next step is a human will be given this

419
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,459
list of candidates they will one by one

420
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,990
they're trained and they have really

421
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,030
detailed ways of doing this and they

422
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,120
will establish this person is not a

423
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,890
cantaloupe and move on the system is

424
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,080
designed to work that way so I think

425
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,790
it's a little unfair to say oh they're

426
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,800
highly inaccurate because they're coming

427
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:38,640
up with false matches of course they are

428
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,740
they're designed to do that there's

429
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,960
another case I saw in the media that I

430
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,850
thought it was interesting in that I

431
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,490
think it's it's scary but it's also

432
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,460
widely misreported and so this is in

433
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,320
Wales and the UK so the police put

434
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,600
cameras all over I'm a football stadium

435
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,650
I would call it a soccer stadium and we

436
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,210
don't know how many people on the

437
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,620
watchlist I wish I did because I think

438
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,880
that would be interesting but there were

439
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,140
about a hundred and seventy thousand

440
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,820
people in the crowd and they had

441
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,920
multiple cameras so they were presumably

442
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,960
able to take pictures of all of them and

443
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,969
they searched them against this

444
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,170
candidate list watchlist which again we

445
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,490
don't know how many people we don't know

446
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,439
the quality there's a lot of things that

447
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,960
you really need to know that we don't

448
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,570
know and they came up with about 2,500

449
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,850
candidate matches and out of those when

450
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,470
a human reviewed them only a hundred and

451
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,020
seventy three of them were actual

452
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,070
criminals who were detained and they did

453
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,520
whatever they did because they're their

454
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:32,130
police now when this was reported in the

455
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,960
media they said out of these twenty

456
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,540
three hundred only a hundred and seventy

457
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,550
were real this is terrible it's a twenty

458
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,079
nine percent you know error rate these

459
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,089
are terrible systems they don't work

460
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,410
well again the police were out they're

461
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,810
gone we caught a hundred and seventy

462
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,600
three bad guys this is awesome we didn't

463
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,030
even have to do very much and I think

464
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,050
the truth is somewhere in the middle

465
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,760
we're gonna talk in a minute about

466
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,020
conditional probability and the

467
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,840
difficulty of doing mass surveillance

468
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,819
but just by its nature mass surveillance

469
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,550
is always going to have a high rate of

470
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,790
false matches and so can you say this is

471
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,649
terrible or is this great I don't know

472
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:11,520
but I think you have to at least

473
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,560
consider the experience of the we see

474
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,079
you know two thousand people who went to

475
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,399
go see a soccer game and were had

476
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,109
somebody tap him on the shoulder and

477
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,699
there's a police officer going hey can I

478
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,479
see your ID what's going on they were

479
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,799
seeing

480
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,449
public by their friends as being

481
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,429
questioned by the police that would be

482
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,630
terrifying I would be very very

483
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,919
frightened it would not like that

484
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,200
experience I wouldn't want my friends

485
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,549
seeing that and so to really decide if

486
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,290
this is a good deal or not you really

487
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:36,270
have to also consider the harm you're

488
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,918
doing when you're finding false matches

489
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:42,150
and think about that as well

490
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,980
if those 173 people were master you know

491
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,830
villains from a Bond movie who are about

492
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,540
to go destroy entire cities okay you

493
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,939
might be able to convince me that that

494
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,530
was a reasonable thing to do I suspect

495
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,090
these are actually more like to be a

496
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,100
hundred and seventy three people who had

497
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,860
overdue parking tickets in which case

498
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,330
this is not a reasonable thing to do but

499
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,799
the key thing is I don't think police

500
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,330
should be making these decisions they're

501
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,860
human beings of course they're gonna

502
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,230
want to make to use any tool that makes

503
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,000
their job easier I mean I like to use

504
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,040
all of the tools that make my job easier

505
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,260
but they shouldn't be making that

506
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,520
decision other people should be making

507
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,230
that decision and there should be

508
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,980
restrictions and we have sort of

509
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,059
precedents for this and what yours it

510
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,429
recently has 2013

511
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,168
GPS location trackers started to get

512
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,280
cheap and they were inexpensive and

513
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,809
small enough that you could just put

514
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,639
them on cars pretty easily and then

515
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:31,980
track the location of these people and

516
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,179
the police started using it nobody gave

517
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,860
them permission didn't ask for

518
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,720
permission it's just a new technology

519
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,250
that helps them do their job and they

520
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,530
did for a while until it was contested

521
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,179
in court and what the lawyer said is

522
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,309
this is unreasonable search is

523
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,429
unconstitutional and the police said

524
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:49,200
well you know we have detectives and

525
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:51,030
when we suspect somebody of a crime we

526
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,559
sometimes follow them that's we're just

527
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,000
using technology to help us do what

528
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,870
we've been doing anyway this isn't new

529
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,780
and the court said well you can follow

530
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:03,178
one car this technology allows you to

531
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,600
follow all of the cars and no that's

532
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:08,490
unreasonable and so now since 2013 you

533
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,949
have to get a warrant to use a GPS

534
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,390
tracker and put on a car and I think

535
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,679
that's kind of analogy of where we need

536
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,690
to go with some of the identity

537
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,340
technology that's coming out we need to

538
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,080
have a thoughtful conversation about how

539
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,980
do we restrict it and how do we use it

540
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,409
appropriately and it's really really

541
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,630
hard to talk about and it's because it's

542
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,070
probabilistic and I'm going to use a

543
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,400
medical example because I think it's a

544
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,570
little

545
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,040
easier to understand and this is

546
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,189
personal to me I've been pregnant twice

547
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,290
and both times they do and every

548
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,090
pregnant person in America gets a really

549
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,780
simple non-invasive test to test for

550
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,760
Down syndrome

551
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,040
both times I tested positive which was

552
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,530
really scary and they said don't worry

553
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,340
about it it's okay talking about this is

554
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,800
not okay

555
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,980
so the probability actually your baby

556
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,020
having town syndrome is one in 800 okay

557
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,070
it's not you know I'd like better but

558
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,200
it's not terrible

559
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,080
the test itself has a false positive

560
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,570
grade about 0.05 and a false negative at

561
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,250
0.1 9 again hard to really understand

562
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,389
what that means but remember we're

563
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,390
talking about something that's super

564
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:12,030
rare if you test positive there's a 2%

565
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:14,400
chance that your baby actually has Down

566
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,530
syndrome I mean that sounds crazy but

567
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,080
that's actually how the math all works

568
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,030
out and it's because I mean a test

569
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,610
that's 99% accurate is going to be wrong

570
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,960
1% at a time and if you're testing

571
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,810
something for something that is much

572
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,600
more rare than 1% just the errors of the

573
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:33,899
test or going to completely overwhelm

574
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,790
the numbers of actual cases and since

575
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,410
you know that you can choose to use this

576
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,480
test in a certain way and so this is a

577
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,580
screening test and after this they ask

578
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,750
you okay we have other tests that are

579
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,820
more expensive they're more invasive

580
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,530
they're more difficult do you want to do

581
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,360
that and then you can go get a test that

582
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,490
will actually tell you you know if your

583
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,110
baby is healthy or not but this was a

584
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,390
terrifying experience to me as a

585
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,580
first-time mother and it was completely

586
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,680
non-intuitive she tested positive

587
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,889
clearly my baby has Down syndrome

588
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,140
no it's only a 2% chance but the analogy

589
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,120
and face recognition is when we start

590
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,760
using it for mass surveillance if you're

591
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,739
looking for something that's rare and

592
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,290
criminals are rare I mean people can

593
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,640
talk about how you know just the society

594
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,680
is declining and everything's terrible

595
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,590
it actually crime is going down things

596
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,720
are getting better and so in general

597
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,709
criminals are very very very rare so the

598
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,300
likelihood that you're going to

599
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,640
encounter one if you're filming large

600
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,100
sums of people it's much much smaller

601
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,020
than the accuracy of any kind of face

602
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,110
recognition system even really good ones

603
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,580
and so if you use it on large crowds of

604
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,229
people looking for something that's rare

605
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,189
you are always going to be overwhelmed

606
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,809
by false positives

607
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,580
so let's talk a little bit we're gonna

608
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,230
transition to privacy laws because I

609
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,789
think we've made some some good inroads

610
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,460
but I don't think we're quite all the

611
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:53,789
way there and there's still a lot of

612
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,190
really bad information out so this I

613
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:58,620
think is really kind of scary if the

614
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,330
states and navy-blue sends their drivers

615
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,860
license pictures to the federal

616
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,439
government to be included in a face

617
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,240
database so Texas you're already in

618
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,820
there they we think about 50% of

619
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,140
Americans are already in a database that

620
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,450
the federal government has put together

621
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,309
the gray states do not the blue ones

622
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,130
will only send mug shots or limited

623
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:19,980
amounts of data but to some extent your

624
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:23,250
data is out there not just your face but

625
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,110
all kinds of information so all of the

626
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,270
privacy laws are really talking about

627
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,559
identity technology and it's important

628
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,610
to realize that when we're talking about

629
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,220
face recognition

630
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,320
that's one identity technology there are

631
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,340
lots and if you're worried about mass

632
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
surveillance if you're worried about

633
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,270
privacy law you need to be worried about

634
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,610
all of them I'm current technology can

635
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,080
do iris recognition iris is the colored

636
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,270
ring around the pupil of your eye from

637
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,460
six to ten feet away and without you

638
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,379
doing anything if you have your hands

639
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,110
visible you can get fingerprints again

640
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,970
from at least 6 to 10 feet away there's

641
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,530
sensors that are just glass you can just

642
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,620
wave your hand over and at full speed

643
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,350
get fingerprints faces obviously they

644
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,600
have you can get a face image very very

645
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,760
far away but those are the really common

646
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,129
modalities but there's others the way

647
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,020
you walk yet that is a unique human

648
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,480
characteristic and that can be recorded

649
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,549
and used to identify you we don't really

650
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,650
do retina anymore and we used to you'll

651
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:18,480
see that in movies still to collect

652
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,640
retina enrollment you had to shine

653
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,830
really bright lights into the back of

654
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,390
people's eyes it was painful people

655
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,850
didn't like doing it and then to match

656
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,970
you had to do it again and so not a

657
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:32,600
popular modality voice gait the way you

658
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,220
type and there's even an ear biometric

659
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,689
all of them are identification and so

660
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,049
all of them need to be considered if

661
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,600
you're thinking about privacy so DDP are

662
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:44,190
is sort of the the big privacy law that

663
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,799
everybody's been talking about recently

664
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,640
it doesn't really apply to us here and

665
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,560
last

666
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,480
you have to either be operating from in

667
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,580
the U or working with people who are in

668
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,630
the EU so maybe it does it kind of

669
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:59,520
depends but I really I like this sort of

670
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,560
template that it is set and we're seeing

671
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,500
other people move in that direction it's

672
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,669
really common sense before you'd collect

673
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,620
identity information you have to have a

674
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,300
reason a business reason you can't be

675
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,909
collecting data just you know for fun

676
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,860
you have to have informed consent and it

677
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,230
has to be real consent it can't be a

678
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,909
long list of fine print that they just

679
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,980
click on okay they have to specifically

680
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,380
be asked this is the data we're

681
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,480
collecting I'm informing you is that ok

682
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,400
they consent and if it's not required

683
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,770
for the business use it has to be

684
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,660
optional they have the right of access

685
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,910
and erasure which means at any time they

686
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,410
can ask you what data do you have on me

687
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,540
and you have to be able to answer that

688
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,800
question pretty quickly and they have

689
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,330
the right to be forgotten or the right

690
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,669
to have their data erased again in

691
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,649
certain circumstances you have to have

692
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,600
an e representative physically in the u

693
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,460
available to answer questions and to

694
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,379
talk about any questions they may have

695
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,750
handle the right of access and erasure

696
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,910
and then the big thing is data breach

697
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,010
you have to be notified within 72 hours

698
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,170
unless it's encrypted

699
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,879
if the data that was breached was

700
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:03,920
encrypted such that it can't be used for

701
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,920
anything you don't have to notify them

702
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:11,040
so Illinois has I think the most

703
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:14,399
interesting privacy law raise your hand

704
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,960
if you've heard of PIPA okay couple

705
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,730
people the thing that makes it really

706
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,820
unique it has a right for private action

707
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,770
meaning if you as an individual can sue

708
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,080
the company if you're if they have

709
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,600
violated this law and given that it

710
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,550
passed in 2008 and I don't think anyone

711
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,889
actually noticed until like three years

712
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,350
ago there have been a lot of violations

713
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:37,230
the law basically says you have to get

714
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,850
written release that says this is what

715
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,310
you're collecting why and how long we're

716
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,230
going to retain it this this next one

717
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,760
the you have to have a public written

718
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,200
retention policy and that's another one

719
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,580
that's gotten a lot of companies in

720
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,260
trouble they would have a retention

721
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,770
policy but they didn't make it public

722
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,210
that's a violation there is a really

723
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,650
this was written with the intention of

724
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,630
they were worried about time clocks

725
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,170
biometric time clocks and there are

726
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,540
companies where they had people

727
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,520
going into work biometric has collected

728
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,250
leave at the end of the day biometrics

729
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,710
collected four years every single one of

730
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,970
those collections is a violation and

731
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,060
it's worth twenty five hundred dollars

732
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,320
and the individual has the right to sue

733
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,350
directly they don't have to have the

734
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,439
Attorney General bring suit so it's been

735
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,629
the the source or the inspiration for a

736
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,190
lot of lobbyists and a lot of money

737
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,500
Facebook Google all of them are facing

738
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,510
massive fines and they're fighting it

739
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,540
very hard so far they've been totally

740
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,160
unsuccessful there are restrictions on

741
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,810
how you can sell and share data and

742
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,340
you'll see this in a lot of the state

743
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,470
laws you have to store any of this

744
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,800
identity data at or above industry

745
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:45,490
standards or as securely as the most

746
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,659
confidential data that you have Texas I

747
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,300
don't know that a lot of people realize

748
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:52,360
this has a biometric line it's from 2009

749
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,290
it's not very well written but hey it's

750
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,510
better than nothing

751
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,310
it basically again they were thinking

752
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,140
about biometric time clock so it really

753
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,690
covers the relationship between a Texas

754
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,040
employer and the employee says you have

755
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,440
to get consent before collecting

756
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,270
biometric or any kind of identity you

757
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,830
have to give them you know inform them

758
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,050
what you're collecting and why they have

759
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,879
to consent explicitly you have to tell

760
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:15,040
them if you have any say in any plans to

761
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,870
sell lease or disclose the data there's

762
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,000
restrictions on what you can do with it

763
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,830
you have that same reasonable standard

764
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,540
of care for how you store the data and

765
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,820
you have to destroy it if you're no

766
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:28,210
longer need it or use it and up to one

767
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:30,010
year since you've last used it it's kind

768
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,600
of vague because it specifically applies

769
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,520
to commercial use which is not defined

770
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,469
and there's a couple of things that are

771
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,050
in there that are lo odd but you know

772
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,250
still it's a good start

773
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:41,379
Washington State was the next one to

774
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,150
come up with a very specific law this

775
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,770
one applies to any company collecting

776
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,170
for commercial use again that's a little

777
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,060
vague but before you collect data you

778
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,800
have to inform people this is what I'm

779
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,139
collecting and this is why you have to

780
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,629
get explicit consent and again that's

781
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,190
defined as I didn't just you know glance

782
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,920
through Terms of Service and click okay

783
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,880
you had to explicitly ask me and I said

784
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,510
it was okay in a way that was

785
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,280
unmistakable you can't sell this or

786
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,350
share the data without telling them

787
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,870
there's restrictions there that same

788
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,730
reasonable care standard for storage and

789
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,020
destroy and it's not in use anymore so

790
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,770
again you're starting to see some

791
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,090
similarities between all of these laws

792
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,590
California is the the big one it

793
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,929
actually doesn't go into effect until

794
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,399
January and it's still in play I think

795
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,840
until it just a couple of weeks ago they

796
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,190
still had six amendments and so we

797
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,970
weren't entirely sure how this is all

798
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,000
going to shake out

799
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:34,130
it applies to any company with over 25

800
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,050
million in annual gross revenue more

801
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,700
than 50% of their revenue comes from

802
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,419
personal data or they sell more than

803
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,100
fifty thousand data points Facebook

804
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,270
before you collect data you have to say

805
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,280
what is being collected

806
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,750
you can't retain it if it's a one-time

807
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,428
transaction in other words if you don't

808
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,980
need to retain retain it for a business

809
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:54,679
use you can't and then we start to see

810
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,090
very similar things disclose and sell

811
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,290
lease or share data you have to tell

812
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,629
them you have to get their permission

813
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,220
you have to update the privacy policy

814
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,660
every 12 months and that has to be

815
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,640
published in a way that can be verified

816
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,890
that's going to trip some people up I

817
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,110
promise you and then customers have to

818
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,179
have two ways to request their data to

819
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,919
be deleted it could be a cell phone I

820
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,350
mean a phone number and a website link

821
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,460
it could be probably a billboard and

822
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,659
something else but there have to be two

823
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,240
ways and that's another thing that's

824
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,470
gonna trip up some people I think the

825
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,110
other one I'm trying to remorse they

826
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:27,320
have a very sort of arcane description

827
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,659
of like what concern do and what is a

828
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,000
transaction and so effectively this is

829
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,950
going to apply to a lot of people again

830
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,870
not until January it's gonna take a

831
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,550
while to kind of shake out how this all

832
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:43,010
works but it's going to be interesting

833
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:44,000
Massachusetts has some proposed things

834
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,940
that they're doing they're gonna have

835
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,250
specific fines for each violation it's

836
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,110
very well supported a lot of people in

837
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,270
Massachusetts when a moratorium on all

838
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:54,800
of it for government use again people in

839
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,090
general tend to be concerned about what

840
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,040
the government is going to do with it

841
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:59,899
they're worried about living in a black

842
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,510
mirror episode or having Big Brother

843
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,340
over us now sure I don't know that

844
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,540
anyone who's for that but we that's

845
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,050
something we absolutely need to be

846
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,280
careful about but that is not passed

847
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,960
there's a lot of other people who are

848
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,240
proposing laws are beginning to prove

849
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,100
pose laws or talking about it all of

850
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,490
them kind of follow that same format

851
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,300
that you've seen they have different

852
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,250
exterminations of what's personally

853
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,990
identifier information and the New York

854
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,280
and Maryland

855
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,100
both have bills that are in committee

856
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,660
now and again once the bill passed and

857
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,820
we're seeing this with gdpr it's great

858
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,320
that it passed but there's still a lot

859
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,720
of things that are vague we don't really

860
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,189
understand exactly what's required we're

861
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,110
gonna have to go through court have

862
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,450
precedent set get it a general

863
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,159
understanding of exactly what this all

864
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:46,120
means and it's going to be years before

865
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,520
this is all worked out so just a summary

866
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,780
if you're going to be working with face

867
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,940
what you know any kind of identity

868
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,460
information face fingerprint and iris

869
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,950
are the the common modalities this is

870
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,870
really kind of common sense only collect

871
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,130
the information that you need to do

872
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,219
whatever it is that you're doing

873
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,660
get real informed consent don't try to

874
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,420
hide it don't try to slip it through

875
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,700
terms and service actually you know ask

876
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,980
people and if it's not required you have

877
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,559
to give them an option only retain data

878
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,780
if you need it use best practices for

879
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,100
storing that data and then review and I

880
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,990
think right now the community kind of

881
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,669
recommends every six months review your

882
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,860
policies review your data and make sure

883
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,240
we haven't had something change some new

884
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,800
data's come in we haven't paid attention

885
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,780
to it it's not being protected the way

886
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,090
it needs to be but all this is really

887
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,899
common sense I don't think any of this

888
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,428
is onerous or difficult yeah templates

889
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,770
are similar to a hash they're not a hash

890
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:40,000
because it's not it's not every you

891
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,740
don't go to the same template every

892
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,780
single time you go to a very very very

893
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,370
very similar template which is where the

894
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,290
probabilistic you know conditional

895
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,120
probability comes in so but that's

896
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,460
effectively what templates are doing

897
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,340
there again it's it's similar to a hash

898
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,679
but it's not literally ash right and

899
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,360
that is effectively what we want to be

900
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:00,850
really careful about but I think the

901
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,469
risk it's a little well it's a little

902
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,270
overstated but it's something that we

903
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,730
need to be really really careful about

904
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,200
because of what I was saying with the

905
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,330
conditional probability it's really

906
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,670
actually difficult to do this sort of

907
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,439
black mirror esque everybody's being

908
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,990
watched I mean there's so many false

909
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,160
positives that you would it's like all

910
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,750
of the data that we have that we don't

911
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,100
actually look at it's easy to collect it

912
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,020
it's hard to actually get anything

913
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,550
actionable out of it if you literally

914
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,710
were collecting data on every person

915
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,870
there's no way we can process all that

916
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,360
data or make any kind of decision based

917
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,668
on it so the the risk

918
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,949
isn't as high as people fear and when

919
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:37,470
you see every new technology that comes

920
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,880
out there is some amount of okay hang on

921
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,289
what's going on it's the end of the

922
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,870
world it's the end of privacy this is

923
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,820
bad and then we adapt we come up with

924
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,559
best practices we come up with laws we

925
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,389
come up with regulations and ways of

926
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,639
using the technology that's controlled

927
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,919
and we haven't done that yet we don't

928
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,690
yet know does it require a warrant or

929
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,340
maybe there's really no way to do this

930
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,440
with a warrant the police don't they

931
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,059
just can't do it I personally think that

932
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,029
all of these identity system should be

933
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:04,678
opted in and voluntary if you are opting

934
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:06,240
in and you choose to do it and you have

935
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,429
an option it's hard to see how that

936
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,500
could really go badly I'm a member of

937
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:12,299
the TSA pre-program because when I fly I

938
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,440
don't want to take my shoes off and

939
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,120
they're about to introduce space

940
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,950
recognition and so I'll be able to still

941
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,330
walk through I don't have to stop give

942
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,440
my driver's license to the guy he

943
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,389
doesn't have to scribble on it with

944
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,460
really bad handwriting I can just walk

945
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:26,580
through put my bag on the belt and walk

946
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,320
on I'm a fan I too know I will choose to

947
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,928
do that but I will absolutely always

948
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,539
want there to be a choice not to do that

949
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:34,830
because me using this and me deciding to

950
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:36,899
give my data to get something in

951
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:39,120
exchange it's very very different from

952
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,260
having something done to me well one

953
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,449
thing I was also gonna say is we've

954
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,970
actually seen this play out many many

955
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,590
many times I was reading I just think

956
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,269
that the history of sort of how we adopt

957
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,970
new technology is really interesting and

958
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,470
when cars first came out there are all

959
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,970
of these people writing to the paper and

960
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,250
cents and terrified it's going to be the

961
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:58,200
end of society because they were in the

962
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,000
way of people this paths and these roads

963
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,230
were made for people and for pedestrians

964
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,179
in these cars were taking up all the

965
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,639
space and they would hit people and

966
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,840
there's a Gilbert and Sullivan the

967
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:08,368
Sullivan I can't bear his name he

968
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,259
actually wrote a letter to the editor he

969
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:12,300
said we should be allowed to shoot on

970
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,250
sight discourteous drivers near they're

971
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,190
a menace and these cars should just go

972
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,839
away okay that didn't happen when kodaik

973
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,668
came out with portable cameras you know

974
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,049
cameras used to be really big the old

975
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:24,179
Sol when they came out with portable

976
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,159
ones again this is the end of privacy

977
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,750
you can just go out and people can be

978
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,940
taking your picture and you don't even

979
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,800
know this is the end of society it's the

980
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,619
end of privacy this is a terrible

981
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,599
terrible thing but we adapt it you know

982
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:38,700
and we now really don't have that much

983
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,379
concern with digital cameras and my

984
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,710
favorite one is in the 70s there's a

985
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,118
whole

986
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,580
series of books again it's the end of

987
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,070
privacy it's the end of society the sky

988
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,629
is falling and this is in the 70s there

989
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,700
can anyone guess what technology was

990
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,980
being introduced that introduced such

991
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:55,168
fear

992
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:58,830
it was the relational database because

993
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:00,060
until then data was siloed and you kind

994
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,440
of you know left hand didn't know what

995
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,420
the right hand was doing and there's

996
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,369
some advantages to that now there's

997
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,930
gonna be one global database where

998
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,130
everything about you is there the

999
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,169
government is gonna know they're gonna

1000
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:13,050
be tracking you from birth to grave it's

1001
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:15,060
the end of the world didn't really

1002
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,220
happen that way and I think relational

1003
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,660
databases are pretty useful I think

1004
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,700
we're gonna see something similar here

1005
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,770
we're gonna adapt we're gonna come up

1006
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,990
with rules and restrictions and things

1007
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,580
that we can and can't do with identity

1008
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,279
some of it will be legal some of it will

1009
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,080
be cultural and we will move on and find

1010
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,420
a way to use these in ways that help us

1011
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:37,348
and prevent people from using them in

1012
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:39,690
ways that hurt us well we've already

1013
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:41,880
made some decisions about what you have

1014
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,859
to do to travel you have to have some

1015
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,359
kind of ID and identify yourself to

1016
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:47,460
enter the country or to enter a foreign

1017
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,509
country if you want to go to Britain you

1018
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,220
have to give them some kind of

1019
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,470
identification and they get to say no we

1020
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,330
don't want you you have to get a visa

1021
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,709
and they can say yeah yeah I don't think

1022
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,920
so you can't get a visa you can't come

1023
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,210
in we've decided that that's okay same

1024
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,490
thing with their travel I'm not really

1025
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,680
sure how or why but we've decided it's

1026
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,089
okay to identify yourself I think it's

1027
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,440
really interesting I'm a libertarian

1028
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:09,540
I've never been through that machine

1029
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,150
once I opt out every time and I travel a

1030
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,190
lot people at the airport know me I just

1031
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,540
I just don't like him and honestly I've

1032
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,830
gotten asked over and over again okay

1033
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,670
it's not that big of a deal it's not

1034
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,200
gonna give you cancer

1035
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,540
you know honestly it's just because I

1036
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,310
can I think we have to exercise our

1037
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,700
rights and we'll lose them and so I'm

1038
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,830
opting out because I can but having said

1039
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,259
that when they started doing face

1040
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,119
recognition at the port of entry and

1041
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,580
Dulles the Washington DC Airport in the

1042
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,950
first week they count they found three

1043
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,420
people with fake passports coming in

1044
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,669
from foreign countries into the United

1045
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,089
States who had passports that resembled

1046
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,039
them but were not them and then they

1047
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:46,900
a separate set of documentation hidden

1048
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,979
you in a secret pocket in their bag

1049
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,719
three people in the first week I can

1050
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:54,308
argue on whether we should you know have

1051
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,069
the identity of people who come in we

1052
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:58,930
can go into immigration politics but we

1053
00:36:57,069 --> 00:37:00,489
have decided that we get to decide who

1054
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,098
comes in and so the fact that we found

1055
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:04,359
three in one week is a little unnerving

1056
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,440
who are these people what are they doing

1057
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:08,200
why aren't they using their regular

1058
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,200
passport what's up I don't know I mean I

1059
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,989
think there's a fine balance between we

1060
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,819
have a police force and again I'm a

1061
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:17,739
libertarian but I'm still want to have a

1062
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:19,839
police force because I'm small I was the

1063
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:21,249
nerdy kid in school I needed somebody to

1064
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,078
watch out for me because if we're gonna

1065
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:25,149
live in mob rules I'm gonna be

1066
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:26,859
somebody's property so if my house is

1067
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,249
getting broken into I'm not gonna stand

1068
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:32,170
up to handle that I'm gonna call 911 I

1069
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:33,609
have strong issues about how we do

1070
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,589
police saying things that we should do

1071
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:37,058
differently but at the end of the day I

1072
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,979
would rather have a police force than

1073
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:40,650
not have one again this because I'm

1074
00:37:38,979 --> 00:37:42,729
small other people may feel differently

1075
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,739
so these are the kinds of conversations

1076
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:47,348
that I think are really important to

1077
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:49,630
have if it's to be truly optin and

1078
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:52,420
voluntary that can't be lip service it

1079
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:54,579
has to truly be opt-in and voluntary it

1080
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,140
may be a pain to opt out at the TSA oh

1081
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,400
and what do you from not to you because

1082
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,629
TSA you don't have to go through those

1083
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,359
machines which is one of the reasons I

1084
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:03,069
joined the program but if I occasionally

1085
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,499
I don't you know they don't print it on

1086
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:06,969
my boarding pass I have a choice I can

1087
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:09,009
just go through the machine if I want to

1088
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:10,839
that one time or I can opt out as long

1089
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:12,849
as that the real choice then it's a real

1090
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,469
choice but the only reason will get to

1091
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:16,690
keep that as a real choices people use

1092
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:19,210
it and people take advantage of that and

1093
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,430
actually don't and right now the non TSA

1094
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,259
line is always longer than the TSA line

1095
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,479
it costs money it's a pain you have to

1096
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,769
go give them your identification you

1097
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:29,319
have to go register it's kind of

1098
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:30,848
difficult so I don't think at least

1099
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:31,589
right now anyway that that's my biggest

1100
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,450
concern

1101
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:37,089
I don't think that a machine can have

1102
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:39,848
bias I mean it's like it's an algorithm

1103
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:42,489
but machines are built by people and

1104
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:44,289
people absolutely have bias and we build

1105
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:46,180
them to do a task and that task was

1106
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:48,130
built on how a person thinks that task

1107
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,290
should be done and so there's a whole

1108
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,930
set of assumptions

1109
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,100
in that and in general for machine

1110
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,299
vision when you're gonna train an

1111
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,610
algorithm and this is a gross

1112
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,310
simplification we don't actually know

1113
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,870
how they work back 10 years ago face

1114
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,110
rack isn't new we would use a thing

1115
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,940
called

1116
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,710
eigenfaces which is basically linear

1117
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,860
algebra you could kind of think of a

1118
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:09,630
face represented as a series of faces

1119
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,840
all laid on top of each other so it'd be

1120
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:15,030
like well my face is 20% of Susan with a

1121
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,190
minus 5 of Bob and these 3 feet and that

1122
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:21,390
all combines to be me so is this really

1123
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:22,320
complex and it and it worked ok 80% we

1124
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,569
don't do that anymore

1125
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,000
now we've got deep learning in AI and

1126
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:30,120
it's all just a black box neural net we

1127
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,920
feed it a ton of trained datasets these

1128
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,600
are two people who are the same face but

1129
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,040
more data the better these are two

1130
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,990
people who are not the same face and

1131
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,670
with massive amounts of data then you

1132
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,560
start telling the computer ok tell me do

1133
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:43,170
they match or not and you check it they

1134
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,000
get really really good but those

1135
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,410
algorithms are only as good as the

1136
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,570
training data so if you put your

1137
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,279
training together well and this is an

1138
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,900
art more than a science you'll get a

1139
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,700
very accurate algorithm and there's some

1140
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,410
really good ones out there if you put

1141
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,390
your training together training set

1142
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,790
together badly you're gonna get your

1143
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:02,310
garbage in garbage out and so there were

1144
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:04,590
some early algorithms that really they

1145
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,970
were all trained on white college

1146
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,650
students because those were the faces

1147
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,810
that are cheap and easily available and

1148
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,880
so they worked really well on 20 year

1149
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:14,220
old white guys and not as well on other

1150
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,780
people since then people have improved

1151
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,490
algorithms they're constantly trying to

1152
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,260
come up with more data and make them

1153
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:22,020
better and make them more you know

1154
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,610
robust but it again identities not a

1155
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,050
hundred percent any given group of

1156
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,990
people it's not going to be the same

1157
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:29,790
because humans can't do it that well I

1158
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,649
turned her in the name of it there's

1159
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:34,200
actually a name for this and it's it's

1160
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,120
true people recognize their own the

1161
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,950
group of people that you grew up in you

1162
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,270
will recognize them better than the

1163
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,250
people you didn't grow up with so if you

1164
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,500
grew up on an island with Alaska and

1165
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,940
Inuits you would see all kinds of

1166
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,460
differences in their faces and you would

1167
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,260
be able to recognize Eskimos with huge

1168
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,210
details they all look the same to me and

1169
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,610
then if you take that person and go move

1170
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,870
them to them

1171
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,520
they look at all these white people oh

1172
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,410
man they all look the same that's

1173
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,600
because our brains are just that's how

1174
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,250
we trained the brain the algorithm you

1175
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,140
grew up seeing a certain set of faces

1176
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,570
were really good at recognizing faces

1177
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,910
that we are already familiar with we're

1178
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:08,260
really not very good at recognizing

1179
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,060
unfamiliar faces not nearly as good as

1180
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,310
we think we are the advantage of

1181
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,590
computer has is it can look at million

1182
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,840
faces without getting tired it's a

1183
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,730
tedious repetitive task people are not

1184
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,810
very good at it computers aren't a

1185
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:25,080
hundred percent but neither are people

1186
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,080
does that make sense

1187
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:30,340
again there are huge issues of bias and

1188
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,900
specifically in policing but honestly

1189
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,210
and this is sort of a contrarian

1190
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,250
position I think algorithms are gonna do

1191
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:38,560
more to help them to hurt because bias

1192
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,820
comes from people and one of the reasons

1193
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,070
I was telling you for fingerprint

1194
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,510
analysts they're always given 20 and

1195
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,700
that's not that's on purpose because

1196
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,500
they don't want the person to just let

1197
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,960
the machine do something if the Machine

1198
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,030
says oh here there's one candidate I'm

1199
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,740
gonna look at it yeah that's it if I get

1200
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,600
three and the top ones probably and if I

1201
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,310
get twenty none of these are a match I

1202
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,900
stopped doing it because it's a tedious

1203
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,420
repetitive task that people aren't good

1204
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,070
at so they specifically give them 20 and

1205
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,990
force them to analyze all 20 of them

1206
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,970
even if the first ones a match you have

1207
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,890
to go process all 20 of them and you

1208
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,390
send that to somebody else and if there

1209
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,100
is a match it's double check to find an

1210
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:14,200
independent person who doesn't know the

1211
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,299
answers that you got because it's a very

1212
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,279
very difficult task it's difficult to do

1213
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,280
well it's difficult to do without by us

1214
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,830
okay well if there's no other questions

1215
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,160
thank you it's been a pleasure to come

1216
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,160
today

1217
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,500
you

1218
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,450
you
