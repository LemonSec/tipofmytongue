2
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,409
explain here so I come from the

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,910
enterprise you may remember us from the

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,180
far right column of the pricing page

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:32,990
that you have to send emails to

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,670
understand more about why that's

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,010
important right is because like many

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,780
enterprises<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a bunch of software</font>

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">some which I wrote myself some of which</font>

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:46,820
I didn't and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sort of</font>

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,890
following all of the last con advice

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,650
that's come about the past couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">days not so easy I have to do some</font>

14
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,600
tricks to make it happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font>

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,520
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Shannon slide from the opening</font>

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,050
keynote she says well you know if you're

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,750
stuck doing stuff on the right hand side

18
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,390
just dealing with deploys and monitoring

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,590
or you're in trouble well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:12,950
kind of a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how you can still</font>

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:15,890
architect architect things well if that

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,200
is kind of where you're stuck but you

23
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,690
have to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit creative with</font>

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:25,009
how you use identity and authorization

25
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,660
so it's a good kind of kicking off point

26
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,399
also really good talks related to this

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,610
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw Michael</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Schwartz's talk on</font>

28
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:34,220
glue or per box talk on dub from wso2

29
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:38,390
and OAuth earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do some</font>

30
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">callback references so you try and take</font>

31
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,810
what they did and balance it a little

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,520
bit with a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a customer review and</font>

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,009
a bit of practical detail around how we

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,410
integrate those things in the real world

35
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:55,130
of a large you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand person</font>

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:56,899
financial institution so the deal is

37
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:03,229
when I'm when I'm stuck with with

38
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:04,640
products like this I want to basically I

39
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,099
need to need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect the environment</font>

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,538
they live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not mine and so the</font>

41
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,330
natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for me to do is wrap them</font>

42
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:13,970
in a hard perimeter right build a system

43
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,340
that looks like a castle one giant wall

44
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,130
and assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you're on site you</font>

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,860
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and when you're off site you</font>

46
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,180
don't have access to the castle if i

47
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,980
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy high ass ass thing its</font>

48
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,579
please fill out this 300 question vendor

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,319
questionnaire it's some you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

50
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,250
to send a road warrior out into the big

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,739
scary world well

52
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,050
slap a VPN maybe BitLocker or some other

53
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,430
file encryption and just hope hope and

54
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,680
pray that everything is successful but

55
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,360
of course that's hasn't been tenable for

56
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,830
a long time right I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage this</font>

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,600
transition well where each application

58
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">managed to just own security whether I</font>

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,690
wrote it or not where the devices and

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,900
access points that people use to access

61
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,670
my data wherever it lives are secure so

62
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,030
everything is managed and to end and I

63
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,859
don't lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything even though I can't</font>

64
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,739
have a single castle wall anymore so

65
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:06,200
Google actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> described this really</font>

66
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:09,470
well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a 2014 paper they</font>

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,299
published they called it beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> Corp and</font>

68
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,810
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly not the first to come</font>

69
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,280
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as my as my boss reminds me</font>

70
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,140
what field if he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking about the</font>

71
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of parameters in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s but but</font>

72
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,230
they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> published this pattern</font>

73
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,519
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and it's one that I find is</font>

74
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,840
really applicable and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

75
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,160
says is that instead of relying on

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,959
location from the sense of inside a

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,000
perimeter to grant you access and

78
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,180
trusting VPNs to virtualize your

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,340
perimeter when you have to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

80
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,410
build your access so that it's based<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

81
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,510
user identity mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

82
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,150
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> device credentials</font>

83
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,540
environment details location the thing

84
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,489
being accessed so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I leave</font>

85
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,530
you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing that is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font>

86
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,570
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you with as you architect</font>

87
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,519
your application as you architect your

88
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,190
framework especially if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

89
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,170
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source software try not to</font>

90
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,459
architect to your applications in such a

91
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,280
way the permission is a function

92
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:10,340
exclusively of user identity or maybe of

93
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,760
groups it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function of the attributes</font>

94
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,410
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user that come with the user</font>

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,728
authentication time so things like

96
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,790
device things like location things like

97
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:22,479
context ultimately gets attributes of

98
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> session right not of the user so</font>

99
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,050
again you know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this already</font>

100
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,610
even if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy</font>

101
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,220
with Samuel and a loss you may not

102
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize it but you are if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running</font>

103
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,400
your applications where they're only

104
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,610
accessible behind a firewall or they're

105
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,260
only accessible from certain devices

106
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,460
you're just managing it with physical

107
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,650
security and you're managing it with

108
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,690
network security let's manage it in a

109
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,090
better way so

110
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll cover kind of in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next 30</font>

111
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,280
ish minutes a quick recap of what

112
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,390
enterprise infrastructure looks like I

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,099
know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an app set conference so I</font>

114
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,409
not sure how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> full-time blue team's</font>

115
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,050
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> although a lot of pen testers</font>

116
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,420
here so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine most of this won't be</font>

117
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,650
huge news for you I'll walk you through

118
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the components of the paper that</font>

119
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a bunch of demos and code that i</font>

120
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,930
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you of how we're</font>

121
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,280
implementing this pattern but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

122
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,070
let me be clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you about where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

123
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,530
am this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those talks where i'm</font>

124
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,810
pretty sure this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good idea we have</font>

125
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,700
it working in prod a little bit but

126
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">before I go too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far with it and lock</font>

127
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,240
myself into something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is unique and</font>

128
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,880
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want feedback from the community</font>

129
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:34,290
so hope hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that from you guys</font>

130
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,640
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I've worked on the</font>

131
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:41,370
puzzle and now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for feedback</font>

132
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:44,520
so brief recap enterprise infrastructure

133
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,720
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps tech people so um obviously the</font>

134
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,430
most important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamental thing</font>

135
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,610
about security is knowing what my assets

136
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,520
are right so i classify them in a sense

137
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,440
as be on corporate recommend into tears

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,820
there's the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i barely care about</font>

139
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,580
and all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font>

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,110
you know cause me to wake<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the</font>

141
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,460
middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the night screaming if I when</font>

142
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,670
I think of a new vulnerability that

143
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,500
exists to them and while the data that i

144
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,840
care about is organized into tears like

145
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,960
this unfortunately my applications often

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,760
aren't and so I have to protect

147
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,940
applications that contain the sensitive

148
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,469

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,840
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my business logic a lot of my</font>

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,900
client PII and a lot of my company

151
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,169
operating details at the level of the

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">most sensitive thing they contain which</font>

153
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,030
often means that I am over complicating

154
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,270
the design of more sensitive pieces of

155
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:40,289
my infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to not do</font>

156
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:44,960
that right it's about managing my risk

157
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:47,130
well it's about not assuming that the

158
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,659
sams critical controls or whatever

159
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,820
control framework as your<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite is</font>

160
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,330
equally appropriate to everything in my

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure because a lot of controls</font>

162
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,919
really make you x bad right if I have to

163
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,318
everything through a proxy or<font color="#E5E5E5"> AV break</font>

164
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,628
certain things so I want to pick the

165
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">right controls for the right set of</font>

166
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:09,009

167
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">accessed sometimes if it's the most</font>

168
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,580

169
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,669
controls are going to be really onerous

170
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,109
and sometimes they're not when they're

171
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:20,948
not I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people a little</font>

172
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,870
bit more freedom so the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I use</font>

179
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,169

you're already used to the notion of

as as they are I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get creative</font>

237
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:48,490
and the best tool there is the identity

being accessed so identity to be clear

249
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,120
as not just a matter of knowing a

protocol or two it's it's a governance

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:12,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">down no I won't let you do that pretty</font>

291
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:14,860
straightforward right it's how you

292
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:19,029
define a policy enforcement point the

293
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,220
obvious one here is laughs or any sort

294
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:25,029
of field term web access management is a

295
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:30,040
similar thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does this you know</font>

296
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">your api api gateway is doing something</font>

297
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,010
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as well so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

298
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,750
claim that there's any magic in the

299
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,430
policy enforcement point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what's</font>

300
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,810
going on line the scenes and the logic

301
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:43,870
it has to do it turns out there's no one

302
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:46,449
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems to do this well recap</font>

303
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,670
how sam'l works and will show how sam'l

304
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:50,349
plays into this ecosystem right let's

305
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,880
amble does separates out the policy

306
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:56,620
enforcement point<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is your stuff</font>

307
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,839
this is the the the application that's

308
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,970
making access decisions who can and

309
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,769
can't have access to what to some extent

310
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the policy decision point this is</font>

311
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:09,250
the identity infrastructure ecosystem

312
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,199
that learns about you and decides how it

313
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,269
works so if you're not familiar with

314
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,939
Samuel basically I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hit the</font>

315
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">application application says hey you're</font>

316
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:23,709
not authenticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does a redirect via</font>

317
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,519
HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> POST to me me the identity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provider</font>

318
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:29,290
IDP the IDP usually is going to ask me

319
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">via the web for my username and password</font>

320
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:35,560
but it can do a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other things</font>

321
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:37,810
and then redirects<font color="#E5E5E5"> me again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vht</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> posts</font>

322
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,560
back to the policy and for some point

323
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,079
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the application</font>

324
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,810
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> saml ticket that sandal ticket</font>

325
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:48,910
says hey I now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the identity of this</font>

326
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:53,579
user do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will Oh auth</font>

327
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:56,439
authorization flowed similar to this so

328
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">while probably demo stuff with sama link</font>

329
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,620
one of the most important things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

330
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:04,450
is how we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to work in in an</font>

331
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,760
OAuth world as well Samuel being an

332
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,820
ancient technology in fact sends a whole

333
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,339
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things in XML the important</font>

334
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,660
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course is the user that's what</font>

335
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,000
everyone uses right they use the

336
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,829
identity but you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> include a</font>

337
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,870
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other attributes in that that</font>

338
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,580
can be fed<font color="#CCCCCC"> into your application that</font>

339
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,350
your application can use to make good

340
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">decisions and this is what I'm really</font>

341
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">pushing the other developers I work with</font>

342
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,430
to respect and this is what I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

343
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,500
guys to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about how you can</font>

344
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,620
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so where did those come from well</font>

345
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,920
my IDP normally just talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ldap right</font>

346
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,540
normally an identity provider pops up a

347
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,240
web page that<font color="#CCCCCC"> asks for your username and</font>

348
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">password if you get your username and</font>

349
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">password right it issues the sam'l</font>

350
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,010
assertion if you don't get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> book</font>

351
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,430
username and password right it blocks

352
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:55,810
you there but why would I stop there

353
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:58,199
right I it's an easy place to plug in

354
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,329
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PHA check and many users do that</font>

355
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,050
duo duo has sort of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sam rider let's do</font>

356
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,460
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> login and a bunch of other guys the</font>

357
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,660
next most important thing for me to do

358
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,300
is protect my device so a laptop has a

359
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,819
TLS cert on it installed into my browser

360
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:19,660
that uniquely identifies my device and

361
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:21,070
allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> sam'l to validate all the things</font>

362
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about my device on the back</font>

363
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,740
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my configuration database look</font>

364
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,990
for what's been going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my device</font>

365
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,180
lately to verify that independently in

366
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,450
addition to me and then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

367
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,630
do all their basic checks right I have

368
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:40,180
certain restrictions on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done</font>

369
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:42,040
for legal reasons or otherwise must be

370
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,229
done within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. limitations on what</font>

371
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:49,209
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done in other parts of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

372
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:51,590
and so I can use my identity provider to

373
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,329
enforce those restrictions again even if

374
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,640
I have an application that isn't mine

375
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,440
doesn't live behind my firewall lives

376
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,330
elsewhere so long as they speak sam'l

377
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,190
and most of the time more and more

378
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications do when they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I am</font>

379
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:11,030
forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build an app proxy so build my</font>

380
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:13,550
own API gateway<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other use case where</font>

381
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,819
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this is that sam'l is all</font>

382
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,170
or nothing right when once I have issued

383
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,550
the token and authenticated to the

384
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:24,589
application the application knows i'm

385
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:26,209
logged in keeps me logged in and allows

386
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,540
me access for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> duration of that</font>

387
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,120
session but if that application contains

388
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,490
multiple levels of data in it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

389
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,020
to say grant<font color="#CCCCCC"> me access to sensitive or</font>

390
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,410
simple things but not access to

391
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,490
sensitive things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to rely on the</font>

392
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,010
application so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would need to do</font>

393
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that most applications don't so in those</font>

394
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,760
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to redirect people through</font>

395
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:50,360
a proxy and rely on the proxy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enforce</font>

396
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,900
those limitations so that's where we are

397
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let me let me kind of so this</font>

398
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,660
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's not an ideal design</font>

399
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,890
right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case my proxy still needs</font>

400
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand a lot of the internals of</font>

401
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,270
the application and if the application

402
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,159
behind the proxy changes its design

403
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:08,930
changes its URL scheme it gets ugly so

404
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,910
let's demo those things and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talk</font>

405
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:15,980
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it took to get them working</font>

406
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:19,250
and this is really where your advice on

407
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,290
what to do differently would would be be

408
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,930
very relevant so why did I build things

409
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,190
myself in any way well first of all like

410
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,690
anything you're gonna build you have to

411
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,160
understand the flow I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

412
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,710
how all these pieces work together and

413
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,310
I'm a bottoms-up thinker that means i

414
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:37,130
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see things built out turn on</font>

415
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,460
chrome developer console really watch it

416
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:43,460
happen to understand what's going on but

417
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">I am a security engineer i am not a</font>

418
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,570
developer first and foremost and that

419
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,080
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ease of getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started is</font>

420
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:53,330
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to stand up things that</font>

421
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,000
will fit well<font color="#E5E5E5"> into my development</font>

422
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:59,330
ecosystem and unfortunately a lot of

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,830
these tools assume that you have a lot

424
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're going to integrate with so</font>

425
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,330
your own ad infrastructure your own MFA

426
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,379
infrastructure

427
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,199
your own configuration management

428
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,640
database I don't want to pick one vendor

429
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,370
I need to understand how those pieces

430
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,680
fit together and so being able to easily

431
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,600
get started with both an individual

432
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,520
component and a whole end-to-end off

433
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,709
infrastructure that already exists is

434
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,090
really important to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the last one</font>

435
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,700
this is where a lot of security tools

436
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,320
are weak today and I think I'm not the

437
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,450
first person so weak this this

438
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,590
conference to say it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I'm</font>

439
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to put this thing into production</font>

440
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:36,080
it can't be manually<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up it can't be</font>

441
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:39,229
manually run I have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to have a</font>

442
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,659
dev a QA in a prod instance I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

443
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to manage this thing through api's</font>

444
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,220
and configuration throughout its life

445
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,030
cycle and so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of tools</font>

446
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,280
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to reject from</font>

447
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,350
consideration just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

448
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,389
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit these criteria and that meant</font>

449
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,389
I wrote some stuff and reuse some other

450
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:59,690
stuff so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at that that</font>

451
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,760
sam'l thing the basic test and issuance

452
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,320
of those assertions and some of the

453
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,750
gotchas that that came with writing

454
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,060
writing that into a Django application

455
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:11,600
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant to some stuff we do on</font>

456
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:16,310
site and now is where I figure out where

457
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,949
this multi-monitor setup works so all

458
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:25,899
right looks like let's switch to mirror

459
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:25,900
desktops and see if this works nope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

460
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:41,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so do that here and often</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dup</font>

461
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:44,780
staring at the big screen and make that

462
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">was really simple two things again</font>

463
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,270
running in a docker container primarily

464
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,710
here we have a Django application that's

465
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,270
going to consume sam'l assertions and

466
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,640
make some interesting decisions based on

467
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,670
what's in them as well as the database

468
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,620
required to run that remember one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

469
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,340
requirements as getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and running</font>

470
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,899
is really quick getting value is quick

471
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,240
being able to deploy multiple copies of

472
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,800
this is quick and easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font>

473
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,890
pattern of having as much possible

474
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,980
running in Dockers is pretty relevant to

475
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,980
me

476
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:36,889
HTTP us for today's demo so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Django's</font>

477
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,110
model is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> user centric and it's one</font>

478
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,300
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that that makes life</font>

479
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,620
difficult for me right I have details<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

480
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,399
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sam'l session oh I'm actually</font>

481
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:55,580
already logged in since i am going to

482
00:20:46,400 --> 00:21:01,670
work well<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not nope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so the</font>

483
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:03,169
thing so logged out of the IDP the

484
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,150
session is still here so it's a little

485
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:08,420
bit out of date but that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be</font>

486
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:13,220
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my point effectively um so</font>

487
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:16,910
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the things that came out of no</font>

488
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:20,810
let's do it this way sorry start up a

489
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:23,200
new chrome<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's should actually do it</font>

490
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,200
for me

491
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,390
ok

492
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:45,300
there we go so anonymous sign in does

493
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,280
the redirect to my to my identity

494
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,899
provider identity providers mine right

495
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,990
it's hosted in my infrastructure it's

496
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:57,510
not hosted in it's not the app it's not

497
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:59,460
owned by the application redirect back

498
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,890
and now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all of these information</font>

499
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,860
about what I am those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are now</font>

500
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,950
stored in the session they're not stored

501
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the user and why that's a problem for</font>

502
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">me is is that some critical features</font>

503
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to implement and</font>

504
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,830
Django all of these models this is staff

505
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a superuser thing i would like to</font>

506
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,780
restrict these to only be done from

507
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,130
secure devices and<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow on site right but</font>

508
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,580
it's within an application so I'm

509
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:31,830
reliant on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Django's model which is</font>

510
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,500
normally tied to a user as a super user

511
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,210
or a user is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a super user and so the</font>

512
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,750
traditional way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage this pattern</font>

513
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,280
is to create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Zelman</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> account that</font>

514
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:46,200
is not a super user in a second one

515
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,580
Aaron<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zelman sa who is but then I'd</font>

516
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,490
still have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write policy that</font>

517
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,110
restricts the Aaron Zelman sa account to

518
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,660
be used from certain locations and

519
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:58,169
certain devices I do have code that gets

520
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:02,370
around this and if I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to power</font>

521
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:04,470
points it kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this happy</font>

522
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,149
to share with with anyone all open

523
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,520
source it in the next couple weeks I

524
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,620
hope but it requires me to do Jackie

525
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,330
things that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like doing so I</font>

526
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,770
actually had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write my own user</font>

527
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,679
middleware for Django I don't know if

528
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,910
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are Django people but a</font>

529
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,710
middleware something that processes

530
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,830
every request and changes the state of

531
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,810
the application so i wrote my own user

532
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,600
object i wrote my own<font color="#CCCCCC"> samuel middleware</font>

533
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:29,010
and it really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> catches all is super</font>

534
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,800
user calls and checks them against the

535
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:35,310
value of the session it is super hacky<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

536
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,690
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like doing this but if the</font>

537
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,700
alternative is writing my own

538
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,380
authentication model from scratch I'd

539
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,960
rather shim the one that exists it's

540
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,520
more likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to be deployed</font>

541
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,580
into the applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

542
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,990
have then if I have to ask every

543
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,649
development team that's written a django

544
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,040
app

545
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:58,220
to rewrite their application with a new

546
00:23:52,040 --> 00:24:01,950
model for<font color="#CCCCCC"> role based access control so</font>

547
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:04,290
that's sort of 11 pain we ran into

548
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:08,970
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement this model where the</font>

549
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:13,490
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses uses its own malin and</font>

550
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:15,990
as tying permissions to the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

551
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:18,660
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing i said i would demo is the</font>

552
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:23,580
app proxy flow so here we built some

553
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:25,710
stuff out in in using engine X using

554
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shibboleth using again these same tools</font>

555
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:33,090
that are used for building building

556
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:35,310
integrations with with with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's</font>

557
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">on site and scaling them scaling them</font>

558
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:42,260
out but now we're adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

559
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:44,850
respect for a little bit of respect for

560
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,230
for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these extra assertions and</font>

561
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,300
deciding what we're going to do and so

562
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm able to implement it as part of my</font>

563
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:54,090
engine ex-con file this is not as

564
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,070
scalable or as useful as one of the

565
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">patterns that for instance the wso guy</font>

566
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:00,470
was talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about where there's these</font>

567
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:05,820
languages for extensible access control

568
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:07,320
called exact mole you know that's the

569
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,570
direction I'd like to go but today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

570
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,419
literally writing filtering request URL

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:15,629
filtering code based on certain

572
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,450
locations in engine<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xcode and at least</font>

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">it gives me something where I'm able to</font>

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,550
applications without modifying the

577

application itself so how does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

578
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:41,399
demo this is another another set of

579
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:48,510
dockers right so three<font color="#E5E5E5"> three components</font>

580
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:51,650
to this application three components

581
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:53,850
this application right so there's the

582
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,860
doctor or sue there's the doctor that

583
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,330
runs the proxy which is engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> X there's</font>

584
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,219
a doctor that's running<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shibboleth which</font>

585
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:02,340
is an SP and there's a doctor that's

586
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,420
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> an appt back end application and</font>

587
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,889
because

588
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,230
for these demos I actually like to kind

589
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,760
of expose the meat of how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

590
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,760
working in hopes that you guys learn the

591
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,180
same way I do let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and bring</font>

592
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">up another thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you the</font>

593
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:25,860
world's simplest application so normally

594
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would run my application behind a</font>

595
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,679
firewall so that I can't forge headers

596
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,000
to it but today I'll show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you again the</font>

597
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,420
world's simplest application all I'm

598
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing is exposing the headers that this</font>

599
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:41,040
application gets to show that back end

600
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,730
applications don't need to be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart</font>

601
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:47,790
to show the back in applications don't

602
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:51,180
need to understand sam'l don't need to

603
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,560
understand Oh auth to consume things if

604
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,240
there's a proxy in front of them that's

605
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,639
doing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

606
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,980
and passing them tokens or details about

607
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,890
the authentication so rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than access</font>

608
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,350
that directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll go through the proxy</font>

609
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:07,220
which is running on localhost 443 and

610
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:10,919
you can see this whole flow

611
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:14,490
theoretically all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right tell you what</font>

612
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,700
we're going to reboot everything demo

613
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,700
gods

614
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,540
starting those three applications takes

615
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,430
15 seconds part of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

616
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:36,930
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about in building building a</font>

617
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:38,130
project there we go and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

618
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,870
the first thing it's going to do against

619
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,060
because this is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I do I've</font>

620
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">done this it's asking me hey are you</font>

621
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you want to send your device</font>

622
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,760
certificate to this proxy because it's

623
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top medicate you is</font>

624
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,879
this the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> one yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um redirects me</font>

625
00:27:50,970 --> 00:28:01,110
to the IDP IDP is going to once again

626
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:02,400
ask me for username and password IDP

627
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,050
does the second check on my device

628
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,240
certificate right because I want the

629
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,740
same device that was doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> login to</font>

630
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">be the one that's being checked at the</font>

631
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,650
the API gateway and my back and

632
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,570
application now gets i'm doing the

633
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,550
import I can do enforcement either at

634
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,610
the proxy and also pass details back to

635
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,470
the back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> application so you may be</font>

636
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,510
familiar with this pattern again if your

637
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,270
django developers or if you've deployed

638
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">fluncan SSO mode or JIRA and SSO mode</font>

639
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,980
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very common pattern that my</font>

640
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,320
proxy puts a header called remote user

641
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,570
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend application says oh</font>

642
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the username I accept it traffic</font>

643
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,850
came from the trusted proxy IP address

644
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:43,320
therefore therefore I will allow this to

645
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,360
proceed the user doesn't have to login I

646
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,030
trust the value in that header but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

647
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,709
limitations to this are it's just a user

648
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,570
name right it's the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

649
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,820
pattern that I want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from</font>

650
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,700
where I'm making application decisions

651
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,530
are making making<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-end decisions I</font>

652
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,170
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make those decisions based on</font>

653
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:04,010
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user and in this case sort</font>

654
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,720
of as promised<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have sort of a you know</font>

655
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,129
any normal locations get through but the

656
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,700
ones that are designated for on-site

657
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,380
only are going to give me a 403 because

658
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,120
my and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeanette proxy is blocking that</font>

659
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,640
not because the application is smart the

660
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,850
application is profoundly dumb in this

661
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,850
case

662
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:34,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh so yeah so yeah so so those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

663
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,389
demos basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VI again showing</font>

664
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:38,580
that we're kind of at this place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

665
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:42,090
we're starting to make much more

666
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:45,720
granular access decisions and as I do

667
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,730
this as applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> are shown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to either</font>

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,220

669
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:54,809
manage them this way or at their shown

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward manner proxy that allows me</font>

672
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:03,240
application developers for my in-house

673
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:05,519
applications to to refactor their

674
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,970
applications to understand these<font color="#E5E5E5"> special</font>

675
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:12,119
assertions or I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure the rules</font>

676
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,529
within my identity provider and have the

677
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,749
enterprise applications the SAS

678
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:18,929
applications that I work with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font>

679
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:23,549
from understand these restrictions and

680
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:24,840
not allow people to use them if the they

681
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:29,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't respect my session timeouts and</font>

682
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,080
Salem tokens I'm actually able to give

683
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,639
my developers and my users much more

684
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,080
freedom let them operate outside the

685
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:39,769
walls let them operate from devices that

686
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,678
have a little bit of less control

687
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:46,169
because I know and have confidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

688
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,549
even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device is secure is less</font>

689
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:50,580
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if the location they're</font>

690
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:52,168
coming from is less secure I can limit

691
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,470
them only to those applications that are

692
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:59,639
appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the their current</font>

693
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:03,330
security posture so where are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we what's</font>

694
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:06,330
left I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of at</font>

695
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:08,279
this nebulous proof of concept shown

696
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,840
which shown it for two applications but

697
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,909
not really everything in my enterprise

698
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,320
space because at least Google's been out

699
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:15,149
this for two or three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they've</font>

700
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,759
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time and more people to throw</font>

701
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it the problem but you know clearly</font>

702
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:25,379
there's a lot left for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

703
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:28,789
here the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I pick the</font>

704
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:33,480
right model for my rules and attributes

705
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:34,799
so I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay device status is going to</font>

706
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,590
have an enumeration it's going to be

707
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,480
either compliant

708
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,449
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be known or it's going to</font>

709
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:45,820
be unknown and then i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

710
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:47,620
rules based on that it would be nice to

711
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,149
write those rules once so tie them to

712
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,908
the trust tears right the more sensitive

713
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,610
the application the more compliant the

714
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:58,179
device has to be now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm implementing</font>

715
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:01,510
those rules in a hodgepodge<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Shem code</font>

716
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:03,490
within Django and shim code within

717
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,799
proxies it'd be nice to write them in

718
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,289
business logic like exact mole but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

719
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,820
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> public project I could find for</font>

720
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:11,740
exact mole was an Apache incubation

721
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:16,960
project called open AZ which was

722
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:18,970
discontinued and well /<font color="#E5E5E5"> bath from wso2</font>

723
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,820
pointed me at another one about an hour

724
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:25,899
ago it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know his project so that's</font>

725
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,490
helpful one project is does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

726
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:30,279
ecosystem make so I am a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

727
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:35,470
worried is exact mold a tool to build on

728
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:37,720
yeah okay uh yeah Oh a thermo profile so

729
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:47,350
I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that so I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

730
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:49,570
them yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so cool yeah so you know</font>

731
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,908
so the whole sort of OAuth eco something

732
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:56,559
probably been working on for only two

733
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:59,230
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months at this point and so you</font>

734
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,470
know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authentication of users</font>

735
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:05,440
and basic authorization we can do that

736
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,120
it's naturally<font color="#CCCCCC"> works really well with</font>

737
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,840
things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already very API driven</font>

738
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,000
a lot of the applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to port</font>

739
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,439
and protect our more web driven and more

740
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,940
driven to the sam'l flow so I put my

741
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:21,549
energy there first definitely sort of

742
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,809
the next next month or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two as I get back</font>

743
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:24,429
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to spend a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more time</font>

744
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:29,020
sort of looking at looking at that

745
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:31,419
implementation yeah and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

746
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,879
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good about this device cert</font>

747
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:38,230
pattern it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar to how</font>

748
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,909
Google is working but and still not

749
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,289
great UX and there's still a lot of

750
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:43,860
management overhead with dealing with

751
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that particularly well if anyone's done</font>

752
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">new particularly interesting work with</font>

753
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vice fingerprinting I'd be</font>

754
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,870
interested to hear that right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I see it</font>

755
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,850
with

756
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:55,659
things like google and facebook login

757
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:57,219
that that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it recognizes a new</font>

758
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,900
device now admittedly that's just like

759
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,120
lack of presence of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> session cookie or</font>

760
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,740
a device cookie but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognizes the</font>

761
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,409
device or class of devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not</font>

used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me working from it throws</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up an</font>

763
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,000
extra auth pattern and code for

764
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:15,520
integrating that into my<font color="#E5E5E5"> workflow would</font>

765
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,860
be really helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and then a lot</font>

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one of the tools that's a lot of</font>

768
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,000

luckily does speak o auth so<font color="#CCCCCC"> integration</font>

771
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,049
patterns with those types of things

772
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:35,050
short-lived API creds and bootstrapping

773
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:37,780
are things that I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out as</font>

774
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:41,530
we build that kind of the API fully API

775
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,330
version of this thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>
