20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,210
been awesome being in the security

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
industry doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different things</font>

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I started off my career working</font>

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,659
for the NSA doing more information

24
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,908
warfare cryptography analysis signal

25
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,009
breaking all that good stuff and got out

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,899
and I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break things a lot and</font>

27
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,390
what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great is being on the offensive</font>

28
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:19,740
side I walk into<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and I destroy</font>

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,060
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know figure out you know</font>

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,380
all the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were wrong with them</font>

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,090
and then I became<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chief security</font>

32
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,460
officer for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortune 1000 company</font>

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">diebold came in after the voting</font>

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,970
machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was like to throw that out</font>

35
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,889
there um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for Diebold and I</font>

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,270
finally recognized the reason why it was

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,439
so challenging to fix a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

38
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,839
issues that have come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in year four year</font>

39
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,250
to go in smash and grab so today's talks

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,960
really to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little about that and</font>

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what we do what we can do is an</font>

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,500
industry to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better but I do</font>

43
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,990
some work on mr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> robots so if you've</font>

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,460
seen the TV show like season 1 episode 5

45
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,060
they use the social engineer toolkit

46
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,798
that spoof a text message to from the

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,590
person that was in steel<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mountain to get</font>

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to the level and season 2 episode</font>

49
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,450
1 they used the social engineer toolkit

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,829
the deploy crypt a wall and stuff like

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,060
that and it's funny because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

52
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,740
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to like Christian Slater</font>

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,420
and all those other folks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,459
like totally paranoid about representing

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,929
and being hackers like the terrified of

56
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,220
us like they're like hey can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you offer</font>

57
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,510
some protection I'm like man it doesn't

58
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,650
work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

59
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,989
mm-hmm it's pretty funny they're like

60
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,480
literally terrified of us and it's funny

61
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that you know the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show has a lot</font>

62
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,450
of accurate representation of what we

63
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,920
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in hacking and that terrifies</font>

64
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,420
them even more that this gets there

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,619
actually pretending to do or actually

66
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,569
like legitimate stuff that you can

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,120
actively go and do so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always a</font>

68
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,000
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun and I was have the title of</font>

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,129
one of the world's sexiest men alive so

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,540
it's not photoshopped so if you don't

71
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the story behind this I was on the</font>

72
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,700
Katie Couric show and they had a up next

73
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,659
thing it said up next one of the world's

74
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,890
sexiest men alive and I was talking

75
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:48,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">about Benedict cumberpatch but they</font>

76
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,369
removed the up next for like I got half

77
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,230
a second or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

78
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,609
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course all the friends all my friends</font>

79
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,858
on the internet made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> go viral and</font>

80
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,930
everything else out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but I think</font>

81
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,549
it's true you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna not</font>

82
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,079
gonna think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to say</font>

83
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:03,780
something there hey that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> smirk and</font>

84
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,829
everything it's great but you know

85
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,569
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting about this talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

86
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,129
the reason why I giving it is you know

87
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,480
in this industry there's so many

88
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,040
different demographics there's

89
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,690
application security which is why we're

90
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
here today and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in application</font>

91
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,150
secure there's mobile security there's

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,099
web app security there's a whole bunch

93
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other things out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there that make up</font>

94
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,760
this industry everything from exploit

95
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,168
research to defense you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know being on</font>

96
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,060
the blue team being on the red team

97
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,260
being on the purple team and so you have

98
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these different things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all</font>

99
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,698
searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best way to to fix our</font>

100
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,440
individual niche our area that we're

101
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,079
dealing with we still haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

102
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,699
yet you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of things</font>

103
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there being touted as as you know</font>

104
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,389
being kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sure all in fact I was</font>

105
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming through the airport on last night</font>

106
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,889
and I saw this and I we can all go home

107
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,989
now where we fixed the internet

108
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,220
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh that's Barracuda has a web</font>

109
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,949
application firewall that says goodbye

110
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,989
data breaches so we can all leave now

111
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,370
and go home but what's interesting about

112
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,290
it is you know you see a lot of these

113
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologies out there pouting and</font>

114
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,798
offering a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that they don't</font>

115
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily do and a lot of this you</font>

116
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,489
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

117
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,530
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes from a lot of user interface</font>

118
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,359
design and how we actively go out and go

119
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,859
after attackers and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you</font>

120
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,329
some demonstrations about how easy it is

121
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:10,799
to break in the corporation's based off

122
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,049
of design features and good one is I

123
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,549
actually gave his presentation at just

124
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,829
just yesterday at blue hat it's a

125
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,019
modified<font color="#E5E5E5"> version but I was explaining to</font>

126
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,130
Microsoft like hey the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we're</font>

127
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,418
able to break in your stuff isn't

128
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,560
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your protection mechanisms</font>

129
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,450
you have some great stuff with you

130
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,099
notify scarred and a SLR and dep and

131
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,370
everything else it's how you present in

132
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,440
for me

133
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,940
to the user like hey do you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

134
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,350
this up to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to view the site well</font>

135
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,820
yeah I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open this up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

136
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,130
site but if you hit open it compromises

137
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,419
your whole computer so it's a UI design

138
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,370
issue when it comes to the ease of

139
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,109
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we give our users and</font>

140
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,960
everything else does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody here have</font>

141
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,100
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android device take it take it put on</font>

142
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the table real quick just put on the</font>

143
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:52,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right everybody got on table</font>

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,440
alright so this video yesterday and

145
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:58,320
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the pixel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you probably</font>

146
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,460
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this hey this is Dave um</font>

147
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,560
just got the new google pixel XL and it

148
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,229
has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> google assistant feature on it</font>

149
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,389
and been playing around with it so far

150
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">our phones awesome however it looks like</font>

151
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,880
you can easily bypass the biometric

152
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,020
reader by simply just using the

153
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,250
assistant and launching it here's an

154
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:24,590
example notice my phone is completely

155
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:30,270
locked at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to unlock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

156
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:35,520
nothing here notice i met<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen can't log</font>

157
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:43,349
in right can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the phone however so</font>

158
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:50,549
again still unlocked<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not great ok</font>

159
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:51,930
Google right into the phone now

160
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,539
interesting enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to host phone just</font>

161
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,729
lit up when they and it happen it's

162
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,320
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll hang on so I know that it's</font>

163
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,479
the voice activation feature on your

164
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,979
phone how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody to</font>

165
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,090
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and Google and two sentences</font>

166
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,650
recorded now by default the big issue

167
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,869
the big security issue with this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

168
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">it comes on by default on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

169
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,740
pixels and all new versions and

170
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,780
variations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android so an interesting</font>

171
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,210
UI design and you have biometric which

172
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,830
is very single to your thumb we also

173
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">have your voice activation which is very</font>

174
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,030
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get somebody to capture ok in</font>

175
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google so they call was it a voice lock</font>

176
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,840
it's under<font color="#E5E5E5"> settings security so if you</font>

177
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,610
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pixel or any new versions tested</font>

178
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,780
I was your voice and turn it off because

179
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,360
it's when you first up the phone and

180
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,580
asked you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say ok Google that's my</font>

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,710
phone just lock it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> its locks slack</font>

182
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,300
huh<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't actually shut it off</font>

183
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,138
so interesting

184
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,000
design so if you look at where we're at

185
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,349
today as an industry technology touted

186
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,270
as artificial intelligence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

187
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:50,370
learning as an interesting concept

188
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,830
because a lot of what we see today from

189
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,970
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the technologies doesn't do a</font>

190
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,859
lot when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes to actually</font>

191
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,659
prohibiting what we do is attack us on

192
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,699
the offensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> side when i run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into new</font>

193
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:01,979
next-generation type of software

194
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,930
technology it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually very trivial to</font>

195
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,580
get around a good example is there's a

196
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,449
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there that touts you know</font>

197
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,800
machine learning and artificial

198
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,629
intelligence<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won't say which one it is</font>

199
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,669
or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might your name bashing</font>

200
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,199
your vendor bashing or anything um but

201
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:14,549
you know most of time we do pen test

202
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,500
against a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of technology</font>

203
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have no idea it's even there we've</font>

204
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
got me get da get access to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

205
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,940
creds you know we extract all their

206
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,159
passwords and everything else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

207
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,650
still have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that technology's</font>

208
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:27,780
there but yet you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have executives that</font>

209
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">walk out to an airport and say hey they</font>

210
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,479
you notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought breaches or i can</font>

211
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,340
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-nine percent of the hackers</font>

212
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,840
or hey are you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be hacked</font>

213
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,520
next and all the different type of

214
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,310
marketing fear that we see out there so

215
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">a market really driven off of fear</font>

216
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,610
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

217
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,840
help with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do today but</font>

218
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't solve all the issues we face</font>

219
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean if you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just what happened</font>

220
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">last week or the week before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Miriah we</font>

221
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,989
have friggin toasters that are literally

222
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,940
causing you know internet outages with

223
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,009
our DNS providers I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else</font>

224
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have out there if you look at a</font>

225
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the symptoms a lot of these come</font>

226
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,409
down to fundamental security practices

227
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,360
everything from ransomware I mean

228
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,520
ransomware the technique that we've been

229
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">using since like when I was a kid on AOL</font>

230
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,729
having people going<font color="#E5E5E5"> download an</font>

231
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,860
executable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and infecting their machines</font>

232
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:09,090
right I never did that but if someone

233
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,150
were to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that it's how you would do it</font>

234
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,068
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the 90s right and so you know</font>

235
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,539
ransomware is an issue because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

236
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,069
at what companies are doing they're

237
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,449
still allowing unsigned executables

238
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,310
because we have no bass lines in our

239
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,509
environments they're allowing executors

240
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,190
from temp directories<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of other</font>

241
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,330
locations things that we've known have

242
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,039
been problematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that malware</font>

243
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,109
researchers have done for four years of

244
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,120
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing is the</font>

245
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,909
exact same issue I love this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cartoon</font>

246
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,560
hopefully folks have seen it but hey we

247
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,819
have all this technology in one corner

248
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,468
which is you know what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend all of</font>

249
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,120
our millions of dollars on and then we

250
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,649
have Dave in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other corner right and</font>

251
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,240
Dave's human error right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

252
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:43,979
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole downfall of our entire</font>

253
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization of everything that we see</font>

254
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,310
today and all the different breaches

255
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
that we see an applications are

256
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,160
definitely still a wave of getting

257
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,630
access to things but if I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

258
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,719
have adobe installed or<font color="#CCCCCC"> java installed</font>

259
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">or just micro</font>

260
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,019
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fall by default I know that</font>

261
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's ways for me to actively go and</font>

262
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,550
attack individuals that way based off of

263
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the type of software that they have if</font>

264
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what actually works basic</font>

265
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,680
concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> do work and I want to walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

266
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:08,079
through I'm a specific attack that I did

267
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,719
on CNN and it works really well because

268
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">of how the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user interface is designed</font>

269
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,810
how we're supposed to operate as human

270
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,610
beings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just what is believable</font>

271
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,008
what's not believable<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do is</font>

272
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,079
attackers is not magic it doesn't just

273
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen and we have a zero day and all of</font>

274
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,649
a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works a lot of the sudden we</font>

275
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,540
do is very symptomatic of a larger

276
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,399
problem of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we see in most breaches</font>

277
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,620
look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gaps that we see in</font>

278
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,000
insecurity if you like it kind of looks

279
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,829
like open attack the first thing I do is

280
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,120
an attacker does I'll go to like

281
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:35,829
linkedin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll select one or two</font>

282
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,050
people max like just two people usually

283
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:40,239
just so i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fallback pretext that I</font>

284
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,889
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after and what I usually do is we</font>

285
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
love to brag about ourselves because we

286
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,589
have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

287
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,910
obtained over the few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years so we'll</font>

288
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:47,230
talk about the technologies that we know

289
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,219
especially at the current company are

290
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,170
working in so let's just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

291
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,879
target trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack and in my resume I</font>

292
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,160
say hey I worked on palo alto firewalls

293
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,389
and you know bit9 and carbon black well

294
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know now that I need to get around</font>

295
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit9 in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carbon black and i know i need</font>

296
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,680
to get around palo alto so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just build</font>

297
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,660
my pretext in my attack around that

298
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,339
technology and so I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

299
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,139
profile about what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go after</font>

300
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:06,519
and the individual going after and key

301
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,410
roles if they're at in an organization

302
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,149
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great about you know trying to</font>

303
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,709
find people's email addresses is only

304
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:13,209
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that you ever have to</font>

305
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,029
worry about an email address I'm never

306
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:18,609
being leaked as if so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> back up a</font>

307
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,079
second so<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody in your a few if</font>

308
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,420
you google<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company name in ad</font>

309
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,739
address in google will you find one

310
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,089
person that has probably leaked your

311
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,110
email address at one period of time

312
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:32,290
right just one or more so what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

313
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,480
one email address tell me the format

314
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so is it first out last name or</font>

315
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,959
first initial last name or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

316
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,430
else that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I go to LinkedIn</font>

317
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,199
and I find the specific profile that I

318
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,579
want and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> peace the first name and</font>

319
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,779
last name together<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email</font>

320
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,489
address the title and all their

321
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,959
experience that they've ever used plus

322
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,189
to find them at social media things that

323
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,290
they're doing is usually pretty easy as

324
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,849
well so you start to build a profile off

325
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,160
of the specific attacks that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

326
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,990
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually do so that that phase is</font>

327
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,300
very difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect because i'm</font>

328
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,829
using open source intelligence after

329
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that end go and buy or build a tool or</font>

330
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:03,008
whatever I want to do ought to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

331
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it by an exploit kit for two or three</font>

332
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,930
nor bucks on the internet that

333
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,810
for me um and then the part that we have

334
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,969
the toughest time to detect is that

335
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,739
initial intrusion if our end point

336
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,180
software isn't good enough that the

337
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,250
detect what we're actively going and

338
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,599
doing we have an issue there because if

339
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,829
we don't detect the initial command

340
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,120
control infrastructure everything else

341
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:23,099
after that usually goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the window</font>

342
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,990
lateral movement persistence hooks

343
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,860
getting access to the type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data we</font>

344
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">have all these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

345
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,699
technologies like dlp and you know sims

346
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,829
in everything but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a massive</font>

347
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,760
massive project have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in</font>

348
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:33,989
most the time we know that they're there

349
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,149
so we don't like sit there and try to

350
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,170
add a domain admin to your Active

351
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,029
Directory infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font>

352
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,219
you look for stuff like that right so we

353
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:42,689
try other methods of going after<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

354
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,269
organization's so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't detect</font>

355
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,800
the initial entry point into a ended the

356
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:48,930
initial intrusion into the

357
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,910
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that at that point in</font>

358
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,399
time you're pretty much going blind so

359
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,230
the next next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide is a when I did on</font>

360
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,060
CNN and what was funny about this one is

361
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,360
I've done a few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them</font>

362
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,649
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even air</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was so bad so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so one</font>

363
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,149
of the producers like hey I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

364
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,199
hack into my boss my producer and we're

365

404
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:12,300
to be at in social engineering because

00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:13,469
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need the person to do</font>

406
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,599
what you need them to do and if they're

407
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,009
annoyed or agitated

408
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,870
you have a good chance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> em hanging up</font>

409

on you so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to put them up what we</font>

460
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,089
was interesting here's here's one I did

461
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,610
now what's interesting but this one here

462
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,990
is when you do social<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering you</font>

463
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,610
know you can take advantage of an

464
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,990
exploit but exports are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font>

465
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,010
because you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the environment</font>

466
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going after you know what</font>

467
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,980
versions of an operating system they're

468
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,750
running you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they running</font>

469
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,100
Windows 10 do I get to I got to get

470
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">around a lot of protection mechanisms</font>

471
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,699
using UAC blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah a whole bunch</font>

472
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:12,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">of things that go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into you going after</font>

473
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific organizations but what's nice</font>

474
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,390
is we can take advantage of how an

475
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:17,399
operating system is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to</font>

476
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,839
work by defaults then you're all set so

477
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,180
this attack vector that I using this one

478
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,680
is what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> call an HT a tack it's a old</font>

479
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,849
extension that has been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

480
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,750
forever I mean there's like actually

481
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,490
like a book in like nineteen

482
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-seven it's one of those like old</font>

483
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,089
color books like<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine hundred pages long</font>

484
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a guy about hacking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's like</font>

485
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,140
one Linus it's like HTM you know met

486
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's our super awesome to hack and you</font>

487
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,079
can literally hack anybody you want see

488
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,459
through HTS and like 19 I need seven or

489
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,229
whatever and so it still works today

490
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,149
which is great and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens is you</font>

491
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,410
just trigger an HD a file and it says do

492
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,760
you want to owe this in order for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

493
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,709
site to work or operate you need to open

494
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">this HDFS kind like a java applet it</font>

495
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,589
looks like it's signed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font>

496
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,199
which is awesome so does anybody going

497
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ever click open like everybody it's</font>

open right everybody and<font color="#CCCCCC"> India full</font>

499
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,390

500
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,589
an exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything else what's</font>

501
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,230
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is I went after a</font>

502
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:04,170
help desk and help desk design is to do

503
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,839
what whatever help desk there for the

504
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,579
help right so you call help desk and you

505
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,949
use them in the capacity that they're

506
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,180
designed to operate with and so you know

507
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,709
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing things like changing</font>

508
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,880
passwords which require them to trigger

509
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,959
something in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say oh I need to</font>

510
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,699
challenge you because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

use a challenge those you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do</font>

515
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,400
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that you just take</font>

516
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,470
advantage of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're designed to do</font>

517
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,170
as a role same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for human resources</font>

as they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get the sale</font>

521
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,880
especially if they're the

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,490
social skills they have more social

534

643

independent computer cuz I'm like man

person in the world come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> her house</font>

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,600
computer consultant who comes into my

648
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,789
home to check on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

649
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,500

650
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,289
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and</font>

651
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,210
protect myself and my daughters I mean

652
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,010
it's something that's really worrisome

653
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,169
for me well that that's very impressive

654
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,200
because you seem like you're extremely

655
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:05,350
ahead of the curve so we decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

656
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">David to the test to see if your comfort</font>

657
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,750
level with your security is actually

658
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:13,770
warranted tell us what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened how did</font>

659
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,870
you do when we gave you the challenge of

660
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,039
face says it all computer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

661
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,959
Stephanie I would say it was actually

662
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,360
one of the top 5% of what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is</font>

663
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,010
being most secure you know everything up

664
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,439
to date really<font color="#E5E5E5"> locked down all those</font>

665
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,789
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and so I literally had</font>

666
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,010
plugged in opened my computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and</font>

667
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:32,320
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes or so had a fully</font>

668
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,640
designed website that looked real in

669
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,870
every way and shape or form of a website

670
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you would visit every single day</font>

671
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,979
and I sent an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email out and as soon as I</font>

672
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:41,470
sent the email looks very believable in

673
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,299
every way she clicked<font color="#CCCCCC"> a link and then</font>

674
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there again less than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes of</font>

675
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,059
setup time and hacking and all that

676
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,059
stuff had full access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to her computer</font>

677
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:51,158
her webcam got around Oliver antivirus

678
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:55,270
everything completely you are kidding me

679
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:57,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wow so tell us oh my gosh that you were</font>

680
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,010
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see well the first thing we did</font>

681
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,240
is we enabled her that's my we enabled

682
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,100
her webcam we were actually able to

683
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,539
monitor everything I was going on in her

684
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,789
house everything from her daughter I'll

685
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:07,658
working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer it's a Stephanie</font>

686
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking through the house</font>

687
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,380
itself we actually enabled the audio as

688
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,970
well so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually hear everything</font>

689
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,289
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time I'll</font>

690
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak and listen to copy it gets worse a</font>

691
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:18,999
little about that but

692
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,409
[Applause]

693
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:22,729
you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my head I'm like yeah I'm</font>

694
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:23,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">the awesome hacker and i'm looking at</font>

695
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:29,419
i'm like oh I'm such a horrible person

696
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:31,309
hey don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it hey there but</font>

697
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:33,289
anything's believable you know as long

698
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you craft something that is legit so</font>

699
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:36,619
like a good example is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> person social</font>

700
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:38,869
engineering is also great once this is

701
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:40,879
weird an in-person social engineer and

702
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:42,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is one of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys we nicknamed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

703
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:45,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">Biebs kind of looks like Justin Bieber</font>

704
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,449
and so we'd say Biebs go out and dress a

705
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:49,218
security guard and say hey you know our

706
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,749
security system isn't working can you

707
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:52,249
just you know can I your badge number

708
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:53,509
down and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it verify you know</font>

709
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:55,729
I'll buzz you in or whatever doesn't

710
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:56,839
actually buzz her in mini right sir

711
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:58,249
badge number down and then she's like

712
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I can I see your badge well he</font>

713
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,189
actually she takes the badge off and

714
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:03,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">hanes assume we have a proxmark and the</font>

715
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:05,109
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clones are her badge</font>

716
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:08,029
and then we can walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the building</font>

717
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:09,589
so you know as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you have somewhat</font>

718
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:10,669
of a believable story<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will always</font>

719
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,809
believe what you're doing and that's the

720
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:13,729
great part about social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

721
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:14,809
works so effectively so you know she

722
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:16,609
takes her badge off and now we have

723
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,158
excess<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that now it's great as we walk</font>

724
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:26,869
into the building with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're just</font>

725
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:28,459
actually walking into the building what

726
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:32,208
is it just or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dress up and</font>

727
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:34,389
put balloons and pretend someone has a

728
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:34,389
birthday

729
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:39,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">you walk into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the building let's walk</font>

730
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:47,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">right past the balloons are blocking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

731
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:50,320
view this is one once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did at Derby</font>

732
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:55,119
con got permission from the hyatt to go

733
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,739
and do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use e-cigarettes</font>

734
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,089
in May here smoke smoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> e-cigarette</font>

735
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that you can use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

736
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:00,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">like pretty much get into any building</font>

737
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:02,019
you want to just by blowing smoke

738
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:05,369
through the cracks of the door because

739
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:05,369
it triggers their rec sensor on the top

740
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:13,839
so there's a sensor<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the top there and</font>

741
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:16,149
it's a they look for motion so detects

742
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,789
motion and serum was blowing cigarette

743
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:24,279
smoke to it or e cig smoke and it opens

744
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:25,389
the door for you or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just use</font>

745
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,949
whiskey this is all one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my good</font>

746
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:29,109
friends deviant<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next one here</font>

747
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:30,699
deviant uh I was walking down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the street</font>

748
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:37,198
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw one of these open and he's</font>

749
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:42,959
awesome at physicals would so relax

750
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:42,959
right there's a wreck sensor up there

751
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:58,300
well right I mean this yeah I was funny

752
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,410
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecig one is the first thing we</font>

753
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,700
were trying it we got permission<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

754
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,130
the hyatt to go and do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was the</font>

755
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,110
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> where all the cooks are at and so</font>

756
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,280
I'm blowing like II cigarette smoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

757
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,080
that one of the guys from a high to sit

758
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,610
next to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> giggling and laughing and I</font>

759
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,110
open it up and the whole room is like

760
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,030
full of<font color="#E5E5E5"> smoke right and there was like</font>

761
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,350
three cooks there like looking at me

762
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,300
like all like terrified because your

763
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,280
smoke literally coming through the walls

764
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,340
and the whole rooms full of smoke so I'm

765
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:25,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh just pretending it didn't happen</font>

766
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,919
you're close the door slowly but you

767
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,970
look at what happened what happens today

768
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,710
humans continue to be our most

769
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,330
challenging Avenue and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

770
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,880
have to develop a lot of our apps around

771
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,949
that to understand that humans will do

772
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,240
that i mean the funny part is not funny

773
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,130
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not everybody is a nerd when it</font>

774
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,480
comes to security good example is my

775
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,790
grandma called me up about two weeks ago

776
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,110
and she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey Dave um you'd be</font>

777
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">proud of me I'm Michael would you do</font>

778
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,919
grandma you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very tech savvy</font>

779
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:49,540
she's like oh the microsoft guy called

780
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">me and said my antivirus on a date so i</font>

781
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,240
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to work with him and give him</font>

782
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,380
access to my computer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I gave</font>

783
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,550
him my credit card and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ain't got the</font>

784
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,010
whole new antivirus stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the day I'm</font>

785
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,460
like Grandma you own a mac first of all

786
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,530
I'm like

787
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,000
you don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have windows there's no</font>

788
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:05,149
Microsoft that all on your thing and

789
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,560
she's like oh really I'm IRS can see

790
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,180
your credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> first you know to call</font>

791
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,560
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm the kingpin in our family</font>

792
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,060
you call for technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right you</font>

793
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,770
call me a sad or something wrong right

794
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,750
and she didn't she didn't fortunately

795
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,790
and call me so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

796
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,920
of what we're trying to face right now

797
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,810
in the security industry is the people

798
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,730
piece of it so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at fixing</font>

799
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,230
humans I think it requires three major

800
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,640
things you look at the building blocks

801
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,560
for foundation of it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it comes</font>

802
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,060
down to education but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

803
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,740
different I'll talk about those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here</font>

804
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,629
in just a second the basics and

805
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,460
technology look at education or

806
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,410
typically taught and most of our

807
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,480
companies is the quick ratio a piece of

808
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,280
it so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like a provider</font>

809
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,050
that sent out fishing campaigns and you

810
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,430
go from seventy percent to twenty

811
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,050
percent or thirty percent or forty

812
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,160
percent and you get a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> level that</font>

813
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,840
you're okay with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that you know</font>

814
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">your fishing goes up based off of how</font>

815
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,209
well your fish is or goes down based up

816
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:54,679
how're your fish is those aren't

817
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,830
accurate portrayals because as an

818
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,940
attacker if I create a fantasy that's

819
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,530
really believable you're going to have

820
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,630
one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clicks</font>

821
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,770
that link it's always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen so</font>

822
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,660
your security program has to be designed

823
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,700
to understand that and that it needs to

824
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,230
understand that a person is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

825
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on something hopefully the</font>

826
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,680
education piece gives the person the

827
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,300
ability to communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

828
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,380
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say hey something's messed up</font>

829
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,379
here we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually go and do it</font>

830
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,080
but to me education means training users

831
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,370
on the actual technology itself both

832
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,740
personal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional is that</font>

833
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">diebold the biggest success we had for</font>

834
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,010
having users understand technology is

835
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,449
when we could relate it to them

836
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,980
personally like hey here's how they

837
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure kids Facebook here's how to do</font>

838
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,070
your home Wi-Fi you know that type of

839
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,300
stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand the</font>

840
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,419
reasons why we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing certain things</font>

841
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that had a big impact overall on how</font>

842
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,890
we actively went and did everything so I

843
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,899
huge advocate of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Education when it comes</font>

844
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,270
to you what on people do and how you

845
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,700
actively interact with them the basics

846
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,950
are interesting because most of the

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,600

848
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,700
breaches that we see today doesn't come

849
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,439
from something super sophisticated we

850
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,300
hear a lot about state-sponsored attacks

851
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,860
we hear about Russia hacking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dnc</font>

852
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,419
with zero days and Microsoft and Google

853
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,010
combating because they released a zero

854
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,610
day early and also that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

855
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:10,010
Russia and China also stuff I don't

856
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,419
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last time i had to actively</font>

857
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,990
go and run an exploit against the

858
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,280
company

859
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,809
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't remember</font>

861
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:18,470
since I've had to actually use an expert

862
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,090
to get after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company so we know what</font>

863
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:26,660
the the main method<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still get in to</font>

864
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:29,990
this day ask a password<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some sort</font>

865
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:32,420
like summer 2016 winter 2016 password

866
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,950
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> company name one two three some of</font>

867
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,040
your like I'm changing my password group

868
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,900
quick things that are very predictable

869
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,220
and what's awesome about that is one of

870
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the methods I use for a long time it's</font>

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,410
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very public out there is you could</font>

872
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,210
use Microsoft and even with two factor

873
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:51,500
authentication I'm you could circumvent

874
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,730
it with EWS and so Horry wccp so

875
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially if you have two factor</font>

authentication over here to view 8 you

877

880
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,980
post on this and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally</font>

881
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:06,140
circumvent all two-factor authentication

882
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:08,000
on office 365 as well as exchange owa as

883
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,130
well I mean what was nice about that is

884
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,080
you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise users just</font>

885
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,540
by single factor right and then what you

886
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">could do from there is there's what are</font>

887
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,970
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules within owa and you can push</font>

888
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,679
rules down let's say hey when that

889
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,770
person logs in and opens up outlook<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

890
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,360
want you to push down you know a

891
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,740
powershell script to run that is a back

892
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,689
door into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine and get a shell on</font>

893
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">a machine so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can compromise direct</font>

894
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,100
users through owa just by going through

895
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and using that method as well so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

major major issue but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

897
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,170
that for years what's been great is um

898
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,179
like use likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> linked in data breaches</font>

899
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you just grab a company name and</font>

900
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,520
match that up and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go off for</font>

901
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,899
those users and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after those user</font>

903
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,800
have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two hits off of a company</font>

904
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,360
based off of pass reviews so it's

905
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,159
usually an easy way to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

works on most of Microsoft products a

lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people try to implement</font>

two-factor authentication in their

913
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:05,030
environment like rdp and things like

914
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,190
that right you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the</font>

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,928
lower level programming or low level

916
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,730
protocols like our pc or netbios or

917
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:12,410
nests SMB and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can use instill</font>

918
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,700
authenticate with like PS exec and other

00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,840
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have two factor</font>

authentication editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell</font>

921
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,199
remoting is another good example doesn't

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">have two factor authentication able on</font>

923

it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to circumvent</font>

924

most two-factor authentication solutions

925
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,669
on in environments based off of the

protocols that you're using to

927
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,910
that they go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> run it some of things</font>

928
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,740
that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop me pretty pretty</font>

929
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,750
difficult wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that one group</font>

00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,920
policy on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you could ever implement your entire</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and you put the local ministers group in</font>

935
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,520
there and so what happens is is Bob and

936
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,900
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm Bob and I have really</font>

other workstations machines as admin

944
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:00,020
rare right you might have certain use

945
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,910
cases or edge cases like me of a help

946
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,840
desk you know functionality but you can

947
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,760
put that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there but it's on a local</font>

948
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,689

949
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,879
administrators group to that group

950
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,260
policy and it literally stops<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

951
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,210
the lateral movement stuff that you see

952
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,800
today a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of that is when I</font>

953
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised a machine I get access to</font>

954
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,669
the underlying operating system I

955
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:19,310
extract hash hashes or I'll grab

956
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kerberos tokens or you know grant clear</font>

957
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,190
text passwords out of memory if you have

958
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,780
that enable still and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll use that</font>

959
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">information and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> machines usually</font>

960
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,660
the same on another machine so I just

961
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,890
move from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one machine to other</font>

962
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,110
machine to another machine to<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

963
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if I have a local admin hash it does</font>

964
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,290
me no good with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that group policy</font>

965
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,520
setting I can't move from one machine to

966
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,080
the other because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> denying through</font>

967
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,360
the network so even if I compromise that

968
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,710
one system it really limits what I'm

969
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,350
actually able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do as an attacker</font>

970
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,000
there's also laps I fear not familiar

971
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,860
with that it's a Microsoft tool on it

972
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,110
basically randomizes all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local</font>

973
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,070
accounts on the machines so that you

974
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,990
know in stores them in active directory

975
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,310
so your help desk you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give you</font>

976
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,660
no permission to user group policy to

977
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,190
see those passwords and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> log into</font>

978
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,750
the machines themselves but every

979
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,510
password is completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

account management is still to this day

982
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,580
happens to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> easiest way a great</font>

983
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">example is I always go after das and I</font>

is the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> password as a DA account or</font>

just like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> variance off or they use</font>

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,220
administrator and then the Kerberos

990
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,939
tokens are out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that machine then you</font>

991
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,860
can just move from there to other

992
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,330
systems so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways around</font>

993
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,550
that but privileged access management is

994
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,230
another one the Vice guard is awesome

995
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,820
that's a new feature within Windows 10

996
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,680
if you're not familiar um it's kind of

997
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,780
like a blocker on steroids it's

998
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,130
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a trusted</font>

999
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,990
level of security in your environment if

1000
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,340
you have things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are non code signed</font>

1001
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,500
applications or things that you haven't

1002
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,480
seen before don't actually go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font>

1003
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,040
allow it another good method a

1004
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,559
suspicious process<font color="#CCCCCC"> of network</font>

1005
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,178
connections does reg SVR 32

1006
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:45,019
or run dll 32 ever need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to communicate</font>

1007
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:46,580
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet no why is it ever a</font>

1008
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:50,419
lot on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network in any way shape</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1009
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:52,428
form ever like if you see run dll 32 or

1010
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:53,990
register your r32<font color="#CCCCCC"> communicates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

1011
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,509
well there's actually some really really

1012
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,590
crummy printer drivers that every once

1013
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:58,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">and all were used one dlf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you</font>

1014
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,549
actually use like attacker methods that

1015
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:03,139
like China uses were like plug<font color="#E5E5E5"> X like I</font>

1016
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:04,249
think can and use the same thing or

1017
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:06,949
something like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

1018
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:10,610
friggin weird but then you have like

1019
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:13,100
registry<font color="#CCCCCC"> are 32 which is a bypass for</font>

1020
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:15,199
application whitelisting and reg SVR 32

1021
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,340
is actually proxy aware so you can

1022
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in download what are called</font>

1023
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,009
SCT files from the internet they don't

1024
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:21,019
have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that extension by the way</font>

1025
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:23,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">and directly execute code memory without</font>

1026
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:26,240
ever touching this so that's a bite

1027
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:27,499
defaulting on there's Casey Smith really

1028
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,570
step one<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually least one a blue</font>

1029
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:31,009
hat called tracker tracker is another

1030
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,539
one where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can basically import a dll</font>

1031
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,340
directly into memory your tracker

1032
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:35,929
there's event viewer you can use to get

1033
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,549
remote code execution these are things

1034
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:38,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be you know cognizant</font>

1035
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,779
of as you're actively going<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

1036
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,220
another good example is<font color="#E5E5E5"> powershell we're</font>

1037
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:44,809
starting to get good we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1038
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,600
at least move into the ability to detect

1039
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:49,039
powershell right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in some ways what's</font>

1040
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting is you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that most that</font>

1041
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,029
most people look for encoded command

1042
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:54,230
right but encoded command you know

1043
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,749
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 different variations of</font>

1044
00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:00,139
encoded command there's dash e there's

1045
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:01,820
dash ec there's ash en Jesse<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see you</font>

1046
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:03,168
know keep going there's 12 different

1047
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,240
variations that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need to look</font>

1048
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:06,830
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 encoded command or ie extra and</font>

1049
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,929
voc expression or other<font color="#CCCCCC"> methods that</font>

1050
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,129
typically hackers we used to go and

1051
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">download it and execute off the network</font>

1052
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:14,060
and I go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the nineteen ninety</font>

1053
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,440
five days with Marcus<font color="#CCCCCC"> raynham and</font>

1054
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,089
building the first firewall or whatever

1055
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,190
you said back then is like hey we should

1056
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:20,839
probably segment sales from marketing

1057
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and marketing from IT and IT from</font>

1058
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:24,139
everybody else and do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole network</font>

1059
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,579
segmentation thing no industry is like

1060
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:26,480
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's cool bets are like a lot of</font>

1061
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,399
work so we're just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

1062
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,810
everything open we're still paying for

1063
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,098
that stuff today everybody we go in twos

1064
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,359
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm syndrome hard on the</font>

1065
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:35,240
outside soft on the inside so you

1066
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise Bob in in sales now Obama</font>

1067
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,069
sales has access to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mary an IT</font>

1068
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,199
it has full communications and ports and

1069
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:44,569
protocols this does bobbin in sales

1070
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,598
every need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to you know Mary an</font>

1071
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:49,668
IT under with SMB or rdp or anything

1072
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,929
else ever never no it doesn't happen

1073
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:52,668
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a business process that we have</font>

1074
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,240
to be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use or do we need full</font>

1075
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:54,679
ports

1076
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,259
recalls on all servers and workstations

1077
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,390
no we don't so network segmentation

1078
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,970
works really well one my<font color="#CCCCCC"> super-awesome</font>

1079
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:04,368
favorite ones I'm our honey tokens this

1080
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,618
totally messes us up at his attackers by

1081
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,970
the way so there's a powershell script

1082
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:10,190
there's two powershell scripts you can

1083
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,709
go and grab one of them is what's called

1084
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,619
invoke run as it's from fuzzy security

1085
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,450
and you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a as what we</font>

1086
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:18,440
call honey token what happens is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1087
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,000
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would create a domain</font>

1088
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,200
admin on your domain controller and make

1089
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,190
it like a super complex character

1090
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">password like 100 character password</font>

1091
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,790
write it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down or print it and put it in</font>

1092
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,410
a safe and never use it again and then

1093
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,970
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do with invoke run as is</font>

1094
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,609
very similar to every promoted<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

1095
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,290
net only<font color="#E5E5E5"> command would not use what it</font>

1096
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,580
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually sprays credentials</font>

1097
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,990
into memory to be used at it'll at a

1098
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,880
later date so doesn't have to go on

1099
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,759
authenticate each time and so you can do

1100
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,070
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> invoke around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can say hey</font>

1101
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,660
create create a token on with this user

1102
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">name in this password and just store it</font>

1103
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,200
there but don't actually authenticate

1104
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,759
and so what will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you'll have a</font>

1105
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,080
domain admin that's legitimately there

1106
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,580
and your domain controllers and a fake

1107
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,230
pastor<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does not match the same one</font>

1108
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,520
as a domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> controller one you run that</font>

1109
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,470
as a scheduled task in your environment

1110
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,150
as a PowerShell commanding across<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1111
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">three networks if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever see a failed</font>

1112
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,440
login attempt with that that's really

1113
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad right you know someone is in your</font>

1114
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,200
environment right away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bo has</font>

1115
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,029
something I would go after as an

1116
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,980
attacker like I see a domain admin crib

1117
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> token or a domain admin username a</font>

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,220

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after that home am in token</font>

1120
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,430
right so you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> never see that</font>

1121
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen there's also another technique</font>

1122
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> llm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in r n b NS</font>

00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,629

1126
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,119

1128
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,780
way your group policy has it on an

round in my local subnet to see if it's

here to cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and bandwidth to my dns</font>

1140
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,390
servers don't say hey where's file

<font color="#E5E5E5">on file so everyone and it's like okay</font>

1143
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:58,640
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's my credentials and passes it</font>

1144
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,560
to you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like magic credentials in</font>

1145
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,299
your environment right and what's great

1146
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,980
about that technique is it passes net

1147
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,150
NCM be too but you know if you're using

1148
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,770
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> less than about a 12 or</font>

1149
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,980
anything less than a 12 character pass

1150
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,440
or

1151
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,910
it's pretty easy to break so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1152
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,130
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy for us as attackers to go</font>

1153
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,930
and do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find those in your</font>

1154
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,000
environment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can create on that's</font>

networks you can run them as scheduled

1160
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,050
tasks and it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a specific event</font>

1161
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:37,600
ID that you can look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for in your sims I</font>

1162
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:39,740
think it's 46 24 hour 46 48 sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> 46-48</font>

1163
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">46-48 what it says is explicit</font>

1164
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,850

1165
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,290
remote system so if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a fake</font>

1166
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,880
username and a fake pass where they know

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domain should that</font>

1168
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,430
using a password ever be used in your

<font color="#E5E5E5">environment all know so it we respond</font>

1170
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">are saying or invade or whatever they're</font>

1171
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,690
using for the tool is saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm</font>

1172
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,279
accepting anything just come connecting

1173
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,660
me yep I'm that person so you can

1174
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,590
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that event log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea you can</font>

1175
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually detect those in your</font>

1176
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,920
environment as it actually happened just

1177
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,710
by that specific event log ID which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1178
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,890
really neat so to really cool techniques

1179
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,300
that mess me up as an attacker on

1180
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,118
technology front if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

1181
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,220
technology um this is an interesting one

1182
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,810
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can augment users with</font>

1183
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,069
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably why</font>

1184
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:22,009
we're all here today is talking about

1185
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know how do we continue to produce</font>

1186
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,680
secure code with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

1187
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we see out there and if you look at</font>

1188
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,970
how fast technologies running I mean in

1189
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:30,410
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fast we need</font>

1190
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,899
to produce we came out with agile and

1191
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:35,029
DevOps you know full extension of of the

1192
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,380
development lifecycle Singh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay from</font>

1193
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,730
the developers all way to the

1194
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,590
architecture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that push</font>

1195
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,510
everything out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prod that's one arm of</font>

1196
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,950
our business that can allow code to be

1197
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">produced in a very efficient and</font>

1198
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,770
effective manner and that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

1199
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,869
way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's fantastic I think</font>

1200
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,920
security should be part of that not be

1201
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:50,869
the roadblock in any way like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

1202
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,850
wait wait we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> three months of</font>

1203
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:54,290
testing in you know QA and we're going

1204
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to need to send you some showstoppers</font>

1205
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,779
that go back to your environment and

1206
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,490
then six months later you can get this

1207
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,740
minor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reb that's an icon change into</font>

1208
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,479
production<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it can't work that way</font>

1209
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,459
anymore we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahold</font>

1210
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that and work with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organization's</font>

1211
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,150
to do agile and so that comes a lot of

1212
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">things there's a really great talk on</font>

1213
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,340
agile automation and security out there

1214
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I recommend is from Jimmy bird from</font>

1215
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,700
Derby can just look up Jimmy byr d and

1216
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,890
Derby Khan has a lot of good automation

1217
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,689
testing but we create these things you

1218
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,940
know we created<font color="#E5E5E5"> automation testing</font>

1219
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,859
bug bounty programs this<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped us out a</font>

1220
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,089
lot with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now it's interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bug</font>

1221
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:27,710
bounty programs especially the larger

1222
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:29,450
ones like Apple and everything else is

1223
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,550
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> never compete</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the black</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">market there's no way to effectively go</font>

1225
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,119
into it I mean a good example is an

1226
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:37,310
iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug right now is going for 1.5</font>

1228
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:44,660
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it go for for Apple I think it's a</font>

1230
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,750
I did oh no that's that was for

1231
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">something so there's different tiers for</font>

1232
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,160
that but yet you're right my career site

1233
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,480
did have it probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> should read those</font>

1234
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,629
ahead of time right thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

1235
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,190
for actually reading it's great um but

1236
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the local privilege</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">textbook that was used just recently</font>

1238
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,390
Microsoft does even pay a bounty fact

1239
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:07,640
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a specific method for getting</font>

around<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their prevention prevented</font>

1241
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,029

Chris Nickerson he had a good thing a

1243
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,000
bug bonnie is like going to bar walking

1244
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:15,230
in and leaving a button up on the table

1245
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,910
and saying first person who performs

1246
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:21,349
successful open heart surgery Tommy gets

1247
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:24,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">50 bucks and I like that because what's</font>

1248
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:25,670
what is to hit example I look Chris why

1249
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,930
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great example is you know while</font>

1250
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,280
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have somebody that may</font>

organ harvest lighter stuff and then

1260
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:42,589
sell it on the black market for much

of the hacks I mean most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you</font>

mean qualify for bug bounty programs in

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,270
the first place that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see out there so</font>

1278
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,099
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this and there's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1279
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,690
split in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this industry right now around</font>

1280
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:16,670
those that will sell to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the black market</font>

1281
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">or the private market whether it's</font>

government<font color="#CCCCCC"> government-sponsored</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff i</font>

1283
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:21,470
mean NSA is paying millions of bucks for

00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,849
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero-day so is Russia and</font>

1285
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,160
China everybody else so our private

1286
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:26,480
markets on that acting out there so

1287
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,430
there's a big split in industry right

1288
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,359
now round that and money and actually

1289
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,609
going and doing the right thing and

1290
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,509
security industry a lot of what we see

1291
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:35,969
today is due to

1292
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:38,249
you our own<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internally like a</font>

1293
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:41,130
good example is driving jeeps off the

1294
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:42,509
road right or what we call stunt hacking

1295
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,779
going off and doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cause</font>

1296

major media blitzes and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way every</font>

1297
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:49,469

<font color="#E5E5E5">screaming yelling and throwing tangents</font>

1299
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:53,459
in the security industry and what's

1300
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:55,079
interesting is every time lawmakers look

1301
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:55,948
at us they're like hey we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

and they're literally can just kill the

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,049
whole security market it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> get your</font>

1310
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:11,549
actually have to be adults when we do

00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:13,079
responsible disclosure and stuff like

1312
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:15,029
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no longer like hey we're going</font>

people now at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a zero date impacts</font>

1315
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:19,288
like everybody in the industry because

1316
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:22,199
we now have technology across everything

1317
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:23,609
so the security researchers are where a

1318
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,380
lot of this is at today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font>

1319
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:26,519
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future of what we're dealing</font>

1320
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,439
with in this industry the security

1321
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:29,519
research is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the forefront of what</font>

1322
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:31,319
we actively do and those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1323
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">that aren't necessarily solely relying</font>

1324
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:35,038
off of money but the folks actually

1329
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:42,419
make in the private<font color="#CCCCCC"> market so security</font>

1330
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:44,549
researchers are a lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> today a</font>

1331
00:42:42,419 --> 00:42:46,799
good example is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matthew graver he's one</font>

is so it's like a great relationship

<font color="#E5E5E5">countless researchers that are out there</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">or you know are going and active it</font>

1374
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,030
going and doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes an</font>

1375
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,169
impact some way that's what we can do to

1376
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,910
change this industry and that's us

1377
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,170
growing up that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has something</font>

1378
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,790
to do with like being commercial or

1379
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:07,890
anything else that just means growing up

1380
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:08,819
instead of Noah flying plane sideways

1381
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,020
and everything else that ends up

1382
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:12,599
happening on the news you typically see

1383
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,730
so last but it's it's you that makes the

1384
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,290
difference I like this quote do

1385
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:18,780
something today that your future self

1386
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,369
will thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for tomorrow right and I</font>

1387
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,869
love that quote because if you look at

1388
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:23,609
what we're here to do its to hopefully

1389
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:25,020
change something and make something

1390
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:27,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">better whether it's in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company or</font>

1391
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,009
company that we start ourselves or just

1392
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,140
sharing our resources that we can

1393
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:33,180
leverage to learn off of one another

1394
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,109
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up seeing as being one</font>

1395
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,629
of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important things in the</font>

1396
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:38,279
industry and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it I mean</font>

1397
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on making industry better</font>

1398
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,329
the industry will become a better place

1399
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:43,500
there's no question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and so</font>

1400
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:45,150
what's great about this industry and

1401
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,520
what I love seeing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we've grown</font>
