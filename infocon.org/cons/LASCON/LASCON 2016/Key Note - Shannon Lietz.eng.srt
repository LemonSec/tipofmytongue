2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,640
so a little bit about me to submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I</font>

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,130
am one of those people who basically is

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,308
a traditionalist right who basically has

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,690
become a recovering traditionalist and

6
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,150
over my years I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out as a</font>

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,290
developer I've gotten to understand

8
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:43,930
security operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> dev suck-ups I was</font>

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it and I was trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to</font>

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,720
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it but it really didn't</font>

11
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:48,370
have a name and I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even understand</font>

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,019
how to talk to people because I only

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,790
really sorry to understand what it meant

14
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:53,890
to be human like two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,930
um so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to bear with</font>

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,000
me a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit i might get kiki and</font>

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,269
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of speak some weird language so you</font>

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,420
might have to stop me um rugged you know

19
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:08,500
and in 2011<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a company that</font>

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,689
rhymes with pony hey station um so you

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,960
can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that rugged became something</font>

22
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:16,179
super exciting for me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:21,189
because somewhere in the neighborhood of

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:24,610
0 SE april 2011 rugged became the way

25
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:26,649
out it became the way forward and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,330
worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an organization where devops</font>

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,659
was being practiced but it was kind of

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:34,750
the called agile and scrum but it was

29
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:36,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">really devops and so um i would think</font>

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,010
that what was interesting was security

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">deed tractus was really difficult the</font>

32
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,210
conversations were hard we were doing

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,720
things like application security there's

34
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,820
tons of facts to know about april 2011

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,950
and what I'll tell you is we weren't all

36
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,449
that bad at security in fact there were

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,510
three weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from going to a new</font>

38
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,120
data center with security and what I'll

39
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:03,340
tell you is people make mistakes it only

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:06,130
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> one mistake for us to get owned it</font>

41
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,700
takes literally one mistake we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

42
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:12,700
be a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent right attackers</font>

43
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,379
only have to be right once and that

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,250
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the odds are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stacked against</font>

45
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:21,280
us so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about me set</font>

46
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,709
the stage software leading the world how

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,720
many know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this already you're all</font>

48
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,970
application security folks we've seen it

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,280
right our professions getting bigger and

50
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,170
more engaging and there's a lot more

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,819
software out

52
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,530
open source is becoming a big deal you

53
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,579
can go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on github and probably find</font>

54
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,170
most of the libraries that your

55
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,900
companies are leveraging every day I

56
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,549
know by the way how many people

57
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:49,450
contribute to those open source

58
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:54,010
libraries security bug fixes Wow one I

59
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,750
saw one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sad and it's</font>

60
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">really something that we need to change</font>

61
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,370
and so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you that as a</font>

62
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:02,590
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional we used to hold</font>

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,040
our cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> really close we don't like to</font>

64
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">share and as a recovering traditionalist</font>

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,760
software is eating the world this is a

66
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:13,030
passion of mine because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have two</font>

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">children and one of them is 18 months</font>

68
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">old and has already had her PII stolen</font>

69
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,548
that will change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real quick</font>

70
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,069
about how many bugs you fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> and open</font>

71
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:27,640
source it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> change your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world so</font>

72
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:30,488
drastically that everything you do will

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,458
be live breathe and eat putting security

74
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,810
into software so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can already see</font>

75
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,430
I've had some PTSD from security issues

76
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,920
and along the way what I've learned is

77
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,109
DevOps is on the rise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,030
passionate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because where I've</font>

79
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:48,069
started to see security<font color="#E5E5E5"> really take hold</font>

80
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,010
in the software community is through

81
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:53,619
devops in the last year alone there's

82
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,888
been a fifteen hundred percent increase

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,290
in the number of DevOps jobs isn't that

84
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy oh and by the way every single</font>

85
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">person in this room is being hunted</font>

86
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:06,700
because of DevOps you'll have many more

87
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,319
opportunities because of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's</font>

88
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,328
even more incredible because this this

89
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually looks like the curve that AWS</font>

90
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:15,160
talks about in their keynote have you

91
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:17,168
seen it like cloud and filling up and

92
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,180
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our data is moving into these</font>

93
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:22,029
environments and we've got to do things

94
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,479
a lot different my organization went all

95
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:27,010
in on the cloud and so did many more

96
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,469
organizations that I worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and what</font>

97
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,930
I've learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that to work with many</font>

98
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,789
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about where</font>

99
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,800
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all moving what the problems are</font>

100
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,240
of the future because what we do today

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,729
isn't going to get us where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

102
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">go tomorrow and so ultimately that means</font>

103
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,990
we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

104
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really big on changing I've</font>

105
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,199
evolved over

106
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,280
time because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheer necessity you</font>

107
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,490
would say that I'm one of those people

108
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,128
who have evolved in my career in my

109
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,750
skill set in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mindset</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in all the</font>

110
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:59,860
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i do just simply because</font>

111
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:03,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was no other option remember when</font>

112
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:06,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">i started back in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day there weren't</font>

113
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:11,109
a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like me I was super</font>

114
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:13,419
young I was female and oh by the way in

115
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,199
my computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> science class the first one</font>

116
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:18,969
I ever took I was one of 100 and so

117
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult thing to do</font>

118
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,840
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start thinking about this</font>

119
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another opportunity for us</font>

120
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,698
to change the way that we diversify how

121
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,159
we bring security to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front lines</font>

122
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,360
right there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough of us but</font>

123
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's because it's not really been an</font>

124
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,159
open society security needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve to</font>

125
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,110
the point where we're changing the world

126
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:42,729
I also remember when Josh Carmen said

127
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,379
this and shout out to him because he's

128
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,000
pretty amazing and if you haven't had a

129
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,889
chance to see anything on him which I

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,780
doubt anybody in this room hasn't seen a

131
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:53,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">Josh department talk but if you have it</font>

132
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to he said this and I remember</font>

133
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:58,330
when he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so viscerally because I</font>

134
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:01,300
actually realized that I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

135
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,060
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change careers and I was like do</font>

136
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,460
I go back to dev do i go back to ops do

137
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:11,080
I like become a biologist or something

138
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,359
get all the way out I'm actually I I

139
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,340
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> school for biology so that's</font>

140
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,900
kind of an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also went to law</font>

141
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,130
school because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something else you</font>

142
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,620
do when you're trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you are and you're evolving right I</font>

144
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,940
learned that that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really not a</font>

145
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">career option for me so this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

146
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,819
of security as we know it holy crap what

147
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all gonna do and then I realized</font>

148
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:34,300
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of took a few moments to</font>

149
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,539
realize what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say and</font>

150
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">later on I went to another talk and when</font>

151
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,169
he said the second time and this is when

152
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,310
I really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him was this is</font>

153
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:48,130
the end of security as we know it and

154
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't it a good thing what we could</font>

155
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the world if we got security to</font>

156
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,370
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's responsibility and it's</font>

157
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,800
our job to figure out how to make that

158
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,800
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sign me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

159
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:04,510
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kerry's new to the proctologist how</font>

160
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,000
many here wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a proctologist</font>

161
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,930
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you ended up here whether</font>

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,600
you wanted to or not I love

163
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,700
understanding other people now I didn't

164
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,920
have enough appreciation growing up for

165
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,740
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people to agree and what</font>

166
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,840
knowledge I could gain from them and

167
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,380
that rainbow<font color="#CCCCCC"> pictures the top is really</font>

168
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:29,020
offensive to me and I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate this</font>

169
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:32,020
because it means that we're losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

170
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,280
is how people view left we're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

171
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,960
and we're not at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end in a good way I</font>

172
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,549
don't want to look through poop every

173
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,020
day and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that's what it kind</font>

174
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,050
of looks like when you do a job like

175
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,900
ours I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go talk to people about</font>

176
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,030
what they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about stuff that</font>

177
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,280
they're building and helping them to

178
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:55,960
make decisions now how people get

179
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,900
invited to their development team to be

180
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:03,250
part of the crew and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions</font>

181
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,989
about their business that's a good

182
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">number you know why cuz last year I</font>

183
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,120
asked this question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was literally</font>

184
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,159
zero and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're changing</font>

185
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolving as a society of security</font>

186
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,780
professionals I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping this goes away</font>

187
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:23,340
and I think you guys can help me so when

188
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,989
I realized that I was a proctologist I

189
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,539
ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up realizing that it had to change</font>

190
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,570
and I started asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> people so this</font>

191
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:35,950
rugged<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps thing what is it exactly</font>

192
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,539
and I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a definition and then</font>

193
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,330
I got asked what's my definition of it

194
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,409
and ultimately along the way all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

195
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,240
folks that I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with</font>

196
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurities have always been trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

197
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,380
do good in this world I came from

198
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,000
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a variety of people but one</font>

199
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,040
of the most transformational times that

200
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,560
I've had was at Exodus where I worked

201
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">for Bill Hancock and Bill Hancock I</font>

202
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,060
actually got up after a speech like this

203
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,390
ran after him and said I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

204
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,810
for you and he looks over and goes who

205
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:08,319
the hell are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I'm like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> huh there we</font>

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">go it's an introduction and ever since</font>

207
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,220
then I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> banging my head against</font>

208
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,410
the wall and I have

209
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,779
placard in my office that<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks exactly</font>

210
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,639
like the bag in your head here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

211
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,990
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cat pictures you're</font>

212
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,300
going to see some cat pictures because I

213
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,420
had to bring them in um where's James

214
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:29,279

215
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:31,110
laugh right we've decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can</font>

216
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,519
either be funny or I can be

217
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,050
informational and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and</font>

218
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,839
do both today and teach you something

219
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,550
and I'm hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lessons you</font>

220
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,750
learn today you're going to spread and

221
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:47,459
make viral and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and it's your</font>

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:50,160
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so what's the definition of dev</font>

223
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,388
psych ops so remember I said that rugged

224
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,509
I asked everybody what the definition

225
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:56,610
was and I've asked everybody with the

226
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:59,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">definition of DevOps is to and what I've</font>

227
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,920
gotten out of rugged is it's basically a

228
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,069
variety of things but it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting</font>

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,399
security into software and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

230
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:10,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of DevOps was its collaboration what</font>

231
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:17,069
you'll get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deb spec ops is it's</font>

232
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:20,009
safer software sooner devops rugged dev

233
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:21,899
suck-ups and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care</font>

234
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:25,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you call it if you do something</font>

235
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:30,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that puts security into software awesome</font>

236
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:34,620
and if you have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yet and you need</font>

237
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:38,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to there's a TED talk on basically the</font>

238
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,139
future of learning by<font color="#CCCCCC"> sagada</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mitra he's</font>

239
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,290
incredible and what he tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> you is that</font>

240
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:46,920
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically building the wrong kind</font>

241
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,709
of people in our schools so every person

242
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,620
coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of school is coming out with</font>

243
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:55,018
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very structured understanding of</font>

244
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,029
what it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn they don't come</font>

245
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,759
out necessarily being collaborators we

246
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,949
give them math English science in other

247
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,079
countries other<font color="#E5E5E5"> languages but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

248
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:06,120
our learning structure has been centered

249
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,609
around building people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

250
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,029
replaceable so that you can ultimately

251
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,769
have a surplus of resources and then we

252
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:15,930
all get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out into the working world a lot</font>

253
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,420
of us in the computer technology field

254
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,910
and find out that all those skills

255
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,349
they're kind of interesting but there's

256
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,339
this new collaborative thing that's

257
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,990
happening

258
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,520
and so their schools are starting to

259
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,590
evolve and change but<font color="#CCCCCC"> sugata mitra</font>

260
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really makes a lot of great points and</font>

261
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,150
what he's basically said is that if you

262
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,820
drop the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle of a of</font>

263
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,110
some sort of third world country and you

264
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,450
plugged it in and all you provided was

265
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,420
power and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the</font>

266
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">hole-in-the-wall computer i think but</font>

267
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,810
you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to watch this talk and</font>

268
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why is because what he found</font>

269
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,800
out is that you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop that computer</font>

270
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,200
in the middle of these camps that

271
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,560
children would teach each other how to

272
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,110
use these computers literally with no

273
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,880
instructions whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not they knew</font>

274
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,380
how to speak English they would teach

275
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,420
themselves English to be able to

276
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:09,390
leverage computers holy crap and oh by

277
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,890
the way if they can teach themselves all

278
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,500
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we've been learning</font>

279
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,819
about our about<font color="#E5E5E5"> us solving bigger</font>

280
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:20,160
problems for the world and oh by the way

281
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,830
control is dead so figuring out how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

282
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,160
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with folks that are committed to</font>

283
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:27,630
financial reporting is essential and oh

284
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,730
by the way a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these articles don't</font>

285
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,130
really talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but it's one of</font>

286
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the biggest issues that we face as folks</font>

287
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,950
that are doing security and so I'll talk

288
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit about that later so by the</font>

289
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,620
way because we just have to have the

290
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">obligatory cat pictures unicorn suck</font>

291
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,270
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're really hard to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

292
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,189
how many people really need to know

293
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:54,240
what's in software to be able to do your

294
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,910
security job assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really important</font>

295
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,920
libraries dependencies if you're

296
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,930
figuring out how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do security the</font>

297
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,449
right way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know what's gonna</font>

298
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,310
stuff so by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way unicorn stuck</font>

299
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,820
because they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you it's</font>

300
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,260
all magic right dev<font color="#E5E5E5"> off well magic we're</font>

301
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,030
going to all learn together and we

302
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,090
probably won't document too much because

303
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:17,130
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sucks and yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright fine</font>

304
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,840
but you gotta be<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

305
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,670
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways in which we're</font>

306
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,450
working we got to figure out ways to

307
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:26,579
make it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sustainable and as a</font>

308
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,780
sustainable thing that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

309
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,590
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to document our</font>

310
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,199
code that's right

311
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,120
commenting I hate reading code where

312
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,990
there's no comments please God comment

313
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,480
your code and if you can do anything for

314
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,540
security getting added to<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps work on</font>

315
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,370
commenting it's a big improvement and

316
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,199
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why because somebody</font>

317
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,300
puts their decisions into the code that

318
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at and that means that</font>

319
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,839
sustainability<font color="#CCCCCC"> over time is us as</font>

320
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,520
security professionals putting our

321
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,680
security rationale in the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

322
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,480
we're actually looking at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

323
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">people actually go find a defect and</font>

324
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,280
then put in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment in the actual code</font>

325
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,079
to say that's the vulnerability I found

326
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,060
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed it and here's why you don't</font>

327
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:11,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to change this particular method</font>

328
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:18,569
call anybody do that yeah you might want

329
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,949
to us versus them so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

330
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,110
leadership books out there that talk

331
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">about us versus them and usually they</font>

332
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,550
talk about it as something that's kind

333
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,070
of derogatory and they talk about it

334
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:32,849
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint of people being in</font>

335
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:36,270
teams in companies being competitive so

336
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,010
that they can survive because companies

337
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,290
ultimately need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to outcomes in</font>

338
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,360
bottom line and that means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

339
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">driving a culture of us versus them but</font>

340
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,280
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that us versus them that we need</font>

341
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is attackers so the US is</font>

342
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,650
security plus DevOps plus everybody else

343
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,870
in your company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and oh by the way being</font>

344
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,000
the security professional that's really

345
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,480
the police and enforcer isn't all that

346
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
attractive because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're us is</font>

347
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,290
something that most people don't want so

348
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,660
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make your</font>

349
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">company more secure and be part of the</font>

350
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,310
US of making it secure whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

351
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,540
the business idea is stupid because we

352
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,369
all by the way I don't know anybody

353
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,490
who's a security professional who hasn't

354
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,600
got stupid in their blood like and I

355
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean like they think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

356
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,910
stupid they think everybody else is

357
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,680
stupid um i would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm actually</font>

358
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,780
recovering from that it's a long hard

359
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,430
journey and ultimately we're all going

360
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:34,199
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

361
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:39,310
so attackers again going back they only

362
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:41,470
have to get it once right that's it once

363
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,239
and you're broken into and oh by the way

364
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,360
lateral movement all those things right

365
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,670
kill chain now how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people have</font>

366
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,560
flawless perfect code that they either

367
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:58,000
look at every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that they built no</font>

368
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:01,089
no not neither um because coating is

369
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,800
hard so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all make mistakes and by the</font>

370
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:05,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">way an attacker only have to get it</font>

371
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">right once so how do you drive down</font>

372
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,990
having a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> and making it better so</font>

373
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ultimately attackers have less to</font>

374
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:15,010
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> after now it sounds kind of doomsday</font>

375
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,050
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell you that there's plenty</font>

376
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">of opportunities to make it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

377
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,640
attackers have a hard time finding all

378
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,620
of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

379
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:31,330
be perfect that or a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> less than you</font>

380
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:34,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think so I like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the US</font>

381
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:37,029
versus them is all about you know how we

382
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,069
identify with each other having fur as a

383
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,230
cat is kind of a big deal but if you're

384
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,850
a unicorn you need a horn so now we've

385
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,530
actually driven towards security

386
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,890
professionals having to have foreign

387
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,689
unicorn quite tendencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

388
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:53,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's important for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize it's</font>

389
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:55,240
probably part of being diverse for us to

390
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,270
be part of the club so not everybody has

391
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,360
to look like each other cultivation

392
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:03,220
takes leadership so how many people

393
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can get their company to</font>

394
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:10,030
invest in having security professionals

395
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:15,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps or more importantly help</font>

396
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:17,920
to secure DevOps I'm one I got a few

397
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,670
more down here that's awesome by the way

398
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,140
seeing a huge trend towards this

399
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,510
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are realizing that the skills</font>

400
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,490
are out there but not enough of each one

401
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,350
of them so as a security professional

402
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,800
we've all been driven<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards</font>

403
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,030
specialization application security is a

404
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,860
specialty by the way there are

405
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,000
specialties within specialties because

406
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,919
we've gotten to the point where it's

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to find the obscure thing</font>

408
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:46,179
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately DevOps needs a bunch of</font>

409
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,770
security generalists and you should know

410
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,540
how to do continuous delivery and you

411
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,540
should know how to publish software and

412
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:55,379
oh by the way you probably

413
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,420
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to have your skills so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

414
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,790
can tell you that when I hire folks into

415
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,230
my organization because it has invested

416
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:07,000
in trying to cultivate talent like this

417
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,250
the first thing I look for is do you

418
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">know dev do you know sec do you know ops</font>

419
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:16,450
and that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way in which we</font>

420
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,740
look at our talent pipeline when we deal

421
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,630
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of different</font>

422
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,000
interviews right can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

423
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,370
interviewing people and trying to apply

424
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,580
well let me see do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hire you for</font>

425
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:31,209
security you're a developer what do you

<font color="#E5E5E5">know about security or your security</font>

427
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,740
professional but you can't write a look

428
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,470
at code<font color="#CCCCCC"> how's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen we've</font>

429
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,630
hired all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one question</font>

430
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,750
that you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand to</font>

431
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:47,770
hire your security talent and this is an

432
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:50,500
area that's really hard what are they

433
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,450
passionate about and if they're

434
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,530
passionate<font color="#E5E5E5"> about safer software sooner</font>

435
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,660
guess what they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get up every</font>

436
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">day and they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on their</font>

437
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,000
development skills and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

438
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,990
work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their security skills and</font>

439
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,840
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna work on their operation</font>

440
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:05,440
skills and sometimes they're going to

441
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,020
work on it not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> at work people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

442
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,290
home every day at my organization and

443
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,450
they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their skills I call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

444
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,580
private hidden projects you'll know them

445
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,650
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and github and</font>

446
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,659
people are contributing and it's a

447
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,790
really different way of operating but

448
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,790
they're all always<font color="#E5E5E5"> building skills and</font>

449
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:27,399
that means basically that if you do

450
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,639
nothing else to get security into<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps</font>

451
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,810
to get safer software sooner if

452
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,450
everybody's trying to build skills and

453
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,830
cultivation is not necessarily an option

454
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only a couple of hands</font>

455
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:42,399
here then competence is an important

456
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">aspect and I put the heart here because</font>

457
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,520
people are passionate about building

458
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:52,980
skills I want to learn from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolute</font>

459
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,510
best people i can put myself in front of

460
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,300
that means i better have very cool

461
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,970
friends and oh by the way they better

462
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,360
know a lot of stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a really</font>

463
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,360
high bar

464
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,580
I'm kind of short so maybe my car's not

465
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,590
that high you know wicked you should

466
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,949
have my<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

467
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:16,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">little higher um if I stand next to him</font>

468
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:19,010
it's really really hums sad for me so

469
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,220
competency you gotta<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect people</font>

470
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,908
remember that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I said earlier about</font>

471
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:29,419
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> if everybody else is stupid how</font>

472
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:31,309
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to learn from them and by</font>

473
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:35,419
the way everybody has something for you

474
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:38,299
to learn from them everybody and what

475
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:42,590
I've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I used to have this in</font>

476
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:47,000
my makeup<font color="#E5E5E5"> because security folks don't</font>

477
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:49,010
trust other people something happened to

478
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,429
us along the way where we just don't

479
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:55,720
trust and I think to myself like this is

480
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:58,909
a behavioral ingrained like fully

481
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,710
intense behavior that I have to unlearn

482
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:06,020
every day now that person's got a point

483
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:08,419
yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I gotta reconsider this and oh</font>

484
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,400
by the way that used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take me a long</font>

485
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:12,580
time and it's gotten better over time

486
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,020
because I've really worked on it every

487
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,439
person you come in contact with your

488
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,690
janitor your trash truck truck driver it

489
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,549
doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> because everybody has</font>

490
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that they're super good at and</font>

491
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,770
if you change your mind that you can

492
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,140
respect people for what they have to

493
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell you every day then ultimately</font>

494
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,070
you're going to go from I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at one</font>

495
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,220
point it took me years to really value

496
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,168
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now it probably takes me</font>

497
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,580
only a few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

498
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:44,120
person I'm sitting in front of has

499
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:48,320
something truly worth listening to that

500
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,520
listening thing super important I've

501
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,799
gotten in the room with many people

502
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">where I've determined like this person</font>

503
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:56,720
thinks that I'm stupid only because they

504
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,440
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk until the end of the</font>

505
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,750
meeting I hate meetings I have a no

506
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,020
meeting culture so you're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

507
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:08,630
meeting and you're like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I</font>

508
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,970
can't teach this person anything the

509
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">agenda says that I am not that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valued</font>

510
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:16,429
and somehow i'm going to have to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

511
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,370
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm always the person who</font>

512
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:19,080
now sits in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and me</font>

513
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,459
where somebody else is talking it's a

514
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,220
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> long meeting it's about an hour</font>

515
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,010
long the person talks for 59 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

516
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,540
then they said at the very edge have any

517
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,379
questions and I'm like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> how can I</font>

518
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:34,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">help you it's the only question you</font>

519
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,080
really need to ask how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can I help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

520
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:39,330
it's a conversation starter by the way

521
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,040
at 59<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes that person all of a</font>

522
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:49,110
sudden goes oh yeah we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

523
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,639
another meeting I have a no meeting

524
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,199
culture on purpose we<font color="#E5E5E5"> knocked down all</font>

525
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,260
the walls we knocked down a bunch of

526
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,150
offices in my location um some folks

527
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,210
like it some foam folks hate it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

528
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:02,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety percent of my crew to</font>

529
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:05,250
like sitting around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a table listening to</font>

530
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,320
other people and learning a learning

531
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,940
culture is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to foster</font>

532
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,939
because it means that people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

533
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,370
listen as much as they talk getting your

534
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,679
brain trained around that so that you

535
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,320
don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hear yourself talk is</font>

536
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,429
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most critical</font>

537
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,330
things we have to do so competency if

538
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:26,460
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn a bunch of things</font>

539
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:29,370
together today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way I'm going</font>

540
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sneak in some vegetables here so some</font>

541
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,919
of my slides are going to be needy

542
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,230
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of words I</font>

543
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,200
will definitely give you a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

544
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,670
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me later on so that you don't</font>

545
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,220
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take notes some of the slides</font>

546
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,870
are actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty dense</font>

547
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,840
this one's pretty easy if there's

548
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:49,020
nothing else that you do zone your

549
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:53,159
software up and if there's nothing else

550
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:55,350
you do instrument it if you actually

551
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,630
could see attackers taking advantage of

552
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,629
your software sooner couldn't you do

553
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:03,600
something about it by the way that see

554
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:06,900
right there these are grades we do stuff

555
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,340
with a b c d e f and on very

556
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,140
intentionally not because we think

557
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,389
people are stupid but because it's

558
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,140
ultimately a universal<font color="#CCCCCC"> language to talk</font>

559
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how somebody's competency is</font>

560
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:21,150
utilizing grave universities don't get

561
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,880
it wrong they have figured out how to

562
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:27,300
train us to do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and measure that</font>

563
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,400
so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to talk</font>

564
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,649
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> people about CB SS</font>

565
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,340
and the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts out with hey</font>

566
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:38,610
you have a 7.2 vulnerability and oh hey

567
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,560
by the way that's bad and the person

568
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,659
saying well I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if I agree i</font>

569
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,889
think i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 3.4 because you sent me</font>

570
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,760
the calculator and i don't agree with

571
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,290
your assessment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i always get taken</font>

572
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
back for that because i say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

573
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:55,290
great because the 7.2 was actually

574
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,669
exploited by my red team so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

575
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">still a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seven point it doesn't really</font>

576
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,900
matter now if I told you this was an F

577
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,910
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fix it and by the way</font>

578
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,310
unanimously every person i've ever asked

579
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,480
that question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like yeah i would</font>

580
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:11,520
look really dumb in front of my

581
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,450
leadership if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't fix an ass oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

582
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">great CBS's now I have a mapping for CBS</font>

583
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:21,120
s we have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of ways to figure</font>

584
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,210
out how to step step into these grades

585
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,219
and a methodology that's produced really

586
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:30,330
interesting prioritization principles so

587
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:33,150
it's really pretty great build attack

588
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:36,470
naps I didn't say threat models I know

589
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,470
I'm standing in front of last time

590
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:44,250
threat models are awesome for us but

591
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever tried to get a developer</font>

592
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,750
to spend time threat modeling and

593
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:52,230
continue and maintain it how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

594
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been super successful at that oh my</font>

595
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,570
gosh like 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I had this</font>

596
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,040
experiment that Iran I went into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a room</font>

597
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,200
I didn't train anybody on threat

598
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,659
modeling I gave them a piece of paper I

599
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,250
put a few boxes on it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said tell me</font>

600
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,800
all the ways in which your software

601
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,510
could be attacked these are folks that

602
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,210
don't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> security they came back</font>

603
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,460
after 10 minutes 10 minutes and I didn't

604
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:18,390
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them off one by one I sent them off</font>

605
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,340
in packs like dead lobs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they came</font>

606
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and they had these super detail to</font>

607
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,929
tighten up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm like you know all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

608
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,930
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions you made</font>

609
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,600
and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I said what would you be</font>

610
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:39,389
willing to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with me and they</font>

611
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:42,149
said sure oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can touch your stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

612
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and then I went to my red team and</font>

613
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:48,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">I said hey dude what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

614
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:50,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and they're like huh not a</font>

615
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,280
whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said all right so here's</font>

616
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,680
here's a game for you could you go out

617
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,270
and like do some reconnaissance and tell

618
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,020
me what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find out about our software</font>

619
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:03,210
and they've come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and they basically</font>

620
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">built something that look like this and</font>

621
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gosh devops security</font>

622
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:14,580
common language attack that they take 10

623
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,040
to 15 minutes to do they don't have to

624
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">be perfect they can be iterated as you</font>

625
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,370
learn they're going to evolve they're

626
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,870
going to get better and oh by the way

627
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,780
they can get included in things like

628
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:27,330
readme files and I don't know an attack

629
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,970
but MV file and oh wait those are things

630
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:33,090
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put in a code repo pretty</font>

631
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:35,760
darn cool right artifacts are awesome so

632
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:39,600
my red team does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this every time they</font>

633
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,160
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> target and our developers have</font>

634
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,629
been looking at doing this some of them

635
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,980
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to produce threat</font>

636
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,120
modeling and then they've realized like

637
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,360
that takes a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and then</font>

638
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually they end up over here I did</font>

639
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,260
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for many many companies and I've</font>

640
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,770
gone back to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's stuck and it</font>

641
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,300
has stuff so I can tell you it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a</font>

642
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">while to evolve it because we keep</font>

643
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,480
sending out the message that folks thing

644
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,899
to do threat modeling and I can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

645
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an awesome exercise it doesn't</font>

646
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,020
necessarily keep up with the speed of

647
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:14,520
continuous delivery continuous delivery

648
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:17,639
security so if Fred Astaire is<font color="#E5E5E5"> dancing</font>

649
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,440
forward publishing software right he's

650
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,540
moving to the right and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way all</font>

651
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,010
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his tools are super sexy and they're</font>

652
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,110
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where we</font>

653
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,180
invest our money and time is into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

654
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,740
development pipeline so that we can get

655
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,010
to customer outcomes and generate

656
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,910
revenue security goes the opposite

657
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:39,580
direction so Ginger Rogers backwards and

658
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:41,200
in high heels yeah so security goes

659
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,600
the left we're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust and</font>

660
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,940
confidence into our pipeline and if

661
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,419
you're not doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it well you're probably</font>

662
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:52,960
way over here at the right and moving up

663
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:55,900
to the left side is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard and our</font>

664
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,360
tools there's so many of them by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

665
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,390
if you're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security tool I</font>

666
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:05,260
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need you to build a good rest api</font>

667
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have SAT up night after night working</font>

668
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,210
with security tools realizing they don't

669
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,970
do good rest bring a developer into your

670
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,490
crowds security professionals write

671
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,110
software like that and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

672
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,280
any questions of a developer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

673
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,770
actually know how to write a rest

674
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:24,399
interface so just they're kind of cool

675
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,780
people developers can help you um so if

676
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing that please do it better</font>

677
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,129
because I've wrestled with a lot of

678
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:32,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">these things like hey by the way if I'm</font>

679
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,030
going to request a scan you shouldn't

680
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,770
make it so difficult for me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

681
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,200
outcomes by putting in three different

682
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,389
calls and I have to know some number to

683
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,400
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out because that's going to be</font>

684
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,800
really hard and it requires complex

685
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,020
coding and some people have a hard time

686
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,300
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so this is kind of the</font>

687
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,740
cauliflower part of the conversation if

688
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,919
you've noticed the vegetable is at the

689
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,060
very top I'm kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sneaking them in</font>

690
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,430
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see why that's important later</font>

691
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:00,220
and it I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a clue that</font>

692
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:05,440
rainbow<font color="#E5E5E5"> could picture that pisses me off</font>

693
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:10,300
yeah comes in later continuous security

694
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,280
feedback who likes spaghetti yeah you

695
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,290
eat tomatoes right who doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

696
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:19,210
tomatoes you probably don't like

697
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:20,830
spaghetti right or that's how you're

698
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:23,740
getting cert your<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomatoes but</font>

699
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">ultimately the feedback loop is an</font>

700
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,730
important part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the process if you're</font>

701
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">devops the feedback loop is how you</font>

702
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,550
actually get information out of your

703
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,340
software so that you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it better</font>

704
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:35,050
the security part of that feedback loop

705
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> intel highway is how you actually</font>

706
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:40,480
get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> information into the feedback</font>

707

loop and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way security information</font>

708
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,400
is in the actual feedback loop but that

709
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,500
Intel is also super important and

710
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical how many attackers are hitting</font>

711
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,100
your software most developers struggle

712
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,680
with figuring that out because by the

713
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,719
way

714
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,490
that takes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to sift through</font>

715
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,550
that information and really discover

716
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,660
what it is we've gone through the effort

717
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,030
of figuring out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put our</font>

718
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,560
vulnerabilities and defects right next

719
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,320
to a number that shows how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

720
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,639
attackers are hitting our software

721
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,100
because of the very high levels of our

722
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,330
organization that can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

723
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:16,580
awesome thing because an SVP or an EVP

724
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,659
or CTO or any of those folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

725
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,800
looking at that information can

726
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:24,950
immediately go ha<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have 500 problems</font>

727
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:29,870
and I get hit with 250,000 attacks a day

728
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:31,730
oh I should invest in security so super

729
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,750
interesting very critical and oh by the

730
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,040
way if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

731
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:37,070
development team to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information</font>

732
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,780
together they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so</font>

733
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,450
that ultimately means that security

734
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,700
professionals have a responsibility of

735
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,770
figuring out how to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

736
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,470
digest the security information and

737
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:52,190
outcomes and measurement data to help a

738
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,410
developer test your code like everyone

739
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:58,280
else does by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way a total shout-out</font>

740
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,900
to Chris<font color="#E5E5E5"> gate and Chris Nickerson if you</font>

741
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,510
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a red team you should get a</font>

red team and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should watch that video</font>

743
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:07,280
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about an hour long super funny it's</font>

744
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:10,730
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Baruch on we do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of red teaming</font>

00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,790
i usually have red hair but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm kind of</font>

do for an appointment<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and so if i'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to sneak things in i'm going to</font>

748
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,310
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that you probably don't want to</font>

749
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,860
eat poisonous mushrooms you probably

750
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:23,960
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out before you eat those</font>

751
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,699
mushrooms that they're poisonous so you

752
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,570
get a red team to attack things and

753
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,920
figure those things out cat got to bring

754
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">you back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cats because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

cats are kind of fun I'm allergic<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

756
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,760
them ultimately though vegetables really

757
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,870
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cat doesn't like vegetables I'm just</font>

758
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,950
going to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a vegetable in</font>

759
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:42,979
front of a cat they're going to god I'll

760
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:48,830
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the finger and it's a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

761
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:51,200
fun thing to watch I love companies that

762
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:55,010
dedicate toward solving customer

763
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,520
problems I'm not excited about unseen

764
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:01,400
secure software that comes out that is

765
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:04,250
said to be secure and by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

766
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,580
not imagine that

767
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:10,220
that you found out that your software

768
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,949
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using your service isn't</font>

769
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,780
very secure and how do you collaborate

770
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,280
with the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the provider</font>

771
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,530
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to actually make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it better</font>

772
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,389
well you kind of have a scientific

773
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,950
approach you have to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

774
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to trust something you</font>

775
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,280
don't just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and listen to somebody and</font>

776
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,169
they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey I've got these like 150</font>

777
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,260
controls built in and oh by the way it's

778
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,850
great yeah by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way your software your</font>

779
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,520
service is actually on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

780
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet by default it loads up with a</font>

781
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,710
dashboard that has a default password

782
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:43,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets broken into in about eight</font>

783
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:46,190
hours there's hundreds of customers

784
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,790
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> this software well we should work</font>

785
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,890
on it so for four months later that

786
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:55,879
software was secure and I'm super

787
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:59,180
excited because we helped a cloud

788
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,800
provider make this software better by

789
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,650
simply asking the question like how did

790
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:08,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get to trust this and I like well we</font>

791
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:10,639
build perfect stuff oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I don't know</font>

792
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,279
about that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go measure it right</font>

793
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,200
so as security professionals our thing

794
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to measure and to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and</font>

795
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,100
to figure out how to make it better um

796
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:23,029
if you ever do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

797
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:25,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">corn go Google corn and poison you'll</font>

798
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:28,700
learn some things super interesting and

799
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:31,190
so what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you if you can't</font>

800
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:34,279
just trust that things are good go and

801
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:36,310
educate yourself do the experiments work

802
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,560
with other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who know these things</font>

803
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:42,679
reuse shout out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sonatype because they</font>

804
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,259
provide me<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cool data um you know</font>

805
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,870
you gotta understand how to look at your

806
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,389
software how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people look at the</font>

807
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:52,638
manifest in their software and

808
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:56,840
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> library's very carefully</font>

809
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,240
I look at stuff all the time if you're

810
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,300
not your organization is probably using

811
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,450
a library and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yuri utilizing it and</font>

812
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,790
reutilization is probably just

813
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,950
continuing to leverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because they</font>

814
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,390
don't know any better necessarily no

815
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,060
one's telling them and oh by the way

816
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,650
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

817
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,540
time to go test everything they do

818
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,160
sometimes get information in from

819
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,870
vulnerability scanners about what they

820
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,960
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix and then oh by the way</font>

821
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:23,790
refactoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> John Stevens from Seattle</font>

822
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,010
has this really cool information about

823
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,330
how to make software better and a lot of

824
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,160
the things he'll tell you is that you

825
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,810
end up refactoring your software to make

826
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,000
security fit in later in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pipeline</font>

827
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:40,230
about 75% of your code gets rewritten

828
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,790
whose organization has 75% extra to make

829
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:47,760
software more secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the fact ah</font>

830
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:49,350
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what's</font>

831
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,760
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if you're a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

832
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:55,830
professional data is a key<font color="#E5E5E5"> component</font>

833
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,030
having a lot of information sifting it

834
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,360
the right way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and getting too high</font>

835
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:02,880
fidelity makes you a king developers

836
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,580
will love you if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste their</font>

837
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,710
time you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where we're headed</font>

838
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,270
as a profession it's getting to better

839
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:12,540
measurement it's figuring out how to

840
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,890
have high fidelity prioritize defects so

841
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,050
that people don't waste their time on

842
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,859
stuff forecasting what's going to get

843
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:23,310
attacked who's good at forecasting well

844
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,510
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool skill um telling</font>

845
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,000
people what they should spend their time

846
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:29,880
on is kind of interesting it's hard and

847
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,320
I i go back to Wed Chris gates and Chris

848
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nickerson are talking about in their</font>

849
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,740
video and I what I'll tell you is

850
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,910
they're talking a lot about the same

851
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:42,120
thing and they leverage the miter attack

852
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:45,149
framework to do it kind of cool concept

853
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,609
I like the attack framework I don't kind

854
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,340
of use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yet in my environment because</font>

855
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:55,500
we leverage to fill chain trademark out

856
00:36:50,340 --> 00:37:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to I think it was who's got that one or</font>

857
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:03,660
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilt a lucky awesome thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

858
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:06,090
tongue-tied so like zucchini this is an

859
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,529
important part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the concept and we</font>

860
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,120
leveraged kill chain to do it high

861
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,030
fidelity comes out of understanding

862
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:16,080
whether something is exploitable whether

863
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:18,060
it can be exploited and the rest of it's

864
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,069
interesting but you should utilize your

865
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,499
red team to take all that information

866
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:25,380
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> something of it don't waste peoples</font>

867
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:27,509
time now I will also tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that most</font>

868
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,390
vulnerability scanners tend to find

869
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:31,410
feature gaps but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about him</font>

870
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,199
that way we talk about them as

871
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,868
vulnerabilities we've gone to defect and

872
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,789
feature if you built your software so

873
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:41,160
that my vulnerability scanner is finding

874
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,739
feature gaps I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually send</font>

875
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,629
you a feature gap in your backlog so

876
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:47,489
we've gotten trust with our developer

877
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,309
crowd by simply trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into their</font>

878
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:52,619
backlog what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we said hey you</font>

879
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:55,130
can come to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> system to go look up</font>

880
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:57,239
your defects and your feature requests

881
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:01,410
well we can put them directly into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

882
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:03,089
backlog and at first they were like well

883
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,499
we'll just come to yours and then they

884
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize well we can't prioritize</font>

885
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:12,868
properly just put<font color="#E5E5E5"> em in ours when we put</font>

886
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,609
defects straight into our backlogs that

887
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:16,769
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that developers own the</font>

888
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:20,788
responsibility of prioritizing the work

889
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:25,618
of security that's a big difference how

890
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:27,180
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do that awesome Oh twenty</font>

891
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:32,969
percent that's a big change from last

892
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:38,308
year speaking developer how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

893
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:40,769
code whoo this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a cool crowd I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

894
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:42,779
hang out more about fifty percent raise

895
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:45,709
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I bet it's actually more in</font>

896
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:49,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">this crowd everything is becoming code</font>

897
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:51,239
so I is really hard we've had security

898
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:52,890
professionals in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> group that have had</font>

899
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,690
to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to code one of my</font>

900
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,879
requirements to work on my team as you

901
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:02,339
must code and if you don't code you have

902
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,289
a year to figure it out and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

903
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:06,538
one person like took me up on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

904
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:08,910
said I am a super valuable security

905
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:11,789
professional that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm kind of</font>

906
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:14,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">big thing and I'm like that's great you</font>

907
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:17,519
don't code you're out in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year so he</font>

908
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:20,039
he's like nine ten months into it no

909
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">coding and I'm like so what you gonna do</font>

910
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:26,430
in a couple months and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's like your</font>

911
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:29,308
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kidding right I'm like no you're</font>

912
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:32,089
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to code and in the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

913
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:32,089
he learned how to code

914
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:37,850
he's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome the company that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

915
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:43,010
now works for really appreciates that he

916
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:44,960
goes but that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he didn't</font>

917
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:47,300
code it's because he's a pretty great

918
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,490
resource now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell you that he</font>

919
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,970
goes part of the challenge of becoming

920
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:55,640
really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at something so working on</font>

921
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:58,160
the ego thing big deal I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you I</font>

922
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,049
make mistakes all day long every day and

923
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,210
I'm the first to admit that I could be

924
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,880
made better just by simply having people

925
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:07,160
tell me that I can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better I love</font>

926
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,550
conflict I love working with people who

927
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,379
will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that I suck I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

928
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,940
look for those people I'm like you know

929
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,820
what you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> told me I suck we should</font>

930
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:22,070
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> best friends and I like that you suck</font>

931
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:23,510
my kiss I know make me better we should

932
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,550
be looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that make us</font>

933
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,230
better and oh by the way as security

934
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,780
professionals you can make developers

935
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:32,000
better you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily have to</font>

936
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,390
tell them they suck find a better way I

937
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,640
still do the you<font color="#E5E5E5"> suck and so I'm kind of</font>

938
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:40,790
known<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the queen of criticism and</font>

939
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,589
feedback and it's gotten me a long list

940
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,390
of people to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and at first</font>

941
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,810
people thought I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought they were</font>

942
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">stupid and what I'll tell you is you</font>

943
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,350
have to find a way to have people

944
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,910
understand that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly care you're</font>

945
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,920
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them feedback at our</font>

946
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,390
company feedback to feedback as a gift

947
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,290
when I first got there I was like

948
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:04,190
feedback to what Oh somebody's not tell

949
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:06,860
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and we foster that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> culture</font>

950
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,630
fabulous and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I realized what they</font>

951
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,310
meant if somebody truly cares they're

952
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:13,310
going to tell you that you could be

953
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:15,140
better and that means having conflict

954
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,720
and telling somebody that things could

955
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,040
go better means that you care and you

956
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,799
love them and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

957
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,660
competency with them so finding a way to

958
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,220
foster that is important sometimes you

959
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,290
can do it through<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply having</font>

960
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,430
developer speak going<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and telling</font>

961
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,890
somebody how they could build<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

962
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,629
code and helping them see the refined

963
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,549
way of doing something does have a

964
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:38,660
benefit so focusing on the work and have

965
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:41,660
a big effect on that translate security

966
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,750
into something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't sound</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

967
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:47,930
security

968
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:50,390
ABCDEF super useful make decisions and

969
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,950
put them on paper and share them so if

970
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,509
you know that you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

971
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,419
encryption and you need to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

972
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:59,210
these things actually doing this is part

973
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,250
of the process and so what I'll tell you

974
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,480
is giving somebody at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the means that</font>

975
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,860
they say you know what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got other</font>

976
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,390
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are more important right</font>

977
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,370
now when that great<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets lower I'm gonna</font>

978
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,129
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about it and watching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

979
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:12,080
great get lower allows them to take risk

980
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,690
in the right way so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

981
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,340
risk balancing this is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> method and</font>

982
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,680
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way trending and all the pools</font>

983
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,150
excitable you're gonna have to code to

984
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,040
really leverage the data that's going to

985
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,680
help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's useful</font>

986
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,509
and effective so anybody who didn't

987
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,220
raise their hand you really need to code

988
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,420
whoever<font color="#CCCCCC"> raised their hand should be</font>

989
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:34,250
helping the person who didn't raise

990
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:37,640
their hand bonus I actually didn't think

991
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">beets were all that good um candy cane</font>

992
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,379
beets turned out to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good and</font>

993
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:46,520
when I was unhealthy I actually had to

994
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:49,130
drink beet juice every day um and I

995
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,820
realized that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy it shocker</font>

996
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:55,040
um and over time I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got to like</font>

997
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">it but at first it was really disgusting</font>

998
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:01,460
and so I've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's actually</font>

999
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:05,150
made me healthy again it took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a year</font>

1000
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:07,820
to get back to where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am and i also</font>

1001
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:10,070
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I found a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to sneak</font>

1002
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,770
in a vegetable that was really important

1003
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:15,410
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was put eighty percent of security</font>

1004
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:18,770
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> into software by simply focusing on</font>

1005
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:21,920
five things five because that's what one

1006
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,270
hand will allow me to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by</font>

1007
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way most people can remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1008
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:29,660
58 things pretty well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight is where</font>

1009
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:31,879
you start to degrade but at five you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1010
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely have them remember enough to</font>

1011
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,450
make their software better if they look

1012
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,280
at these five things while their coding

1013
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:39,259
that by the way they might actually

1014
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,600
remember to do them understanding their

1015
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,000
zoning principles having good asset

1016
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,319
management libraries<font color="#E5E5E5"> manifest figuring</font>

1017
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,120
out how they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do logging and</font>

1018
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,380
instrumentation oh by the way one of the

1019
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,000
most important critical things is that

1020
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,720
you have this ability and clarity and

1021
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,200
then finally the authentication thing

1022
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">super critical I do kind of wedge in I</font>

1023
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,759
vacation and authorization in that

1024
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,530
little bar I didn't put them all in

1025
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,089
because by the way if you do

1026
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:07,420
authentication while you have to solve

1027
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:11,740
for identity and authorization I get

1028
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:13,630
both so encryption most developers focus

1029
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:18,790
on encryption because encryption is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1030
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:20,440
silver<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet right uh ya know so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1031
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,839
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kristen solves about three things</font>

1032
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,609
that's the cherry on top and when you

1033
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:26,619
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that that means that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

1034
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:29,290
need it it's really important but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

1035
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:31,000
for a select number of attacks so having

1036
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,250
people understand that the bottom of

1037
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,630
this pyramid is super important it's

1038
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually what keeps the pyramid alive</font>

1039
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,440
that's zoning and containment you're

1040
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,210
hearing about docker and all these

1041
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,829
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things those are awesome from</font>

1042
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,500
a security perspective if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know</font>

1043
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:47,859
those containment technologies you

1044
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:52,420
should that is the bread and butter of

1045
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:53,859
security in the future benefits of

1046
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,680
DevOps with security we've had about

1047
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:59,920
fifty percent that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result from doing</font>

1048
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,690
these things and that's from basic

1049
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,300
measurements across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pipeline that</font>

1050
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:06,220
ranges from 30 year old software to

1051
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:10,359
brand new<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that's built every day</font>

1052
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:12,040
and continuously delivered and I like to

1053
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:13,839
focus on this because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what</font>

1054
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,589
actually makes people really interested

1055
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:21,069
in trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things better so</font>

1056
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:25,060
damn desk tech ops I'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix that</font>

1057
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:26,920
later so I really didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

1058
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,509
picture if I could make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that</font>

1059
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,730
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> was out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

1060
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:33,520
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy that's the janitor make</font>

1061
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,260
your poop biodegradable and all of a

1062
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,609
sudden security is actually built in all

1063
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:41,770
the vegetables really do help if you are

1064
00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:43,140
if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a proctologist and talk to</font>

1065
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:50,170
them you know what they tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1066
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:52,839
eat your vegetables<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chuckie so we had a</font>

1067
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,640
vegetable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every single one I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

1068
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:56,290
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you utilize a recipe</font>

1069
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,118
you don't have to worry about the poop

1070
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:00,009
picture that everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else says that</font>

1071
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,680
security practitioners are proctologist

1072
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,329
because ultimately proctology as a field

1073
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,310
will go away if we just eat our

1074
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:12,200
vegetables awesome

1075
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mars Louie yeah new world right dev ops</font>

1076
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,990
can be such a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> field</font>

1077
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:20,300
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> embrace it we need to do it</font>

1078
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:22,310
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and we need to help it be more</font>

1079
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:26,920
secure so that software can be safer

1080
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:31,009
sooner if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do nothing join a group</font>

1081
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:35,900
contribute to the conversation think

1082
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:39,650
about it and I can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that if you</font>

1083
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:42,140
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing it won't get better find two</font>

1084
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:45,320
people to talk about this kind of thing

1085
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:47,000
with make them better they will make two

1086
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,310
people better and we will figure out how

1087
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,780
to do this at the society and make

1088
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:55,790
attackers go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you for my</font>

1089
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,610
children they're going to appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1090
00:46:55,790 --> 00:47:01,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hard work that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do to make this a</font>

1091
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:03,640
reality so thank you so much for your

1092
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,640
time today

1093

you
