00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is that seven people signed up so</font>

00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,490
there's more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's good first</font>

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,689
I'm tired how about the Cubs huh

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,920
[Applause]

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,020
I'm actually not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> baseball family was</font>

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
fun to watch so maybe it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my</font>

12
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:50,839
Ken Lee explained it very well I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,449
around a while I'm with envision a lots

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,160
of consulting I go buy golf hacker Dave

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,900
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hack in golf usually at the</font>

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,660
same time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still try so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,200
stuff we do blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah so what I'm</font>

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,000
here to do today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is talk about your apps</font>

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,800
your mobile apps and we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">look kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like this right big</font>

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,520
fortress you know being<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,020
guide probably recommend putting a moat

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,899
around it you know there's not one there

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,970
but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we want to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

25
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:24,380
instead of looking something like that

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:27,979
right no thank you but this is kind of

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,899
where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at so first person to tell</font>

28
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:35,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">me the answer here wins the prize what</font>

29
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:40,430
is this no clothes that's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:45,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">first guest though no</font>

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:47,100
that's a sweet over here it's a vault

32
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,950
okay i'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that hint it's</font>

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,919
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vault in the basement of</font>

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,420
the Federal Reserve in New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,689
reason I bring this up is this is how I

36
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,340
picture mobile security in what we've

37
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,158
done if you notice this vault looks

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,759
pretty old but it is but it's very

39
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,140
highly secure my pointer doesn't work

40
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,848
anyway you can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way in the</font>

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">back that actually is like a locker room</font>

42
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">seriously there's lockers way in the</font>

43
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">back full of gold it's not our gold it's</font>

44
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,420
all the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries gold but the</font>

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,399
fact is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> door this big door</font>

46
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,958
here it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> two people to open and</font>

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,599
close it they've got to turn the wheels

48
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,250
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time and it rotates so I</font>

49
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,319
thought well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty cool that's</font>

50
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,239
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty secure you need two people</font>

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,869
it's down<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area there's no why I mean</font>

52
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,720
it's way down there but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

53
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,190
is mobile instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this massive</font>

54
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,470
rotating door we're throwing a screen

55
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,650
door on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right we're taking our</font>

56
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,359
already established infrastructures that

57
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,670
we've been tested for years and still

58
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:49,139
can't get sequel injection right but

59
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's beside the point and we're</font>

60
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,730
throwing mobile at it right so now

61
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,030
that's open in a whole nother world of

62
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,690
attacks if you will for numerous reasons

63
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,750
and will kind of get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that</font>

64
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,430
disclaimer the usual please don't just

65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,130
go download and start banging on this

66
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,130
stuff unless you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> permission or bug</font>

67
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,350
bounties or whatever else so what I want

68
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about today is some fingerprint</font>

69
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,108
use cases talk about iOS touch ID

70
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,850
history talk about the api's which

71
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,130
there's not many but we'll talk in depth

72
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,569
about them and show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some demos and</font>

73
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,160
examples so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some use cases for</font>

74
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:32,760
the fingerprint readers on our mobile

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,769
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to be interactive so you</font>

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,149
know if we need alcohol or something

77
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,150
let's let's step it up

78
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:52,910
oh well I could send someone so throw it

79
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:58,010
out throw some use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay device</font>

80
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:07,190
unlocked anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else okay cool</font>

81
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:10,429
anything else there you go sure since

82
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:13,310
the storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe lots of use cases</font>

83
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,670
right it's very very convenient very

84
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,100
easy to use very easy to set up very

85
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,150
easy to program for it in your apps

86
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,250
because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really not a whole lot</font>

87
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:27,909
options so touch ID history it goes back

88
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to 2012 at least with Apple right</font>

89
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,120
biometric sensors and stuff they've been

90
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,770
around forever but<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Apple 2012 is</font>

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,350
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their big point they acquired</font>

92
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,750
authentic and at that point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fanboys</font>

93
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,010
just went nuts oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god we're going to</font>

94
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,580
have fingerprint readers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

95
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:46,130
iPhone well sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough they did so 2013</font>

96
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,229
when the iOS iphone 5s came out it's

97
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh yes touch ID oh by the way you</font>

98
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:54,470
can't use it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your apps ok that's</font>

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,810
interesting okay well we'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font>

100
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer because I'm sure Apple will will</font>

101
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,000
allow us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at some point so</font>

102
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,099
they did in iOS 8 now the apps can use

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,210
the fingerprint sensors and everyone

104
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,970
goes crazy and every app now uses it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

105
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:17,359
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the documentation is absolute</font>

106
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:21,680
crap specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> for iOS has anyone</font>

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:26,330
ever looked it's a nap it's a nap here's

108
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">our documentation use this app so anyway</font>

109
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,510
so they've made<font color="#CCCCCC"> some changes you know</font>

110
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,750
since then and now integrates with a

111
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">keychain and secure Enclave and but it's</font>

112
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:40,160
still by passable by<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical fingerprint</font>

113
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:43,430
attacks or voice or what I can't Google

114
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,560
God they'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> me started so I have</font>

115
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,830
this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> video here of some</font>

116
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,950
unsuspecting person at a con like this

117
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,950
took a nap

118
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,070
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty easy to bypass she's just</font>

119
00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:08,389
trying his fingers well guess what it's

120
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:14,960
not working why why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be uses</font>

121
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:20,169
his foot right yes so you should all use

122
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,169
your footprints instead of fingerprints

123
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,650
so any anyway touch ID technology it

124
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,449
hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed a whole lot since the</font>

125
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,919
first one it's built into the home

126
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:33,740
button even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though the home button is a</font>

127
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:36,680
little weird now on the seven it's still

128
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,930
sapphire crystal pretty darn strong as

129
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,760
far as scratch resistance it uses

130
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,010
capacitive touch so it's not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

131
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,260
image so you can't cut someone's finger

132
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,780
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then go try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to log into their</font>

133
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,060
device right and it's tied at the

134
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,380
hardware level which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very interesting</font>

135
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,110
and good from a security perspective

136
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:58,060
what that means is I can't go steal your

137
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">device grab your chip and put it in mine</font>

138
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,570
right I need the chip and the

139
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,340
fingerprint sensor all in one because

140
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,870
it's tied at the hardware level so if

141
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,388
one goes bad for instance you got to

142
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:13,789
replace the whole gamut<font color="#E5E5E5"> which they'll</font>

143
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:18,710
just say buy a new phone ah no it's just

144
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:22,130
tied at the hardware level correct so

145
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,109
how does it work in iOS so you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

146
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,690
up touch ID and your fingerprints<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

147
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,150
iOS level at the OS level you don't do

148
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,490
it through the application it's a yes or

149
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,250
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology you either succeed or you</font>

150
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,960
fail there's really no<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-between like</font>

151
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,909
oh you almost got there<font color="#CCCCCC"> dude try again</font>

152
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,760
right and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here as</font>

153
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:47,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">I go through this but there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

154
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,580
only two AP is that they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an</font>

155
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,710
iOS 8 and they've they've changed a

156
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,229
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 and 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they really didn't</font>

157
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">make any changes but there's la context</font>

158
00:07:54,229 --> 00:08:01,750
and then user presence anyone here use

159
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:08,020
touch ID in their apps good

160
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:10,780
ah gaar garbage so this is typical

161
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,700
pseudocode ninety percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the apps i</font>

162
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,380
look at and review have code that's

163
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,409
similar to this I wish my pointer worked

164
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,719
so if you follow this code along you see

165
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,820
you have your la context the first thing

166
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,500
it's going to do is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check to</font>

167
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure that the device can actually</font>

168
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,330
use touch ID that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense right that</font>

169
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,979
either has to be enabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> or available on</font>

170
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,719
that device and then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

171
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,250
evaluate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's when you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,830
will pop up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and says hey enter your</font>

173
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,679
finger and then you basically get a

174
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,900
success or<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure so most apps take</font>

175
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,079
that and they if success they do

176
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,770
something authenticate you right or if

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,420
it doesn't then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do something else</font>

178
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:58,829
anyone see a potential issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

179
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:58,829
flow yes

180
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:13,820
so that's really close with iOS from

181
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:17,870
years and years of hacking at it you can

182
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:21,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">run stuff out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of order right if I'm able</font>

183
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,870
to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the app I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run methods</font>

184
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,180
I can instantiate classes I can do

185
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:31,370
things out of order does that give you a

186
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:36,770
hint anyone not you Jack you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't count</font>

187
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:37,570
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this code snippet I'm</font>

188
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through a couple examples</font>

189
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:43,060
it's the same flow checks to whether

190
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,340
device can actually use touch ID

191
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,739
evaluates the policy gets back some

192
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,620
value and what i'm doing here is that if

193
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,660
error show error if success show success

194
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,760
well what's stopping me from connecting

195
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,180
to the app and just running show success

196
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,850
now that could be authenticated it could

197
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:08,930
be something else I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even getting</font>

198
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,090
prompted at that point right so what

199
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,849
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like well I wrote a</font>

200
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,980
really crappy app please no comments I'm

201
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a graphic designer by any means</font>

202
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,850
either and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully this shows up if</font>

203
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:26,090
not you guys can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that here let me</font>

204
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:31,480
run the actual gif and see if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

205
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:31,480
better it means I got to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

206
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:44,120
talk amongst yourselves yeah

207
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:48,290
that's over right all right I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

208
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:53,209
this one yeah it was late last night

209
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,829
wasn't it does that look any better so

210
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:58,540
I'm gonna walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this so what if</font>

211
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is an actual iphone 5s</font>

212
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,790
device that's running my crappy app and

213
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:08,060
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to it over USB I</font>

214
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,829
proxy anyone use it allows me to

215
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,979
actually do things at a conference

216
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,080
without connecting to Wi-Fi but I

217
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,910
videoed it for good reason so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

218
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,820
to connect to the device now this is

219
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:23,329
jailbroken for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that may ask</font>

220
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:26,720
that and you do require jailbroken or

221
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:28,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">rooted access to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do this so</font>

222
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,540
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find the process and thats</font>

223
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:36,170
not show up but what can you do search

224
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,279
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual app process and then i'm</font>

225
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:43,310
gonna use side crypt anyone you sigh

226
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:45,550
crypt no one yeah sai kripa<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lau's me too</font>

227
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,380
attached to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> application and</font>

228
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,449
invoke methods instantiate things look

229
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,660
at memory all that good stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

230
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,950
going to connect to this running app

231
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,219
with side crips i crippled ow's me to

232
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,029
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript and objective-c so i'm</font>

233
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you what this looks like</font>

234
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:06,350
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal use i touch the off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

235
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,990
button use my finger successful if I use

236
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,730
the wrong finger I'm not successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

237
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:15,470
I get canceled and it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> au you fail</font>

238
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,320
that's it that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> my app does show</font>

239
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,240
show air show success so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

240
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,070
invoke them directly from psych ripped

241
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,310
now bypass using the app at all so what

242
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,899
i'm doing here is i'm actually trying to

243
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,520
figure out what my current view is

244
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,079
because that's the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i OS works right</font>

245
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,089
you have a current view at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all times and</font>

246
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,979
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to do that is i'm</font>

247
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the recursive</font>

248
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,850
description and grab some<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory address</font>

249
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,630
that that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here that you can't see</font>

250
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then i'm going to get the next</font>

251
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,720
responder for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that memory address so</font>

252
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,420
like for instance maybe one of those as

253
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,320
a button or a label and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

254
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get the next responder</font>

255
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,150
until I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point where I know</font>

256
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,060
that's the controller I'm looking for

257
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,430
which in this case is just the the

258
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,189
current view controller and in there

259
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,060
here I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pause it what I did</font>

260
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,220
was I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dump the actual methods</font>

261
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,560
that are available to me that you can't

262
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,140
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> but these are actually the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> methods</font>

263
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,589
in this view controller that now I could

264
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,689
invoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's telling me all this</font>

265
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,550
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by connecting to it and one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

266
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,000
those methods is either show success or

267
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:31,560
show error so i can now directly run

268
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,200
those methods with sacred and that's

269
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,280
what i did<font color="#E5E5E5"> here right as you can see</font>

270
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:41,910
this is the memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> address of the view</font>

271
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:44,939
controller with Objective C notation

272
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,969
that's the bracket show success run it

273
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">pop up show success I don't have to do</font>

274
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:54,230
anything with touch ID just went<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

275
00:13:50,730 --> 00:14:00,960
around it so if you're using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> method</font>

276
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:03,560
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not a good idea so let's</font>

277
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,560
close that out

278
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:13,998
go back here so what's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

279
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:16,669
I see well but what if I just pass those

280
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:18,649
values to some other method well that

281
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:20,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't change anything it just makes it</font>

282
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,209
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit harder for me to actually</font>

283
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:25,819
invoke that so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very similar to</font>

284
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:28,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just saw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean checking to see</font>

285
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:30,378
if the device can actually use touch ID

286
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,839
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to evaluate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

287
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:35,179
policy if<font color="#E5E5E5"> again then I respond with the</font>

288
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:36,439
success success and error<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

289
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:38,720
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here is they're passing</font>

290
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:40,879
those values off to show local

291
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:46,519
authentication result and then it does

292
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:49,759
something so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the two main ways</font>

293
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,600
that I see people using because frankly

294
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:57,139
it's copy paste out of the apple app

295
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,059
that they provide you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font>

296
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show this one it's this very very</font>

297
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:05,389
similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I connect to the app</font>

298
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:07,459
get the the current view figure that out

299
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:10,549
and invoke that method the only

300
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:14,089
difference is I now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to guess what</font>

301
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:16,100
the parameters are because as you saw

302
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:19,009
there that that method it takes in two

303
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:22,339
parameters so the easiest way to do that

304
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:27,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">is either one use boolean values or use</font>

305
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:29,029
the nil value and just try those to see

306
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,829
which one's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work because i</font>

307
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:33,409
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily know what</font>

308
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:37,248
objects or what values that that method

309
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:38,989
is expecting but it still does work so

310
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:40,789
then I get the smartass who says oh well

311
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:43,189
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it this way and I'm</font>

312
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:45,499
going to completely ignore all oh oh and

313
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:48,139
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to write the code 75</font>

314
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:50,839
different times in 85 different places

315
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:52,850
right so I'm just going to do if error

316
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,709
I'm going to do everything I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

317
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,579
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here with all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Apple built in</font>

318
00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:01,969
stuff don't do that it doesn't doesn't

319
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:04,519
solve the problem right so who uses it

320
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:09,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">who uses la context evaluate policy</font>

321
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,369
don't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> shy we all probably have yeah</font>

322
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:21,899
how about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cordova Bionic anyone anyone</font>

323
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:26,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">no one does that look familiar this is</font>

324
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:29,699
in ng Cordova so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what Cordova</font>

325
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,069
provides to you to use to use touch ID

326
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:35,008
it's the exact flow that I just went

327
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:38,599
through and actually with Cordova that's

328
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:45,799
the only one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they provide to you</font>

329
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:48,419
about xamarin same thing right now then

330
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,679
xamarin at least calls it kind of what

331
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:53,100
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it says this is local</font>

332
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:56,488
authentication but they say add the

333
00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:01,139
following code to your controller copy

334
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:06,059
paste glam bam you're done so what do we

335
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:14,359
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it any ideas before i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go into</font>

336
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:16,888
them none kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mention it before</font>

337
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:20,908
there are some if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two</font>

338
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:21,958
situations right there are reasons that

339
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:28,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can't think of right now that you may</font>

340
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:30,799
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do local authentication so there</font>

341
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:34,620
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I guess hide it better</font>

342
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,440
security by obscurity you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> define</font>

343
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,879
private methods in objective-c but what

344
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,110
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean it means absolutely</font>

345
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,320
nothing right they're not actually

346
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:47,639
private I can still grab them run them

347
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,330
the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is to avoid static</font>

348
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:54,000
discovery so basically objective-c is a

349
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:57,059
static language I can run strings

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
against it I can print methods and I can

351
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:02,309
get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that info very easily you can</font>

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,070
avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by using dynamic method</font>

353
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:09,600
resolution which is basically the

354
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:11,970
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between this and this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

355
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,240
it's old see notation instead of what

356
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,830
we're used to in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Objective C so all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

357
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">really does though is it turns on</font>

358
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,870
dynamic resolution for that method and

359
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,860
it doesn't really show up in searches

360
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:29,928
even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

361
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:35,309
they're so again it's kind of hiding so

362
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:36,809
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some differences though the</font>

363
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,700
print methods that you couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

364
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:42,240
see before where I was running against

365
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,679
the the actual app to see what the

366
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,860
methods were in the view controller it

367
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,200
does look different if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that</font>

368
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,350
dynamic method resolution so does class

369
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,350
dump anyone use that class up allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

370
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,780
to basically get the classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dump</font>

371
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:01,799
them from the binary and then string

372
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,918
strings is the best tool known to man so

373
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,559
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell you</font>

374
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I do I basically took show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> error</font>

375
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:14,418
and show success and turn those into

376
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:18,840
dynamically dynamic method resolution

377
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:20,010
methods so what I'm what I did here I'm

378
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to play</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it here because it</font>

379
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:26,429
doesn't show up either way is what I'm

380
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,429
going to do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to run that</font>

381
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:32,970
show methods and those actually won't

382
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:35,700
show up now so to me as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Assessor</font>

383
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,220
anyway for<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who may not have the</font>

384
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">code I wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily know that</font>

385
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:45,000
those methods exist anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay again</font>

386
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:49,650
it's not perfect it's one of those if

387
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:57,510
you have to type solutions but there are

388
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:59,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">better ones use pure Swift okay that</font>

389
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,669
means what that means is don't turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

390
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:05,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">the damn objective-c bridge once you do</font>

391
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,380
that all bets are off<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because that</font>

392
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:09,980
gets everything confused and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

393
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:14,929
actually still sort of use<font color="#E5E5E5"> sigh crypt</font>

394
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,929
when that bridge is turned on yeah

395
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:35,340
yes yeah yeah ah introduces more risk it

396
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:40,440
does and it makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very difficult</font>

397
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:42,330
to utilize tools like siterip to to

398
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,220
invoke things directly so from

399
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,439
protecting against that dynamic analysis

400
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,380
if you will of the app Swift is much

401
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,630
better so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far now that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that</font>

402
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone's not coming out with ways to do</font>

403
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:59,340
it it is binary compatible runtime

404
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:01,950
manipulations very limited it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much</font>

405
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,449
harder to analyze so if I'm if I'm

406
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,760
reviewing a swift app it's going to take

407
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,770
me longer to analyze it from a dynamic

408
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,060
perspective because it uses name

409
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:15,060
mangling and things like that which I'll

410
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that means here anyone had</font>

411
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:21,120
any experience with name mangling<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

412
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,469
so if you have a swift binary Matt comes

413
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,699
built in with NM and you can run that

414
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,740
against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the binary you're going to see</font>

415
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,970
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ugly output that looks like</font>

416
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,730
underscore TFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 blah blah blah ok it's</font>

417
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,430
ugly but with that that piece and that

418
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">one line of the hundreds of thousands or</font>

419
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:40,260
whatever dumps from the binary tells me

420
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,670
a lot underscore nurse korte tells me it

421
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a swift method that it's talking</font>

422
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:48,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that it's a function and then c is</font>

423
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:51,120
it's a class method right and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

424
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:55,200
says the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight characters are the</font>

425
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,969
name of the app 14 says the next 14

426
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,890
characters are the name of the actual

427
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:05,520
class s is the type<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay setter or</font>

428
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:07,290
getter so s here means it's a setter 11

429
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,379
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next 11 are the name of the</font>

430
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,780
method and then it's the return<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font>

431
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,990
okay well you can make it easier on

432
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,270
yourself and utilize XC run<font color="#CCCCCC"> to d mangle</font>

433
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,190
app so if i run that against that ugly

434
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,590
string it says okay this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> swift app</font>

435
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,490
view controller user success setter and

436
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:28,970
it returns a swift boolean

437
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:33,950
so again that stuff is still there it's

438
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:37,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">just it's harder to actually manipulate</font>

439
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:41,460
because instead of using cool tools like

440
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:44,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">sigh crypt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to specifically create</font>

441
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,590
hooks and install those on the iOS

442
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,280
device and most of the time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

443
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,199
dynamic and I don't have code I'm

444
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,928
completely guessing so you can imagine

445
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,110
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that would take to figure</font>

446
00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:01,020
out which method or which class I need

447
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,659
to hook and modify the output right so

448
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:07,550
in this case basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm changing the</font>

449
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,600
set success method to always return true

450
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,678
but again how long would that take

451
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:17,070
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually figure out and so on</font>

452
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,380
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth so again it's not a fix-all</font>

453
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:23,419
for everything but it does make it more

454
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:28,350
difficult for someone to actually bypass

455
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:31,230
now Swift is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weird animal because most</font>

456
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:33,719
of the time strings doesn't doesn't give

457
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,760
you much but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reason there's</font>

458
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,980
certain apps like this one i just

459
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">downloaded off the internet real simple</font>

460
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Swift app that uses touch ID and it</font>

461
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,239
actually returns method names I don't

462
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,570
know why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't figured out it</font>

463
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,900
doesn't turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the objective-c bridge</font>

464
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:54,928
so again it's another one of those where

465
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:58,100
it's not a great great solution so

466
00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:06,890
really that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best we can do</font>

467
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:06,889
what is and everyone shy today

468
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:14,830
don't use la context for evaluation of

469
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:18,490
the policy because it's no better local

470
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:22,179
pin but instead we want to use user

471
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:26,650
presence which is basically integrating

472
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:28,600
touch ID in the keychain this was first

473
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,390
implemented in iOS 8 obviously since

474
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,750
that's when programmers were provided

475
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,920
the AP is to utilize touch ID and they

476
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,200
actually improved it a little bit with

477
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,330
iOS 9 and unfortunately didn't touch it

478
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,230
at all with Tim and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about</font>

479
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:46,000
about why I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's unfortunate it</font>

480
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,120
uses here on clay for storage of

481
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,030
fingerprint data and it also uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

482
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,530
for keychain items<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

483
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:58,420
together close-knit family so what's

484
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that look like how's the keychain work</font>

485
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,190
so today this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from Apple</font>

486
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:06,400
documentation so we just believe them

487
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,350
right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically there's bait there's</font>

488
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,140
three lands there's your applications

489
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,659
land which is like user land there's the

490
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,300
OS lamb and then there's the secure

491
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,900
Enclave so your application has<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

492
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:22,240
that it uses the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sec item</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ap is that</font>

493
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,000
have to go through and utilize security

494
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,010
d Damon that has the keychain API is

495
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,480
built into it as well and then it

496
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,830
connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the skier Enclave to grab</font>

497
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,990
whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might need or set whatever</font>

498
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might need in the keychain so</font>

499
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,030
there's like two layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstraction</font>

500
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:40,960
there where you can't directly connect

501
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:43,840
to secure Enclave<font color="#CCCCCC"> and vice versa so</font>

502
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,150
what's it look like with touch ID very

503
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,639
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks the same you have user</font>

504
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,190
space where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still have your same AP</font>

505
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it connects</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the operating system</font>

506
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:57,460
space and it then connects to secure

507
00:25:54,670 --> 00:26:00,310
Enclave which manages<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only the touch</font>

508
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,620
ID evaluation but it manages credential

509
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,780
management key chain management and all

510
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,409
sorts of other good things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

511
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:11,889
aren't directly accessible from your app

512
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:14,740
so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in code iOS 8</font>

513
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,560
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very basic ok when you're setting</font>

514
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,810
up to use touch ID with a keychain item

515
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,970
in iOS 8 you have one option for user

516
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,919
presence and that's Kasich access can

517
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,140
roll user<font color="#CCCCCC"> presence that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's all</font>

518
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,030
they provided that's a yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> or no you're</font>

519
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,950
using it or you're not so when you

520
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,379
create your sexist control reference

521
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,480
object you set that as an attribute and

522
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:40,000
that value in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keychain is now</font>

523
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:42,670
protected with touch ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in iOS 9</font>

524
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,820
and 10 which would 9 is when they added

525
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:50,290
them there were more attribute options

526
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:52,149
added which is awesome they<font color="#E5E5E5"> added the</font>

527
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:54,700
ability to utilize an application-level

528
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:57,000
password instead of touch ID there's a

529
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are worried about touch ID</font>

530
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,840
they allow you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the device</font>

531
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,180
passcode so it'll prompt the user for

532
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,899
the device passcode you can use private

533
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:11,260
keys and then there's the ability to use

534
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,790
touch ID any or touch ID current set can

535
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:19,540
anyone explain the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

536
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:22,540
those two so when I'm creating that<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC</font>

537
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:25,690
access control reference object and say

538
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:28,240
I wanted to use touch ID and I set it to

539
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:30,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">K access control touch ID any that means</font>

540
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,730
at any point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time when I request the</font>

541
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:35,620
data from the keychain any fingerprint

542
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,800
on the system that's registered in iOS

543
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:41,110
will succeed no matter what if one's

544
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,750
removed added whatever else if I set it

545
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:46,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch ID current set it takes kind of</font>

546
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:49,270
a snapshot of the fingerprints that are

547
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,130
assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that device so if anything</font>

548
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:53,470
changes about those whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's remove</font>

549
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,090
two or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> are added the next time I</font>

550
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,820
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that data and it prompts me</font>

551
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:00,340
it will fail the touch ID check because

552
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:05,889
something about the current set has

553
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:07,270
changed does anyone see any issue here

554
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,360
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for someone to say</font>

555
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:13,379
something with these fingerprints in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

556
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,379
way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all managed</font>

557
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,590
is it authentication

558
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:28,400
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> open your Amazon account and</font>

559
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:33,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">prompts you for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch ID is that</font>

560
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:35,450
authentication yeah because it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

561
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,840
anyone's fingerprint that was on the

562
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:41,540
system right so that's why if I'm doing

563
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,810
a review I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> will recommend using</font>

564
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,909
touch ID current set because at least

565
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:49,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a little bit of assurance that</font>

566
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:52,940
the person that's setting it up at this

567
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:54,830
point is registered on the system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

568
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,250
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes that could cause red</font>

569
00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:01,129
flags right but in reality you don't

570
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:03,440
ever really know who's authenticating

571
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:08,590
with touch ID right but we're still

572
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:11,660
using it because it's convenient now

573
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,980
well give in to that so the one couple

574
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,940
things i wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show though with iOS</font>

575
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:19,220
9 and 10 application passwords are a

576
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,020
good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> right because at least then</font>

577
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,540
it's something that that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to</font>

578
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,720
know right that's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab the</font>

579
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,280
data from the keychain so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

580
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,960
to explore using that but then that

581
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,750
bypasses the fact that people want to

582
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,400
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch ID yeah it's not convenient</font>

583
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,900
anymore you already make me use too many

584
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,820
passwords it also has an or function

585
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,700
which people really like where you can

586
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,830
say let's use touch ID current set or if

587
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:51,890
that fails fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an application</font>

588
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:53,659
password that's kind of nice and you

589
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,030
guys don't necessarily need to to see

590
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:01,850
what what it looks like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

591
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:04,550
show you so again my beautiful wonderful

592
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,800
app the keychain stuff is in the bottom

593
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:09,520
so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to enter a value usually</font>

594
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,110
this would be a username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password</font>

595
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,750
and when you click store<font color="#E5E5E5"> two key chain</font>

596
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:18,979
now it's stored next<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I want to get</font>

597
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:21,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm prompted for touch ID that stuff</font>

598
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:24,410
isn't by passable with the tricks that I

599
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,870
showed you before with la context since

600
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,600
everything is being managed in the

601
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:31,550
secure Enclave at this point there's

602
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing for me to necessarily bypass</font>

603
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:35,990
like the only way I can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data is</font>

604
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,900
by successfully using

605
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,330
touch ID which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting right so I</font>

606
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:43,610
use key chain keychain dumper a lot

607
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,770
anyone allows you to dump the keychain

608
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:48,320
items and see everyone's really horrible

609
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:51,530
Wi-Fi passwords that that device is

610
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,840
connected to if anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font>

611
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,850
keychain use touch ID you're going to

612
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,100
get prompted for it because it's trying

613
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,500
to explode the whole thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

614
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,850
interesting one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about too we</font>

615
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:08,059
could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about keychain forever but we</font>

616
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:12,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">want what about the new mac anyone else</font>

617
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:13,850
little scared about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a touch bar in</font>

618
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,330
my opinion it's going to have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

619
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:20,510
issues but now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from what I</font>

620
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:26,020
would consider a single user device to a

621
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:27,890
multi-user system right and what's this

622
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,290
what are they going to do to share

623
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,900
between mac and iOS because frankly that

624
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,480
seems to be where they're going because

625
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,600
max can have its own secure Enclave iOS

626
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,370
has its own well hey let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just check</font>

627
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,419
that box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can save all that data</font>

628
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:47,320
to the cloud good right now I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

629
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:50,030
to throw a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun at you but frankly</font>

630
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,300
IBM tried this in 2004 and failed

631
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:57,920
miserably it's not going to be any

632
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:00,470
different here but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that all I</font>

633
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">need is my little finger to unlock my</font>

634
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:07,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">mac now I told i told The Powers That Be</font>

635
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,409
it at my company I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anyone</font>

636
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,790
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just with</font>

637
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,750
the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data we work with in</font>

638
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,200
whatever else I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think it's</font>

639
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a good idea especially since</font>

640
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,320
most of our people have root access now

641
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:23,270
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this so if you're driving</font>

642
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,189
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the road and get pulled over for</font>

643
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:28,059
speeding they can force you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use your</font>

644
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,440
fingerprint right to unlock<font color="#CCCCCC"> your device</font>

645
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:32,928
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a couple cases about that</font>

646
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,410
they cannot force you to type in your

647
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:38,620
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's gonna be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same for</font>

648
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,620
max

649
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:46,460
something to think about what do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

650
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see I want to see some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

651
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,340
programmatic delineation between

652
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:54,650
fingerprints<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay god damn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I wish</font>

653
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,189
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done it in 10 why I mean</font>

654
00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:00,860
they made no changes from nine to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten I</font>

655
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:03,530
mean here's here's a picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine you</font>

656
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:06,199
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> name it whatever you want there's</font>

657
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:10,040
got to be a way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide some sort of</font>

658
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,050
delineation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose print is what I'm</font>

659
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,970
not going to preach and pretend I know

660
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:17,389
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is but there's got to</font>

661
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:22,370
be a way also fingerprint set up through

662
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:24,260
the app itself so you have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

663
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,919
assurance that it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person</font>

664
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,990
you think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and more attribute</font>

665
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,140
options some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do</font>

666
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:37,190
multi-factor on the device itself would

667
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:42,110
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome right is right now it's not</font>

668
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:44,690
possible and to force set up of using

669
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:47,030
the fingerprint sensor or something

670
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:50,870
right because you can not have a

671
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:54,470
passcode on your device why force the

672
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:56,979
setup of it Apple's good at forcing

673
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:02,450
people to do things why not do that

674
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:05,960
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> summary don't use</font>

675
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:08,210
la context to evaluate the policy use

676
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,970
user presence if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font>

677
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,740
store the username and password send

678
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the backend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server whatever else</font>

679
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:18,199
and authenticate the user maybe it's an

680
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:20,509
OAuth token maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jade up JWT token</font>

681
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:23,149
whatever it is understand it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

682
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,179
authentic ation the setup<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all done</font>

683
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:30,050
through the OS right now with google

684
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:32,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a small ability right to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

685
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:36,679
to force it you but but it's all still

686
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,918
done through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the OS so you like if you</font>

687
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">did the LA context to check if the</font>

688
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,418
device is compatible to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

689
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:47,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and it says no and you know it's an</font>

690
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:49,969
iOS or iphone 5s plus you could be like

691
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,050
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup touch ID that's about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

692
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,928
as you can do

693
00:34:51,050 --> 00:35:00,440
right and then they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out into</font>

694
00:34:53,929 --> 00:35:01,340
the OS and set up touch ID and I really

695
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,930
hope there's going to be more to come

696
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,930
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple here i mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

697
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:09,460
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's a problem that's just kind</font>

698
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:11,569
of blown under the rug it can be better

699
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,180
to provide more assurance because

700
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:17,030
everyone's using it for authentication

701
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,370
you name it they're using it so I i

702
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,580
really hope soon that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen</font>

703
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:26,859
maybe with 11 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically mobile</font>

704
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:29,860
securities hard try harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

705
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,860
thanks

706
