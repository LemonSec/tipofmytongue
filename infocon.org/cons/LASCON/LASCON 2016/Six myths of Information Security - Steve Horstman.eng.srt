00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well dive in and talk a little bit</font>

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,880
about mythology on information security

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:28,010
first here's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font>

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,689
about me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contact me I'm</font>

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,280
certainly not up here to tell you that I

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,780
have all the answers about the topics

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,400
we're going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> today I'd like</font>

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this to be the first part of the</font>

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,269
conversation and so please reach out to

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,650
me as comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> or questions if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a chance to do it today and I do</font>

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,360
think we'll have time for questions at

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,640
the end then here's some various ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,320
contact me we'd love to for this to be a

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,500
part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our longer-term conversation</font>

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,090
with all of you I do ask that you hold

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,370
off on any comments or<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions until</font>

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,870
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk like I say I think</font>

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,089
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have plenty of time for that but I</font>

21
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,829
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that we get through</font>

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,089
all six<font color="#E5E5E5"> meals so we'll go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and get</font>

23
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:06,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">started one common thread that's going</font>

24
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,380
to run through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all six of these myths is</font>

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,340
that the words we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter as</font>

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,490
professionals in the industry we

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,009
ourselves and the others<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to our</font>

28
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,780
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> choose words wisely the</font>

29
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,399
words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use impact our attitudes</font>

30
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,170
they impact our actions and more

31
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:23,420
importantly they packed the attitudes

32
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,890
and actions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our audience and so we</font>

33
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,289
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful and thoughtful about</font>

34
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,580
the words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use and what that</font>

35
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:34,610
meaning that conveys so myth number one

36
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,959
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is such a thing as security we</font>

37
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,310
call ourselves information security

38
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,869
professionals we've seen the word

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,300
security thrown around a lot at this

40
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,160
conference but is there such a thing and

41
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">do we do ourselves a little bit of a</font>

42
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,880
disservice by using the term so freely

43
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:48,229
so we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about that I</font>

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,720
have to warn you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this myth will take</font>

45
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:52,550
longer than all the others<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,399
really gets the heart of what we do and

47
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,450
who we are so a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of examples I</font>

48
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,880
want to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the first ones</font>

49
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,550
parenting to talk about the the myth of

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,679
security and how it impacts us so most

51
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,860
new parents know instinctively that

52
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:08,330
their number one job is to protect this

53
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,959
new defenseless creature that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

54
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,180
responsibility for and it's true our job

55
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,640
as parents are our most important job is

56
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,290
to provide safety to our children right

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,269
so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct of course it is and</font>

58
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,328
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all wrap our children in</font>

59
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,950
bubble wrap and lock them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rooms</font>

60
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> would never let them do anything</font>

61
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,010
crazy like play sports or riding the car

62
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,480
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

63
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,340
things are statistically dangerous we

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,220
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely show that if you're chill</font>

65
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,769
up child plays sports they're likely to

66
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,299
get hurt at some point and yet we let

67
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,400
our kids do all sorts of dangerous

68
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,079
things in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in that picture</font>

69
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,640
in the upper<font color="#E5E5E5"> left-hand corner that kids</font>

70
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,440
actually putting his hand in fire and

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">some adults taking a picture instead of</font>

72
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,870
stopping them but somehow we we allow

73
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,858
that to happen and the reason is is that

74
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,209
our instincts are wrong that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact we</font>

75
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:01,280
don't have the primary job of providing

76
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:03,530
security it's it's a definite component

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,720
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take that to an extreme we can</font>

78
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,489
do our children<font color="#CCCCCC"> to service we deny them</font>

79
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,430
a lot of the opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

80
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,560
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise have and so security</font>

81
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,659
though we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it may be our objective</font>

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,069
really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our objectives is more to</font>

83
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,540
find a balance for our children's lives

84
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,819
and we'll see that as a theme throughout

85
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,638
this let's see if we can find another

86
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:27,738
example of where the word security leads

87
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:32,389
us to maybe a bad path so global

88
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:33,980
security agencies there's a huge civil

89
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:36,470
rights debate going on not just in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

90
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,328
US but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> around many parts of the</font>

91
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,010
world right now on privacy versus

92
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,750
security and then we hear it more in our

93
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,370
industry than in others but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

94
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,060
certainly become a topic for a popular

95
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,280
press as well and to be honest I feel

96
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,660
for these agencies the conversation

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,970
generally goes something like this

98
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,980
citizens say there's all these horrible

99
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,199
things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and these things are</font>

100
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,660
absolutely horrible governments protect

101
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,720
us from these horrible things protect us

102
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,470
no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> what give us security and</font>

103
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,209
governments create these security

104
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,480
agencies and these security agencies say

105
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok to secure you absolutely I need to be</font>

106
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,448
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your data I need a</font>

107
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">giant portion of your GDP and then maybe</font>

108
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can do something about security and</font>

109
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,789
that the fact is the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

110
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,918
off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong start because we're</font>

111
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,260
focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on security absolute security is</font>

112
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,060
it possible we live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a dangerous world</font>

113
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,979
and as horrible as these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

114
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,840
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that any government can</font>

115
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:32,150
do to absolutely guarantee our safety

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,799
from them and so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> start from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

117
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,510
different path if we start the

118
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,639
conversation not about we need security

119
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">but about we need some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of balance</font>

120
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:44,480
between funds that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to provide</font>

121
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">between privacy and between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> safety</font>

122
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,630
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a balancing act and</font>

123
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,109
then it becomes a more useful

124
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,550
conversation we end up more in sync with

125
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,170
the security agencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're working</font>

126
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:59,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">with so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really there's two problems with</font>

127
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the word security the first is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

128
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,710
puts the group in charge of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,240
odds with whoever's asking for it

130
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">because rarely when someone asks for</font>

131
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,110
security is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually what they want</font>

132
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,730
really what they want is some sort of

133
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,140
balance between taking risks and and

134
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,420
some benefit that those risks might

135
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,620
provide and the other problem with using

136
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,690
the word security is that it's

137
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,160
absolutely impossible we do live in a

138
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,480
dangerous world and none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us can</font>

139
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,790
provide security we can't provide

140
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,290
security as parents as governments and

141
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,240
not as information security

142
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,830
professionals so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

143
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,130
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for is a balance and so is there</font>

144
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,840
a term that's better to talk about to

145
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,580
imply that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're looking for is</font>

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">this balance and to admit from the very</font>

147
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,950
beginning of a conversation that

148
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:47,840
security isn't possible could it<font color="#CCCCCC"> be risk</font>

149
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:49,969
management you bet it is and so let's

150
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,919
all this applies to information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

151
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,340
as well it applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us in the</font>

technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk realm we put ourselves</font>

153
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,359
at odds with businesses when wherever we

154
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,250
try and take our role as security<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

155
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,990
seriously I know when I was a new

156
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,580
security professional newly ordained

157
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,290
pulled in from a software development

158
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,590
job and told you're now in charge of

159
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">security for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this organization I thought</font>

160
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,810
okay great I'll start<font color="#E5E5E5"> making decisions</font>

161
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help secure the organization and so I</font>

162
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,990
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling people know when they</font>

163
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">started taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk that I thought were</font>

164
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,880
we're going too far and and I was the

165
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,469
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> maker and quickly the CIO</font>

166
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,750
started referring to the department as

167
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> department of now Engineers start</font>

168
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,660
and developers started to try and work

169
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,520
around us instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with us</font>

170
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we said no instead of being</font>

171
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,799
partners in a relationship and then I

172
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,930
realized that this isn't my decision I'm

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,460
not the decision maker here and I can't

174
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,260
enforce the<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the company</font>

175
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,750
actually doesn't want absolute security

176
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,039
companies take risks naturally<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

177
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,320
what they do that's how they make money

178
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,030
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though they might declare</font>

179
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're the security people and and</font>

180
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,750
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> senior business they think that</font>

181
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,730
they want absolute security when they

182
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,260
actually understand that it the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

183
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,340
involved

184
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,570
it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font>

185
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,609
want is some sort of risk management

186
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,500
they want to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that balance between</font>

187
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:08,900
being able to take educated and informed

188
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk and some some level of safety so</font>

189
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,239
talked a little bit about risk

190
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,380
management I want to take a little bit

191
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,990
of time to go through the risk

192
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,150
management process and for any of you

193

that we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Karen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loo and Josh Sokol's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talk yesterday this this will kind of</font>

195
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,960
amplify some of what they talked about I

196
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,700
take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a little bit different</font>

197
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,880
perspective but a lot of this the same

198
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,590
bullet points we're going to hit so this

199
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's many different types of</font>

200
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,739
risk management processes this is the

201
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,860
one that we've implemented the company

202
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,870
i'm at now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me I think</font>

203
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was slight changes this works for</font>

204
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,400
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations so this was run</font>

205
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,030
through it so first<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in at risk</font>

206
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">management is to identify the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk and</font>

207
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,539
also and I should explicitly<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

208
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">there to assess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk and I think</font>

209
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,300
this naturally comes to us as

210
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,460
information security professionals this

211
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,810
is what we do anyway there's not much

212
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,599
difference here between information

213
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and risk management but in the</font>

214
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">next step there is where we start to</font>

215
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">diverge a little bit so historically in</font>

216
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,250
the information security realm we feel

217
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,990
like it's our<font color="#E5E5E5"> job to address the risk</font>

218
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we go off and we implement</font>

219
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,370
controls or we would stop software

220
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:17,419
releases or we do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to in</font>

221
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:19,160
order to mitigate risk but I proposes

222
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,590
risk managers our job is to advise and

223
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to become trusted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advisors within our</font>

224
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:27,109
organization and work with the actual

225
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,810
decision makers in deciding which way we

226
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to go in order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to address for us so</font>

227
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,760
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the advise as</font>

228
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,380
opposed to the address so how do we do

229
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,849
advise people to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk there's</font>

230
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,110
four options I'll run through<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

231
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,790
really quick I think most of your pretty

232
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,180
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the first is to avoid</font>

233
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,550
risk most of the time avoiding risk

234
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,250
involves working through processes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

235
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,069
process re-engineering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classic</font>

236
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,290
example and unfortunately one that we've

237
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,730
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before is you work with the vendor</font>

238
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,560
who's going to send out mailers to your

239
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,360
to your customers and so they asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

240
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">a feat of your customer list you're</font>

241
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the feed that they asked</font>

242
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">for and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

243
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,470
number how do you need social security

244
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,550
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send out a mailer well we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

245
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,350
needed a unique ID to identify

246
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,849
honey<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm not going to use social</font>

247
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,950
security number will send you something

248
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,570
different and simply by changing that

249
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,310
one little<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a slight</font>

250
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">reengineering of that business process</font>

251
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,729
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can completely avoid a risk reduced</font>

252
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,170
risk comes it's for me the more

253
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,279
enjoyable<font color="#E5E5E5"> part this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really where we</font>

254
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,349
get technical this is where we're

255
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,970
hardening our systems this is where

256
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,339
we're identifying bugs in our software

257
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,670
and working with developers to plug

258
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,649
those holes so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> reducing risk</font>

259
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> implies applying some sort of</font>

260
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:41,279
technical control it's also implementing

261
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,329
new software or a new software that

262
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">provides controls new tools transfer</font>

263
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:49,469
risk so this is the rare one it's the

264
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,850
really only valid example I've ever

265
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,010
heard is purchasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security</font>

266
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,779
insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's made more at a corporate</font>

267
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,339
level it's not something that applies on

268
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,140
risk that you really see on a day-to-day

269
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,029
basis the only thing worth mentioning on

270
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,220
transfer risk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it should never be</font>

271
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,079
confused with outsourcing outsourcing

272
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,720
does not transfer risk to the to the

273
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">outsourced party you still maintain that</font>

274
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,470
risk if something goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong your</font>

275
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,480
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> still associate the data with</font>

276
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,480
you not with whoever us or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

277
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,520
set something to be careful of<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

278
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,589
last except rescues information security

279
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,060
professionals we just always oh that's

280
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:22,560
not at me when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are willing to</font>

281
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,779
accept risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just st. always seemed</font>

282
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,550
insane to me but as a risk management

283
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,950
professional there's a lot of reasons to

284
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,329
etc sand the most common one is that we

285
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,370
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the staff of the budget right</font>

286
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,810
now to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and when we don't</font>

287
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe because we're working on higher</font>

288
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,880
priority risks and it's part of our

289
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,189
responsibility to be trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisors</font>

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,110
then it an advice honestly on risk and

291
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,329
recognize the limitations of our

292
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,459
companies when it comes to staffing and

293
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,380
to resources and so it may make sense to

294
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,000
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we don't have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> resources to</font>

295
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,620
address this now how about in six months

296
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,690
let's set a<font color="#CCCCCC"> date let's set a goal and</font>

297
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,120
then we accept the risk but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for a</font>

298
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,800
short time<font color="#CCCCCC"> period something that we can</font>

299
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,329
all agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can negotiate that</font>

300
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,180
we can push to make it aggressive and

301
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:05,069
reasonable but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of cases</font>

302
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,859
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes sense to accept risk for</font>

303
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,180
some period

304
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,100
but accepting risk really doesn't end

305
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,930
there because the other role that we

306
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,230
have is risk managers is not only to

307
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,520
allow groups to accept risk but to make

308
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,200
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the right individuals within</font>

309
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,870
the company are accepting a risk and so

310
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,640
take the example if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a division</font>

311
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,950
manager that's committed to roll out a

312
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,330
new product it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a piece of</font>

313
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,779
software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sits in the DMZ</font>

314
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">customer-facing and we test it and a</font>

315
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,080
week before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's supposed to roll out we</font>

316
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,359
find out it's got enough holes for a

317
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,600
truck to roll through there's it's just

318
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,220
a security nightmare and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this</font>

319
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,540
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the division manager he says</font>

320
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,040
we've committed to our customers we've

321
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,560
committed to our investors I'm willing

322
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,140
to accept this risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the problem that</font>

323
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,630
scenario is that if somebody ends up

324
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,310
owning that server then they can use

325
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a foothold to get to the rest of</font>

328
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,770

329
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,600
as risk professionals to escalate that

330
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,640
to the proper level<font color="#CCCCCC"> and organization to</font>

331
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,500
make sure that someone who has that

332
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,069
broader view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the whole risk to the</font>

ones to make that risk a risk acceptance

cases is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we escalate to the</font>

management risk management process as a

350
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,320
whole but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not done there so even</font>

351
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:54,170
if we would completely addressed the

352
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,150
risk by some combination and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,750
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that these</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">advise they're not mutually exclusive a</font>

358
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,410
implement controls either through

359
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,150
process re-engineering or implementing a

360
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,430
technical control or even a

361
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,890
purchasing insurance we need something

362
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,050
in place to monitor that control its

363
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,580
effectiveness the simple truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

364
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,189
effectiveness of controls if they're

365
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,680
unwatched will degrade over time it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

366
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,720
happens businesses change people stop

367
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,660
watching it somehow that control is

368
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,420
going to become defective and so what we

369
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do is as we are initially in</font>

370
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,030
that advised<font color="#E5E5E5"> phase we need to be honest</font>

375
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,360
continuous and automated we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have people checking on</font>

377
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,320
manual processes we don't want to have

378
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,190
people manually running through logs we

want something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to</font>

380

of implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a little bit</font>

382
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,560
high upfront but it pays off over the

383
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,380
time and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that that</font>

384
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that time frame is incorporated</font>

385
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:09,050
into any controls that we agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to with</font>

386
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,760
with our clients and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then finally</font>

387
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,859
renewal of risks already mentioned that

388
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,140
when wrists are accepted very often

389
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,600

important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we hope to put some</font>

391
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,900

changes business<font color="#E5E5E5"> conditions change and</font>

399
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,730
so particularly for any high risks that

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,610
are accepted those need to have some

type<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exploration associated with it</font>

here information security it leads us

433
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,410
astray it sets us up with an impossible

434
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,760
mission and leaves us frustrate at the

435
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,990
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day because people are going</font>

to accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrist and they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

437
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you secure the organization the ways</font>

that you think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be but and</font>

439
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,970
there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough bubble wrap to</font>

440
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,430
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that baby no matter how much we</font>

441
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,170
add but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day risk</font>

442
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,430
management gives us a path to find that

443
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,199
balance the right balance for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

444
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,329
organization because all organizations

445
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,250
need to accept risk and if we follow a

446
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,620
solid risk management process than it

447
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:22,450
helps us find what the right level of

448
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,450
risk acceptance is for our companies

449
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay myth number two there's a cyber war</font>

450
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,360
going on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one drives me a little</font>

451
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,890
bit nuts and unfortunately it's going to

452
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,180
draw them even more nuts as tensions

453
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:38,770
raised between Russia and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

454
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the DNC and and other cyber attacks and</font>

455
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,340
I guess it doesn't bother<font color="#E5E5E5"> me too much</font>

456
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,579
that we've come over the last few years

457
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,470
to add the word cyber to just about any

458
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,360
type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of verb or now that we can find</font>

459
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,240
anywhere and sometimes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

460
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,710
sometimes it's not but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we</font>

461
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,200
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful to pay attention to</font>

462
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:01,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route work whenever</font>

463
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,230
we add cyber to it we should lose

464
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,060
meaning whenever we add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

465
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,010
we'll run through a few words that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

466
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,510
often add cyber to and let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look</font>

467
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,099
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the root word really means and</font>

468
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,740
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make sure that we as</font>

469
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:15,290
professionals continue to keep fidelity

470
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:19,959
with that meaning as we use the word and

471
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:21,349
can the cyber context so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is war</font>

472
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,470
it's

473
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:27,829
death on massive scales it's absolutely

474
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,140
horrific event and so when I hear cyber

475
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,570
war this is what I think of and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

476
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,309
not what we see in our day-to-day lives

477
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly there are smart bombs and</font>

478
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,460
smart bullets but it's ultimately

479
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:41,000
bullets and bombs that kill people in

480
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">wars it's not computers and so even</font>

481
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,799
though we use computers more and more

482
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,000
and more fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the term cyber war</font>

483
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,070
 needs something a little bit

484
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,620
different and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we devalue</font>

485
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,168
the word war when we associate when we

486
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,870
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber war so freely all of a sudden</font>

487
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">we become numb to it as a society and we</font>

488
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,709
think that cyber war something that we

489
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:03,559
can accept or ignore that's just

490
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,559
commonplace and unavoidable it's a

491
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,450
dangerous path and much rather leaves

492
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,039
the term for something that's a much

493
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,850
more monumental than what were you how

494
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,289
we're using it today assassination so I

495
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,830
occasionally hear the words cyber

496
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:20,450
assassination thrown about and you might

497
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,918
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it drone strike and</font>

498
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,659
assassination though it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in the</font>

499
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,580
end like I said it's a bullet<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bomb</font>

500
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:27,830
that's causing the damage it's not

501
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,780
computers there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been some very</font>

502
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,490
interesting research and the tax on

503
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,379
medical devices or vehicles that could

504
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,809
potentially be used in some type of

505
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,090
assassination attempt by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a cyber</font>

506
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,250
assassination right now luckily it's

507
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,780
more theoretical than it is reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

508
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,700
so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a word that we need to</font>

509
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,889
be a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> careful with when we add</font>

510
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:51,230
cyber to it so we don't distort the

511
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:53,690
meaning propaganda so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an area</font>

512
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">where i can i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can understand the use of</font>

513
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,470
the phrase cyber propaganda a little bit

514
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,500
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> islamic state's been extremely</font>

515
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:03,110
successful in using social media to

516
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,520
recruit and to spread the propaganda and

517
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,168
so we see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more it's</font>

518
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,940
something that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely is as</font>

519
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,679
security professionals as risk

520
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,570
professionals need to be aware of it and

521
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,210
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be prepared to combat and so</font>

522
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:17,240
cyber propaganda gets us closer to the

523
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,210
realm of where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

524
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,299
phrasing and then espionage spying

525
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,770
stealing information ninety-nine point

526
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,750
nine percent of the time when i see the

527
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:29,299
phrase cyber war or cyber assassination

528
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,480
we're really talking about is cyber

529
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:34,429
espionage and i think again as security

530
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,600
professionals as risk professionals

531
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:38,029
should be careful in the words that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

532
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,100
use and I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see us use cyber</font>

533
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:42,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">espionage much more and replace cyber</font>

534
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,779
war with it's a much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest telling</font>

535
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:50,090
of and description of what we're talking

536
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:51,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">about and then sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we add cyber to</font>

537
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,459
something that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a filled TV show</font>

538
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:57,470
and very disappointing so the sum up

539
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,730
cyber war we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen one yet we</font>

540
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,350
shouldn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it like it's a real</font>

541
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,259
thing or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that exists it might</font>

542
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,879
come about<font color="#CCCCCC"> someday I hope not but we</font>

543
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:06,559
should still use the word with a little

544
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of hesitancy we should use it with a</font>

545
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,690
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reverence and we should</font>

546
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,700
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

547
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,809
absolutely avoid it's not something

548
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">commonplace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his words matter the next</font>

549
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:19,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">two we'll talk about will take together</font>

550
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:22,279
it's all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication with three</font>

551
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:24,529
the password is dead then a lot and then

552
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,210
also hear people talk about two factors

553
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:27,499
is it necessarily solves every

554
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication problem that they've ever</font>

555
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:31,070
come across and so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

556
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,699
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit and dive in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

557
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:36,200
bit more deeply and first just the quick

558
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,730
recap of sure you all know there's

559
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,019
traditionally three factors of

560
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication something you know</font>

561
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:43,490
something you have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

562
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:47,119
are lots of talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fourth or fifth</font>

563
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:49,039
factor where you are how you behave it

564
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,259
gets into semantics that we won't dive

565
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,440
into today let's stick with it three

566
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:57,019
factors their traditional so password is

567
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,679
dead we hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the time plenty of</font>

568
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,779
press declares that lots of vendors say

569
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,700
that their product kills passwords and

570
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:07,070
really when I look at those products at

571
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart of them somewhere at an</font>

572
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:13,220
administrative level there's usually a

573
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,899
password they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to keep</font>

574
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,309
end-users away from passwords a little

575
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,129
bit they may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to distract from</font>

576
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:20,658
passwords but certainly you can't call

577
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:22,908
the password dad at the same time you

578
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:25,129
release a product that uses passwords

579
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:28,100
and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little</font>

580
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:29,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit careful there um but passwords do</font>

581
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,119
have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems and I don't want</font>

582
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:33,980
to gloss over the subject to make them

583
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,869
long enough so that they can't be easily

584
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,279
brute<font color="#E5E5E5"> forest and then users can't</font>

585
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:39,049
remember them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worse</font>

586
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,029
climate change it all the time as they

587
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,289
write it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a post-it note all the</font>

588
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:44,539
problems that everybody complains about

589
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,950
are absolutely true but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we</font>

590
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:47,119
declare the password dead we need to

591
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,460
think a little bit about what are all

592
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,129

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">other factors something that you have so</font>

596
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,010
something you have actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> started out</font>

597
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,779
the first time I heard about it was

598
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,210
sheets of paper with random numbers

599
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,860
printed on them and so when you log into

600
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,200
a system you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the next random</font>

601
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,549
number type it in scratch it off so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

602
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,720
you know the next time you looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

603
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">next number on that sheet of paper</font>

604
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,500
obviously very cumbersome and

605
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,850
error-prone all rights they change

606
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,179
things and brought made it all more

607
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,889
commonplace so with this pure ID most of

608
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,330
us remember those devices and had them

609
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,539
at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone's probably still</font>

610
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,980
do the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with secure IDs or</font>

611
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,330
one of the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with secure IDs was</font>

612
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,760
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only used it when you</font>

613
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,500
authenticated you leave it at home<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">your nightstand half the time because</font>

615
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,600
didn't need it for anything else and so

616
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,220
we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving to SMS messages it was</font>

617
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,230
nice she almost always carried your

618
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,779
phone with you we're much more cognizant

619
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,840
of that of course SMS isn't encrypted

620
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,190
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people have SMS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> texts show</font>

621
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,689
up on their phone even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the screens</font>

622
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,029
locked so there's some problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

623
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,860
that so we moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to phone apps and</font>

624
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:54,390
that's a much better solution we do

625
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,000
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember to carry our phones</font>

626
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,679
with us most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time and with apps</font>

627
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,950
we can address the screen lock problem

628
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,779
the encryption problem it helps but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

629
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,940
inherent problems with something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

630
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,620
you have just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like passwords are you</font>

631
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,179
can't be avoided no matter what

632
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,279
technology we use you can absolutely

633
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">lose it and the bigger problem is</font>

634
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else can obtain it and no matter</font>

635
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,149
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is something you have those</font>

636
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,889
two problems exist and we can mitigate

637
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:22,649
those risks but they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> always exist</font>

638
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,970
so just like passwords something you

639
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:25,830
have just not like something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

640
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:30,120
something you have comes with some

641
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,740
inherent limitations biometrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

642
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give biometrics a lot of credit</font>

643
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,850
remember not too many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago thinking</font>

644
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:37,830
that it was pie in the sky and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

645
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">would never see it now every one of us</font>

646
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:44,039
logs into our phones constantly using

647
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,659
almost solely biometrics they've

648
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,860
definitely come a long way they're much

649
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,990
more effective than they used to be

650
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,870
they're much more usable they're much

651
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,370
more cost effective but biometrics also

652
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,020
come with some inherent problems first

653
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,090
of all there's this constant arms race

654
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,399
as good as they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're certainly</font>

655
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,379
not perfect and you know it started out

656
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:02,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">as fingerprint readers on on lap</font>

657
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,040
hops that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could bypass with a little</font>

658
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of scotch tape pretty easily and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

659
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,610
the fingerprint readers are better but

660
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,199
there's still plenty of ways of

661
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,639
bypassing fingerprint readers and most

662
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,010
of our phones that you can find out on

663
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,450
the internet every time I see a

664
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,280
publication<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a great new biometric</font>

665
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,070
technique that either lowers costs or

666
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,660
introduces the new method a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

667
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">later see a security researcher that's</font>

668
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,830
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way around it and so we have to</font>

669
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,230
recognize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bot there's an arms</font>

670
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,939
race with biometrics and can't

671
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,020
necessarily bet on it because there's

672
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,660
still a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being done there</font>

673
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,510
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with biometrics is how</font>

674
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,060
do you reset your fingerprint if I lose

675
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:41,970
my password I can reset that if I lose

676
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:44,460
my phone I can cancel<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and get another</font>

677
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">one but if I lose control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

678
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:50,550
fingerprint or my iris or retinal images

679
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,169
or my DNA how do I get that back how do

680
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,750
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> reset that how do I get control over</font>

681
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,430
it again and so that's another concern

682
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,200
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in mind with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

683
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,300
biometrics and so all three of our

684
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,670
traditional factors have inherent

685
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,680
problems it doesn't mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font>

686
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,870
use them we have to they're the only

687
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,090
options that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have but it does mean</font>

688
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,709
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> careful</font>

689
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,090
but then is an industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decided okay</font>

690
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,440
so if all three factors have these

691
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,379
inherent problems that we can't get away

692
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,450
from then we'll just combine them with

693
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,890
it that solves all the problems right

694
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,520
and so we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use multi-factor</font>

695
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:25,440
multi-factor fixes everything but does

696
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,090
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suggests that there's two</font>

697
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,710
problems with with declaring that

698
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,959
multi-factor solves all the

699
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,860
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues the first problem</font>

700
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that all that every time we use</font>

701
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,530
authentication it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how you</font>

702
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,760
implement the factors if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use a</font>

703
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:45,510
multi-factor authentication system that

704
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,120
has a 46 character alphanumeric password

705
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,490
along with a fingerprint reader that I

706
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,989
can bypass with some scotch tape did

707
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,660
that really<font color="#CCCCCC"> make me more secure than a</font>

708
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,120
strong password maybe it depends on the

709
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,530
threats that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid but</font>

710
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,969
it's certainly not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of strength</font>

711
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,010
of security we generally think of when

712
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,330
we think of a multi-factor the other

713
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,850
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with multi factor is that</font>

714
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,010
doesn't necessarily stop all all attacks

715
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,689
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

716
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,520
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're trying to prevent</font>

717
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,020
the threats that you're facing when

718
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,780
you're designing your authentication

program so take a traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> phishing</font>

720
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,330
attack that we see all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time set up a</font>

721
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,040
great multi-factor strong multi-factor

authentication mechanism for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my end</font>

723
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,480
users and user receives a link to a web

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,420
page they go to a web page<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks</font>

725
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,670
exactly like my applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in they</font>

726
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,470
dutifully enter their username their

727
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,960
strong password they pull up their app

728
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:40,200
on the phone and enter the token from it

729
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,580
and they hit submit and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hackers</font>

730
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,990
immediately have all the credentials

731
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,740
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn around it and</font>

00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">login as that end user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's a pretty</font>

733
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,550
common attack that just by declaring

734
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,960
multi-factor we don't we don't avoid or

735
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,960
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from there are</font>

736
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,100
ways to to defend against this type of

737
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,540
attack but we need to be thoughtful

738
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">about is this what we're worried about</font>

739
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">and are we willing to invest in the</font>

740
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:07,530
right defense and so we have duo as a

741
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:09,930
vendor here they've got a great of a

742
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,420
syndication mechanism that they sell

743
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,680
you'll pay for it it costs and there's

744
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,930
plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other vendors that use the</font>

745
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,000
depth of off as well and they help

746
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,530
defend against these types of attacks by

747
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,210
changing the number of factors<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

748
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,560
types of factors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

750
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,730

751
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,080
when it comes to designing an

752
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,610
authentication system you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

753
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,659
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> your threats we can't just</font>

754
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:35,580
blindly declare that we're using multi

755
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,230
factors that fixes all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the all the</font>

756
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,760
issues which factors are we using why

757
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,820
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we using and why do we select those</font>

758
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,760
and do they address the<font color="#E5E5E5"> threats that</font>

759
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're facing it with our systems and so</font>

760
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,300
I'd suggest that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a term that it's a</font>

761
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,070
little bit more descriptive a little bit

762
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,830
more helpful is actually threat driven

763
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,990
authentication so if you tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

764
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a multi-factor system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it</font>

765
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,190
tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit but if you tell me</font>

766
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you have a system that's driven by</font>

767
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,340
a by you through your threats then all

768
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,200
of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know you've thought about</font>

769
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">it I may not know how secure the system</font>

770
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,010
necessarily is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily know</font>

771
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,990
what you're using in order to implement

772
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication system but at least I</font>

773
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,110
know that you put some thought into the

774
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,240
threats that your organization's facing

775
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,949
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your systems facing and that you've</font>

776
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,200
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to design defenses around those</font>

777
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that level of thoughtfulness</font>

778
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,190
is what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold ourselves to is</font>

779
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,590
secure

professionals we can't just decide that

781
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,709
passwords are dead but the two-factor

782
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,690
fixes everything we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really be</font>

we're facing and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

787
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,510
useless another one that I've heard

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,890
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first got into the security</font>

789
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:46,930
industry and and and took for granted

790
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,360
when i first started<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing it but then</font>

791
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,730
the more I looked around the more I

792
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,949
started the question that's it this one

793
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,110
should be pretty easy to address<font color="#CCCCCC"> very we</font>

794
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,390
could raise your hand if on your public

795
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,280
web page you publish a complete network

798
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,640
organization and that's kind of what i

799
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,010
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nobody's going to raise</font>

800
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,660
their hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but that ultimately</font>

801
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:13,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just security through obscurity we're</font>

not we don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that a</font>

informations the first steps in the kill

805
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,040
chain and attackers are actually pretty

806
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,530
good at gathering that information up

807
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,730
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time we aren't</font>

that page for a lot of software it's a

860
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,490
little bit more challenging and so we

861
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,110
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these these rats a lot of</font>

862
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this ransomware is not able to get out</font>

863
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,229
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the command and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

864
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">servers that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

865
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,120
talk to and so it stops the attack right

866
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:19,280
there and of course again it's not

867
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,229
unnatural could you write software that

868
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,660
gets around that<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely is it</font>

869
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,070
happening I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know probably but if</font>

870
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,840
it's up some percentage of it that's

871
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,850
still in a good control<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to</font>

872
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">consider in our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arsenal but the third</font>

873
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,780
benefit that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from the proxy</font>

874
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,179
server speed bump is information so if

875
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,280
you see an<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint calling out to an</font>

00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,260
unclassified site<font color="#CCCCCC"> one hundred five</font>

878
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,470
just really a determined in jeez they're

tryin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to some random site</font>

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,620
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of malware on your</font>

881
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,120
system that's a pretty reliable

882
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,590
indicator to compromise and something

883
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you absolutely need to be looking</font>

884
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:53,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">into and so something as simple as a</font>

885
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,159
proxy server speed bump actually

886
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,889
provides quite a bit of security when we

887
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,800
look at it can all that be bypassed

888
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,570
absolutely but but it still provides

889
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,020
value to your organization really what

890
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,189
it comes down to is layers of Defense

891
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,620
most of the controls we implement

892
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,240
unfortunately simply aren't one hundred

893
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,590
percent effective absolutely your

894
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,730
firewall if you tell it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to block and</font>

895
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,250
port it's going to block that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

896
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:20,120
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but most of the controls</font>

897
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,620
whether it's it's a antivirus or our DLP

898
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,570
or anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we might implement</font>

899
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,600
as a security measure in our environment

900
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,850
it only has degrees of effectiveness and

901
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,639
we fight that that fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not</font>

902
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:33,649
fully effective by implementing layered

903
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,910
defenses okay so this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

904
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,830
fully effective than we use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

905
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,840
combination with additional controls and

906
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,280
obscurity is no different than any of

907
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,029
those other controls that aren't fully

908
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,559
effective absolutely it can

909
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:45,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">workaround</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely it can be bypassed</font>

910
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,639
but used in conjunction with other

911
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:50,580
controls it's a strong measure to slow

912
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:52,709
down your attacker may be diverting to

913
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,629
an easier target and definitely give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a chance to find him and</font>

916
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:03,899

917
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:06,210
chain and then myth number six<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

918

theater accomplishes nothing and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

919
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,719
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to research this and the first</font>

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Bruce Schneier article soon after</font>

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe he may have point it and</font>

925
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:29,190
he was upset understandably so because

already<font color="#CCCCCC"> long lines it at airports after</font>

927

rightfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> so is that this doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

934
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:47,070
a very effective control at what we're

00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:48,419
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop and that a determined</font>

936

attackers simply going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find other</font>

937
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:54,960
ways to get explosives on board and all

938
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:56,429
those were valid points but the

939
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,029
counterpoint to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's brought by a</font>

Bruce Sandman and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bruce doctor Sandman</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">managed or crisis communications field</font>

943
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:08,848
he's done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of research here and he</font>

944
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,589
actually takes the formula that we've

945
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:12,629
traditionally used for risk it and and

946
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:14,639
says that it's not complete so our

947
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:18,058
traditional formula is is that the

948
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,730
impact times the likelihood equals our

949
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:22,289
risk score and says well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

950
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,789
actually calculating there is the hazard

951
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:25,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the chances that something might</font>

952
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:27,799
happen is the chance that that that

953
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:30,089
terrorism attack actually comes through

954
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:32,489
but what it completely ignores is the

955
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:35,190
outrage level and so we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

956
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:36,779
how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country was in the wake of the</font>

957
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,668
shoe bombing attack and there were a lot

958
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:41,699
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very upset there was a lot of</font>

959
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:43,649
nervousness and the government was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

960
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,788
things about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but most of those things</font>

961
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">were behind the scenes their</font>

962
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:49,169
investigations<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are policy changes</font>

963
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,629
they're reorganizing our entire defense

964
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:54,210
industry and so as all that happened the

965
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:55,768
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were expressing concerns</font>

966
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,930
still had no comfort that anything was

967
00:34:55,768 --> 00:35:00,118
changing so the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> did something</font>

968
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:03,149
visible was it necessarily effective at

969
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,940
eliminating the threat probably not I

970
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,950
don't know but but certainly what it did

971
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,529
do is provide a visible mechanism to let

972
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,819
people know that we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

973
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:14,039
we're watching this we're trying to

974
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:16,319
protect you and it made people feel

975
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:19,859
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's value in that and so</font>

976
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:21,058
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that that when you're</font>

1004
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,119
that sometimes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to address</font>

1005
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,640
people's fear and outrage factors and so

1006
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,609
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a group we should be a</font>

1007
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,069
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit less derisive about security</font>

1008
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:31,140
theater and consider that it sometimes

1009
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:32,940
needed and hopefully not often certainly

1010
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,490
would all rather focus on the hazard or

1011
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather focus on reducing risk as we</font>

1012
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,598
traditionally see it but to completely

1013
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:44,009
ignore outrage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is a mistake that</font>

1014
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">we shouldn't make and so again the theme</font>

1015
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:47,700
through all this has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> words</font>

1016
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,250
matter that we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be professionals</font>

1017
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,680
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to consider the words</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1018
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,869
we use very carefully that we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1019
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">willing to question our beliefs and we</font>

1020
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:59,339
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider whether or not how</font>

1021
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,509
we're expressing ourselves is really a

1022
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:03,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">the message that we want</font>

1023
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:05,229
to get across and so whether it's

1024
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:06,880
referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yourself as a risk</font>

1025
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:09,129
professional instead of a security

1026
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,559
professional but as talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about cyber</font>

1027
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,630
espionage and so cyber war or just being

1028
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:15,069
less derisive when it comes to terms

1029
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,199
like security through obscurity or

1030
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:19,089
security theater and recognizing that

1031
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,789
those things really can provide benefit

1032
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:23,619
to your organization I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1033
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:25,380
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very careful about how we</font>

1034
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:27,339
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we communicate to people</font>

1035
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you very much for your</font>

1036
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:35,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">time really appreciated</font>

1037
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:35,539
