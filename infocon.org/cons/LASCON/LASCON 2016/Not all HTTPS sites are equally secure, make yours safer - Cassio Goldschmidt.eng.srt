00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:24,049
thanks so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> goodbye</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody and as</font>

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,939
you see here the James Bond picture this

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,280
is what a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past</font>

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,080
fought about HTTPS in other words

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,210
encryption in transit there was a

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,129
padlock in the web browser and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all bets</font>

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,650
were off right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's encrypted there's no</font>

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,080
way to actually bypass that but in the

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:42,230
last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years if you look at what</font>

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:46,790
happened since 2011 we have pretty much

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:50,809
a vulnerability related to ssl/tls<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS</font>

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:53,690
coming up we had breach we have crime we

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:57,500
had beast we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bar Mitzvah we had</font>

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,360
freak drowned heartbleed right all those

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,720
vulnerabilities were related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,509
ssl/tls and they were you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know given us</font>

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,979
all headaches because you know made us

19
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:09,110
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how do you implement the</font>

20
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,030
swing batter and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,220
cause for those vulnerabilities they

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,440
were related to encryption they were

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,080
related to padding they were related to

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,320
the initialization vector I buffer

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,899
overflow and they were not related to

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,059
anything later anything related to

27
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:31,220
encryption was really the implementation

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:33,920
of HTTPS or TLS if you will right so

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,229
what I'm going to talk here is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,350
couple of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do in order to</font>

31
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">make your HTTPS implementation a little</font>

32
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,369
bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more resilient</font>

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,959
we have only half an hour so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

34
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:49,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really talk just about a few things</font>

35
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:52,280
namely I'm going to talk about HT th st

36
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,050
s and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about painting</font>

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,110
in then I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit</font>

38
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,759
about first<font color="#CCCCCC"> part cookie which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a new</font>

39
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,130
setting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also use in your</font>

40
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,340
browser's they can help you making a

41
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,380
better system as well and some of the

42
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,190
tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're out here that can help you</font>

43
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,859
to troubleshoot and also analyze the

44
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,430
quality of your implementation of HTTPS

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,620
so without<font color="#CCCCCC"> further ado let's talk about</font>

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,580
HTTP strict Transport Security in other

47
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,970
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> age sts what is that well</font>

48
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,640
basically when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go in the type for</font>

49
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,160
example google com the first thing that

50
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the browser will try to do is go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> H</font>

51
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">BP google com and then it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

52
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,500
redirected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS and then you get</font>

53
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,510
encryption what that means basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

54
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,760
means that the attacker has the

55
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,670
opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a man-in-the-middle</font>

56
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,049
attack and put their<font color="#CCCCCC"> website sure the</font>

57
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,519
web browser will go and say hey it

58
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,170
doesn't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're going to google</font>

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,860
this looks like a fake site with a

60
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,380
self-signed certificate do you want to

61
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,140
go there how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> users would actually</font>

62
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,290
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually family percent of the users</font>

63
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,299
would look at that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yes I want to</font>

64
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,150
go to this website regardless of what

65
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,040
the browser is doing so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

66
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that we're putting this type of</font>

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,980
decision to the end user to do it and

68
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,620
there was no way for us the developers

69
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,109
to actually go and say no this is not

70
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,680
good you should not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

71
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:28,790
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's what AJ</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> STS does right</font>

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it takes away that opportunity for soft</font>

73
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,429
tail and do a hard fail whenever

74
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,440
something is not right<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the the</font>

75
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,220
website when there's a man in the middle

76
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:45,100
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know DNS trickery thing going on</font>

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:47,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and it also takes away this</font>

78
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,850
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the browser to first go</font>

79
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:53,840
HTTP and then HTTPS you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go</font>

80
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,730
https in the first run and we're going

81
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that in order to implement</font>

82
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,410
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple all you have to</font>

83
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,030
do is in your web application put a new

84
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,790
head which is strict Transport Security

85
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,850
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the Mac stage the tie</font>

86
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,230
you know the time period that this

87
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,420
setting is going to be valid for and

88
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,310
then you have other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

89
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,500
include<font color="#E5E5E5"> such as include sub domain or</font>

90
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,769
preload which we're going to talk about

91
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,980
in the next slide so when you're

92
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,840
implementing<font color="#CCCCCC"> HSPs the first thing that</font>

93
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,370
people might try is to implement this

94
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,020
with a self-signed certificate because

95
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,540
it can generate you don't have to pay

96
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">for anybody and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't work right</font>

97
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,270
you need a real certificate in order to

98
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,780
actually test this into your development

99
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">next you also cannot use IP or even a</font>

100
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,820
site is not encrypted obviously in order

101
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,940
to test a just<font color="#CCCCCC"> guests and the reason you</font>

102
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,040
cannot do with a sigh

103
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,110
is not encrypted is because it could be

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">used otherwise for a denial of service</font>

105
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,210
attack right in other words somebody

106
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,480
would inject this<font color="#CCCCCC"> header and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly</font>

107
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,890
your site would no longer be available

108
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,410
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it it will work for all</font>

109
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,450
ports and should you have any problems

110
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,450
ever what you do is if you want to

111
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:12,450
revoke the setting you do max<font color="#CCCCCC"> H equals</font>

112
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:14,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero exactly yeah so it's a very good</font>

113
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,710
point you are protecting the client you

114
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,220
telling the client don't do anything

115
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">stupid don't go actually and you know</font>

116
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,850
bypass the browser telling you hate this

117
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,130
is not a good sight you're probably

118
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fished right and that's what</font>

119
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,580
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

120
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:35,219
directive called include include

121
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,680
subdomains right what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does directory the</font>

122
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,990
directive does is every single sub

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,540
domain out there in your website would

124
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,120
be included<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this setting as well</font>

125
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,680
this doesn't mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every single</font>

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,110
sub domain you shouldn't but this header

127
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually should because a lot of</font>

128
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,580
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to your website throw</font>

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,740
different you know ways and you should

130
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this directive in every single</font>

131
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">website out there geography to be a</font>

132
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,750
concern is about ntp in other words the

133
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,860
network time protocol if somebody

134
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,710
actually has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to mess up with</font>

135
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:17,580
ntp interio hey you wore six months in

136
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:19,979
the future then this directive will

137
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,320
expire and then the full behavior we're

138
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:26,940
kicking in other words it will try again

139
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,760
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS so there's</font>

140
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,500
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> this first time use case that we</font>

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,260
have to solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going to look at</font>

142
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,840
the next slide right you still should

143
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,909
use secure cookies because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacker</font>

144
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,250
could go and if you don't protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

145
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,919
single sub domain make up a sub domain

146
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:48,230
there is not https and then get your

147
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">cookies so let's look at the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font>

148
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,240
prevent the you know first used scenario

149
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,760
from being exploited so what you do is

150
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
you preload your website into the

151
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,190
browser the way you

152
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,849
that is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to this site</font>

153
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:06,610
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a HS TS preload eps pot calm</font>

154
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:09,009
and then you put your website and then

155
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,020
it will preload in all major browsers a

156
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:13,300
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this and say wow</font>

157
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,460
how is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scare</font>

158
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">right if everyone's going to use what's</font>

159
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,448
going to be the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this list well</font>

160
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,660
not our problem but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it's</font>

161
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:25,259
you know being done right now it will

162
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:29,590
work for Chrome Safari you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I EA</font>

163
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,270
ie11 edge Firefox everybody and there's

164
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,780
a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do one</font>

165
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,750
is you have to use the directive preload

166
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:41,590
you need to have at a minimum of 18

167
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:43,569
weeks exploration in your HS TS and

168
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,780
that's pretty much what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to do</font>

169
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:49,229
in order to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it very easy setting to</font>

170
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,400
use in highly recommended because really

171
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:54,610
seventy percent of the users are

172
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,340
actually bypassing that warning message

173
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,169
that you see in the browser the next

174
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,049
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to talk about is spinning</font>

175
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:04,299
and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time looking</font>

176
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,520
at how public key infrastructure works

177
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,650
in order to understand what pinning does

178
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,479
and what's the problem it's trying to

179
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,039
solve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

180
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,860
understand is that there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> several</font>

181
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,740
different certificate authorities out

182
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,080
there right in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> drawing here you see</font>

183
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,000
a certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> or is being represented by</font>

184
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">this you know blue certificate authority</font>

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,909
green certificate authority red purple

186
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:30,159
and so on there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a hundred</font>

187
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:32,140
certificate authorities out there in

188
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,208
what they do for you is once you claim

189
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,130
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a domain they will verify</font>

190
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,140
that depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font>

191
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,120
certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> II you have getting if</font>

192
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,880
you're just getting a regular

193
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,229
certificate or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a extended validate</font>

194
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,839
validation certificate you might have

195
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,089
more validation going on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

196
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,550
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate authority will do</font>

197
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,589
is validate you are who you claim to be

198
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,449
in then provide your certificate that

199
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:57,880
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually sign in other words they</font>

200
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,820
vouch for you that you are who you say

201
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,649
you are in this case everybody here all

202
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,149
those servers requested the blue

203
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,670
certificate authority to<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates a</font>

204
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,820
certificate they were distributed and

205
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,750
this guy here with the Bighorns is evil

206
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,520
and he is

207
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,990
hey I'm google and the certificate toy

208
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,790
was saying hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not a Google</font>

209
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,830
you're a fish<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside I'm not going to</font>

210
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you a certificate for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google right</font>

211
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,370
so the only thing that this guy can do

212
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,800
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a self-signed</font>

213
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,470
certificate right which I'm represented

214
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,020
with another color yellow here and say I

215
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,300
am google says i right that's pretty

216
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,579
much what that certificate is saying so

217
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,670
when you have a client such as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

218
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,130
app that wants to go to a website here's

219
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,110
what happens it goes to the website and

220
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,510
gets a copy of the certificate in

221
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,400
compares with the certificates validates

222
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,480
against the certificate store which is

223
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that mobile mobile device and will</font>

224
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,700
say well this certificate was vouched by

225
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,860
the blue certificate authority so it

226
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:02,120
must be valid because it was validated

227
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:04,850
by those guys on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand if this</font>

228
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,950
mobile app goes to that rogue site it

229
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,540
looks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that self-signed certificate</font>

230
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,970
will it will look<font color="#E5E5E5"> against the</font>

231
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:14,990
certificate store and say well death

232
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:17,510
certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not vouched by</font>

233
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,450
anybody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I trust so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

234
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,370
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big warning message you know and you</font>

235
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,670
know right things in red and broken

236
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,320
padlock and so on to show you that that

237
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,650
certificate is not something you should

238
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">be trusting right the problem here is</font>

239
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,270
that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only the</font>

240
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,860
blue certificate authority in other

241
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,930
words the certificate toy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

242
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,230
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is the one that can</font>

243
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually create certificates for you in</font>

244
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,820
unfortunately this is not the truth what

245
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,890
happens is any certificate authority can

246
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,350
go and create a certificate on your

247
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,910
behalf without your knowledge and that's

248
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:57,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">very important what I'm saying here is</font>

249
00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:00,380
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red certificate authority I</font>

250
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,230
you know starts working with a foreign

251
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">nation or is breached or you know</font>

252
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,280
decides to go rogue they could say well

253
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,030
now I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a certificate for a</font>

254
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,699
certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> for google com and because</font>

255
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,740
they are a trusted a certificate

256
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">authority we fail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know certificate</font>

257
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,600
II in the certificate store people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

258
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,939
actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate as</font>

259
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,699
valid in other words if you go to that

260
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">website now and it will validate against</font>

261
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:29,868
the certificate store will say well yeah

262
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:32,269
it's a certificate for us to keep

263
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:34,669
certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> or deed a trust so it's</font>

264
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:36,619
vouched so it's a big problem especially

265
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:39,309
for companies there you know big less

266
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:39,309
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

267
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,910
how much yeah yeah and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

268
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,290
kind of attacks really happened right

269
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,180
pinning was something that came from

270
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,189
from google Wendy who actually seen

271
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,459
foreign nations going increase

272
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:07,290
certificate for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail and people were</font>

273
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:10,170
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see all the communication that</font>

274
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:12,959
was going with Gmail so how to solve

275
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,060
this that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinning comes in so</font>

276
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,508
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pini does and here's an</font>

277
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,910
example of tourists on first use is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

278
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:23,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile application would still go to</font>

279
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,410
the website get a certificate validate

280
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,630
against the certificate store see there

281
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,269
is valid and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the certificate is</font>

282
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,630
valid the next time that it actually

283
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:36,690
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the website the certificate was</font>

284
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,880
it spin would make the certificate store

285
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,199
go out of the picture in other words you

286
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate store</font>

287
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,269
anymore you just use that certificate

288
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,009
you got as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reference so when you go</font>

289
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,839
to the website again it will just

290
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:51,680
compare those two certificates say are

291
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,029
they the same or is the certificate

292
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,760
created by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the certificate authority</font>

293
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:59,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I trust right so I don't trust the</font>

green<font color="#CCCCCC"> the purple the red certificate or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">e</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I only trust the blue now so the scope</font>

296
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:09,750
of the attack surface is drastically

297
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,839
reduced by this kind of by this kind of

298
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,370
technique right now if you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

299
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,040
that attack they just showed you that

300
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,959
actually worked and the evil certificate

301
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,439
Tory creates a red certificate authority

302
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,569
I mean a red certificate and you know

303
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,940
the mobile application<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets that</font>

304
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:28,800
certificate when it compares it will say

305
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,420
well it was not created by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue</font>

306
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,550
certificate authority it doesn't look

307
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate or a pain so i'm</font>

308
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,870
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trust so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really reduce</font>

309
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:39,149
the attack surface right and for

310
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,850
companies such as you know Google's and

311
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,920
Facebook's in banks this is very

312
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,079
interesting and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

313
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,079
actively implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

314
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">things the problem is that implementing</font>

315
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:56,939
this is really a pain in the butt I

316
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:59,790
actually work for a organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

317
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:03,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">managed over 600 banks so we had over</font>

318
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,980
600 certificates<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were managing</font>

319
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,600
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to implement is it make</font>

320
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,670
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't shoot ourselves in</font>

321
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,670
the foot what we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is work with</font>

322
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,020
two certificates right so one from one

323
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,870
certificate authority ensure this

324
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,010
certificate authority be breached we

325
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,930
want another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one from another</font>

326
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,040
certificate authority and we want to

327
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,410
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that those certificates</font>

328
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,969
actually have don't expire at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

329
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,069
time and they have some overlapping

330
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:30,360
between the times that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually are</font>

331
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:31,950
expiring right so suddenly the Ops guys

332
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,450
we're looking at me you know the

333
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,280
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy and they will say you're</font>

334
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:38,880
crazy now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from 600</font>

335
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,650
certificate to a 1200 certificate that

336
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,140
we have to renew when we have to manage

337
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what if something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goes wrong casio</font>

338
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,150
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be out of business right</font>

339
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:53,010
because basically this will block the

340
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:56,160
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our with our service</font>

341
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,530
so it's very very risky right although

342
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,689
it's a great idea in paper a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

343
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are not implement in fact I you</font>

344
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,750
know had a lot of fun meetings with my

345
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:11,010
staff and at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to</font>

346
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:13,800
implement this in a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way if you</font>

347
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,840
want to implement this in a web browser

348
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,400
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit simply you don't have</font>

349
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,890
to code things that you would do in a

350
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,170
mobile device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have this header</font>

351
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can be used public key pins and</font>

352
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,209
then it's really similar to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HS TS</font>

353
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,920
header you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a max age and then you</font>

354
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,260
have the certificate that you want to

355
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">pin right you have the short 256 of</font>

356
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,510
those certificates and you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

357
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,790
meantime<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was to discussing with my</font>

358
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,100
developers in my team how we're going to

359
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:45,209
implement this until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually read</font>

360
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,520
the entire RFC for the HTTP version of

361
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Penny and I found this thing which is</font>

362
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the public keeping report only which is</font>

363
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,500
a directive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they tell you to use</font>

364
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,390
when you're still implementing and

365
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,280
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you did fix right and</font>

366
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,699
you're still testing you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

367
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,380
report and have a soft fail at some

368
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,230
point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to my developers and they</font>

369
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,450
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey let's implement this just as</font>

370
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,970
report only because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

371
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,310
certificates we don't need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

372
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,690
management that I told you before right

373
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,660
in a still have a

374
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:24,370
notification when things don't go right

375
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:26,620
so it's a way to implement they you

376
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have any risk and still have the</font>

377
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,820
information and when it I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

378
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,980
the development<font color="#CCCCCC"> team they were like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

379
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,780
you know one week<font color="#E5E5E5"> after they said yeah</font>

380
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,240
let's implement this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy I</font>

381
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:40,390
will just get you the reports using JSON

382
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,390
to a website and should anybody you know

383
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,939
ever create a rogue certificate on our

384
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:48,670
behalf we will know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the</font>

385
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,100
report so I found to be a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

386
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:54,339
way to implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> things then actually</font>

387
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:57,970
going and trying to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the way and</font>

388
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,670
have the risk of a catastrophic failure

389
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,360
in our website in all fingers playing to

390
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:08,139
security the next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font>

391
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:13,659
is not really related to https however

392
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:16,900
in the past we've seen a lot of exploit

393
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,670
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS there would rely either on</font>

394
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,160
cross-site scripting or cross-site

395
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:24,250
request forgery so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

396
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,900
very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and it's a very new</font>

397
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,180
setting that people should be aware of

398
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,830
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first party cookie</font>

399
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,040
it came out this year a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

400
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:34,720
ago when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I proposed this talk it was in</font>

401
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,970
beta and I said the album I'm still

402
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,280
going to talk it about it at last con

403
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,920
and now it's already deployed in in

404
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,899
chrome<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use so</font>

405
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,570
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part cookie and what's</font>

406
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,400
the third party cookie a first-party

407
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,919
cookie is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cookie that comes from</font>

408
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,540
your website<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you are in so for</font>

409
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">example let's say you are in this</font>

410
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">website which is harmonica lava</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fear</font>

411
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,930
right and then you have a picture they

412
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,880
request it to that website whenever you

413
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,070
request that picture the cook you will

414
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,860
be sent and CC to the same site where

415
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,169
you are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a first-party cookie now</font>

416
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,510
let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the light widget from</font>

417
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,700
facebook that widget is stored on

418
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,510
facebook should you be logged on

419
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,540
facebook it will actually request the

420
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,280
widget and will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also provide your cookie</font>

421
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,590
for facebook and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook</font>

422
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,840
knows that you're visiting for example

423
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,439
the harmonica website next time you go

424
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,990
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook it will all be offering</font>

425
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,340
you harmonicas and fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that right</font>

426
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:39,679
so the privacy people already<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

427
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,600
this out input settings in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser</font>

428
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,289
in order to prevent this from happening

429
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,480
so it was a privacy thing until now now

430
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:49,908
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> people look at that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it said hey</font>

431
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,750
there's a way that this can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

432
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to make better security as well</font>

433
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:58,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider for example cross-site request</font>

434
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,850
forgery pretty much it's a third party

435
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:04,759
website that is going to have a request

436
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,908
to your website ensure the person be log

437
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:10,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">in to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website then this request is</font>

438
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:12,889
going to work what you do is you put

439
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,590
this directive which is same site equals

440
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:17,990
strict and then whenever a third party

441
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:21,110
site makes a request to your website it

442
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:27,080
won't send the cookies anymore there are

443
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:29,809
three flavors of the same site setting

444
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,080
one is normal so it would work as it

445
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,820
works today one is strict so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's strict</font>

446
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,559
pretty much would prevent cookies from

447
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,230
going whenever you have this type of

448
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,830
requests and then you have lacks right

449
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:47,419
in lex is also very useful because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

450
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:49,309
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you if you use the strict</font>

451
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,590
setting you're going to have some

452
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,809
problems with compatibility or making

453
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,730
your website work if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> lakhs</font>

454
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,408
chances are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your site</font>

455
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,960
work and not break any functionality

456
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,059
right for example link on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font>

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">page that points to your website would</font>

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:08,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">still work so very a nice concession</font>

459
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,710
that was made with same site was to use

460
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:15,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">lakhs and not just strict and you know</font>

461
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:20,330
try to to be you know completely secure

462
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:22,219
and draconian there so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last part of</font>

463
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,019
this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font>

464
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,700
tools they are considered to be quite

465
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:30,889
useful whenever you do in your HTTPS TLS

466
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,620
implementation from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the ground</font>

467
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:36,529
up or when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just want to analyze it</font>

468
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:39,110
see if you're doing a good job<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

469
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:41,090
affiliated with any of those companies I

470
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,279
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a professional endorsement</font>

471
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,269
however I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think some of those things are</font>

472
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,179
free and they're pretty

473
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:49,789
cool the first one I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

474
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:53,179
is called let's encrypt what let's

475
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:57,408
encrypt does is it creates the automated

476
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:59,299
way to issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we knew</font>

477
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:02,330
certificates it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does for free</font>

478
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:04,609
basically you get a agent<font color="#E5E5E5"> install in</font>

479
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:08,839
your web server and then it will

480
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:11,958
actually do all the authentication of

481
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:14,119
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS automatically and will we issue</font>

482
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:16,009
a certificate for you and it's pretty

483
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:19,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hassle free you need like two lines</font>

484
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:21,950
of you know command lines in order to

485
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:24,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this happening so very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy</font>

486
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a certificate in</font>

487
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,429
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> website in certificates are really</font>

488
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:31,039
something that people should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

489
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:33,169
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single website these days for</font>

490
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,729
example Google will get you a better

HTTPS iOS said that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

starting next year service pages on

496
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:58,369
browsers are actually only work if you

497
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:01,218
use HTTPS so a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

498
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:03,320
becoming HTTPS only and that's where the

00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:05,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is going so you should be</font>

500
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,649
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using and this is a good way</font>

501
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:11,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use to be quite frank the first use</font>

502
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:13,820
case that we had for this as a

503
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:16,429
consulting company was to do fishing

504
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,649
campaigns and the reason was because we

505
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:20,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">have requests from different customers</font>

506
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:23,629
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to create our domain idiot our</font>

507
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:25,389
actually lower our costs in order to get

508
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:29,059
the certificates because it's free and

509
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:31,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">also dominated our process right so if</font>

510
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:34,039
we were a legit<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a legitimate</font>

511
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,649
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> or looking at this to do fishing</font>

512
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:39,259
imagine the bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is a</font>

513
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:40,758
godsend for them so you see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

514
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:43,789
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys actually looking at let's</font>

515
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,729
encrypt which is a nice thing being used

516
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:51,079
for you know evil or malicious purpose

517
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:52,609
as well the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> site it has some</font>

518
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,369
really cool features is called

519
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:58,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">cloudflare cloudflare started out</font>

520
00:22:55,369 --> 00:23:01,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing CDN and what they do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is they</font>

521
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,710
a taking ownership of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and then</font>

522
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,870
the proxy all the communication to your

523
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,030
website and one thing they can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

524
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,879
you is they can provide your certificate

525
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,678
and certificate management for free so

526
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,630
in other words they you go to their

527
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:19,520
website you give your<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

528
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:23,419
do you want to have HTTPS here and you

529
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,240
say yes and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two ways that</font>

530
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:28,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can provide HTTPS for you one is</font>

531
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,799
the flexible in other words the visitor

532
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,539
would go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare and this</font>

533
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,010
communication would be encrypted however

534
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:36,530
the communication from cloud player

535
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,419
which is your proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your server would</font>

536
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,730
be unencrypted so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user would see</font>

537
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:42,919
everything encrypted would protect his

538
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,559
data in that part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communication</font>

539
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,799
but not in this part nice thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

540
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:51,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">cloudflare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Flair has a lot of experts on</font>

541
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,418
TLS and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are always looking at all</font>

542
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,250
the latest attacks and they will manage

543
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:57,890
all the ciphers for you and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

544
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:01,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're safe your site secure the</font>

545
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,080
next type of offering they have is

546
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,658
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use a self-signed</font>

547
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,178
certificate and make the encryption all

548
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:10,220
the way from<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know end-to-end or use</font>

549
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:12,440
a certificate generated by a certificate

550
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,620
authority in have this encryption all

551
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,049
the way as well so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the three</font>

552
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:22,699
ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudflare can actually offer</font>

553
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:25,870
free you know certificates for you and

554
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:29,480
do all the management next we have

<font color="#CCCCCC">Google Chrome which has a debugging to</font>

embedded in the browser that came around

557
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,110
februari<font color="#CCCCCC"> March this year so we will tell</font>

558
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you what kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of encryption is being</font>

559
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,820
used with the browser right and what

560
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,549
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protocol in a lot of really good</font>

561
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:47,000
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have another really</font>

562
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:51,139
excellent tool which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the ssl labs</font>

563
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">too and this to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually point to a</font>

564
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,760
https site and will tell you whether you

567
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,789
many others that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out it will tell</font>

568
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how your website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will work with</font>

different browsers or different mobile

570
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,059
devices or whether it will work at all

571
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,990
with the configuration you have it will

572
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,570
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you a</font>

573
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,520
rate for your implementation so it goes

574
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:20,090
from like f which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> say your encryption</font>

575
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,620
is completely fraud to a a plus the way
