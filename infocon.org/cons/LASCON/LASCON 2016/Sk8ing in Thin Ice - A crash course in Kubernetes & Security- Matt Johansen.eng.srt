00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,490
so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> apparently the schedule didn't</font>

3
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,990
say what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking about so thanks</font>

4
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,029
for coming literally just for my name

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,479
that's kind of weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,820
so this this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I gave I gave</font>

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,050
this at a DevOps days<font color="#E5E5E5"> Austin very</font>

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,690
similar talk it's a little bit updated

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,550
but James wicket who's the organizer

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,620
here thought that it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good to</font>

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,510
kind of give a more developer defense

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,330
type focus talk out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,470
conference usually if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last come before I've spoken here</font>

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,530
the past couple years and usually it's

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,269
very like here's I'm how I'm gonna break

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,530
everything and then just walk out and

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,360
not tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how to solve it this is</font>

19
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,490
kind of a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit different you know</font>

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,010
some how I broke everything and how to

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,770
solve it just by a show of hands I know

22
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,680
my audience who here has heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> uber</font>

23
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nettie's okay who here has used Cuban at</font>

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,450
ease always always a smaller number cool

25
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,210
that that's that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give just a quick</font>

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,350
overview of Coober Nettie's for for a

28
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,550
bit maybe talk a little bit about some

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,149
containerization then we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

30
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">some security pitfalls and some benefits</font>

31
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:25,160
and you know how to avoid some of them

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,569
all right first of all the thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

you at least recognize it but which is

43
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,330
just still super strange to me but yeah

44
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,740
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done this done the security thing</font>

45
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,770
once or twice I head up security for

46
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,958
honest dollar and yeah we'll go from

47
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,770

is this we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of talk</font>

49
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a little bit I have no idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm</font>

50
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:03,860
pronouncing it right so please don't ask

51
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,390

52
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,959
or something like that but I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cooper</font>

53
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nettie's i really like i always like</font>

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,959
asking that question early on and see

55
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,730
how many hands go down who's actually

56
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,069
used it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to me</font>

57
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,049
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all second of all the why to</font>

58
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,940
use it is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting like</font>

59
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,910
okay well why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you using communities</font>

60
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,859
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully the answer is not because</font>

61
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,510
like Netflix does it or something like

62
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,400
that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully there's like some</font>

63
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,230
benefit in your mind to doing like a

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,230
micro service architecture

65
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,359
so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about that</font>

66
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,390
security pitfalls basically we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">to we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna hit on some things where</font>

68
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,738
if you follow the documentation to the

69
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,769
letter on communities you wind up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

70
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:47,360
pretty insecure architecture at least up

71
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,500
to my standards and so this was

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,230
something that I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

73
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,849
with walking into an organization using

74
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,640
this and having never really played with

75
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:57,440
it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there is a lot of benefits</font>

76
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,578
also so just right out of the box

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,170
there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of stuff and we'll</font>

78
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,209
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that and I promise no live</font>

79
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,089
demos I didn't sacrifice the requisite

80
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,680
goat and so that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably fail</font>

81
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,540
anyway so we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just we'll just talk</font>

82
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,519
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some examples without without any</font>

83
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,959
demos so for those of you who didn't

84
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,540
raise your hand early on about you don't

85
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,540
know what goober news is really quickly

86
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,578
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a just to sum it up it's</font>

87
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,560
a container<font color="#CCCCCC"> containerisation</font>

88
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:23,840
orchestration tool right so if you want

89
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use docker containers that's great</font>

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
docker containers are fun but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

91
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,920
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use them in kind of an</font>

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,160
enterprise microservice architecture

93
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,988
full stack type of deal having something

94
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,760
to orchestrate all of them where they

95
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,829
spin up when they spin up how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of</font>

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,750
them spin up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole life cycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

97
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,280
container<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooper Nettie's is kind of the</font>

98
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,859
leading tool for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now there</font>

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,150
was some competitors that have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

100
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,510
fizzled this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that's</font>

101
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,030
sticking around the other key thing know

102
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,798
about it is if just also<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious how</font>

103
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people have used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Cloud like</font>

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,250
instead of AWS like Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font>

105
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:01,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">services not that many of you okay so</font>

106
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,069
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an AWS competitor type</font>

107
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,959
thing and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the options is just</font>

108
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,458
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cooper Nettie's right out of the box so</font>

109
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,290
if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called google</font>

110
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,489
container engine and if you're using

111
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're using communities whether</font>

112
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,389
you knew it or not you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew it</font>

113
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,310
if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it okay so what does</font>

114
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,228
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like right so goober</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nerys</font>

115
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,849
there's a there's this concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

116
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">master node i'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go too deep</font>

117
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:23,539
into this but this is concept of a

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,810
master that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give instructions</font>

119
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:28,099
to a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different nodes you're</font>

120
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,419
gonna hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> me say a bunch of words I</font>

121
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:33,260
promise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll explain what they all mean</font>

122
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:35,479
soon but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just there's</font>

123
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">this overlay network that you kind of</font>

124
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,539
have to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and then this master</font>

125
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,190
is going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to distribute</font>

126
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:41,770
containers across all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes</font>

127
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,509
tell them what to do

128
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,039
tell them everything this slide is more

129
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:48,280
here for reference i'm not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

130
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,110
to too deep into into this but you know

131
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,299
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pulling pulling docker images</font>

132
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,819
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> soaring them out and doing all sorts</font>

133
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,639
of cool stuff so one of the hardest

134
00:04:54,819 --> 00:05:00,159
things for me in terms of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font>

135
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,470
curve coming up to speed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cuba</font>

136
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:04,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nettie's when i first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started at this</font>

137
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,849
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> and had no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know some security guy who didn't</font>

139
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:11,650
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough about the new cool hot tech</font>

140
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,780
was the words being used right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,310
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my developers and they said</font>

142
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,349
oh well we're gonna do this with this

143
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,849
pod this reputation controller and ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

144
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just said you got to slow down i don't</font>

145
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:23,050
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what words you're saying right</font>

146
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,030
so just a quick definition of some

147
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you're going to hear me say and</font>

148
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,599
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free to shout at me if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I start</font>

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,948
saying stuff that you don't know what

150
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:32,500
means later on because I'm starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

151
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:34,509
take it for granted so when I say no do

152
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,919
you hear vm<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Coober Nettie's land it's</font>

153
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:38,650
like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vm that a bunch of</font>

154
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,240
containers are on a pod is just a group

155
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,460
of containers right so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,080
you're you're in a micro service

157
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,180
architecture you might have a group of

158
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,310
containers that do one singular task

159
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,620
right so you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication</font>

160
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,440
service that's going to be some

161
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,909
container that does token handling some

162
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
that does logging some that does

163
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else and okay these three</font>

164
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,969
containers are the authentication

165
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:04,210
service they make up a pod replication

166
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:06,610
controllers these are and services these

167
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,620
are the set of yamel files since y<font color="#CCCCCC"> se</font>

168
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">llaman lend you kind of have to get used</font>

169
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,360
to a bunch of gamma files if you're

170
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,590
going to play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cuban eighties</font>

171
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,900
application controllers and services are

172
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,210
basically the configuration files of how

173
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,409
to spin all of them up and down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

174
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,229
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do with them and</font>

175
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,969
a clusters is is a network you're going

176
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a its own kubernetes</font>

177
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:32,830
cluster is its own network it's it's own

178
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:35,229
group of nodes right so like I said the

179
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,818
<font color="#E5E5E5">yamo stuff is super important if you're</font>

180
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,590
gonna if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start playing</font>

182
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,909
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up these these</font>

184
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll bring up some some examples of that</font>

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,240
later some different environments some

186
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,460
some persistence these these things all

187
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,849
kind of you know should be obvious to

188
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,308
you guys and

189
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:57,050
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one quote right so the</font>

190
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:58,749
secret sauce this quotes from one of my

191
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,309
infrastructure architects and he goes

192
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:02,479
docker is not actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the secret</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sauce</font>

193
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:04,610
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that magic we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

194
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">care what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> containerization tools we're</font>

195
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,389
using a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people say doctor this</font>

196
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,429
doctor that and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 99 percent of the</font>

197
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,080
containerization market but you can you

198
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,239
can sub in whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> containerization</font>

199
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,279
technology you want and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

200
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
orchestration is what allows you to do

201
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,499
some reap the benefits of using this

202
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,889
technology anyway right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so learning</font>

203
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:26,689
this stuff is super important let's talk

204
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">about pitfalls so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I said if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you if</font>

205
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:30,559
you follow the documentation you're

206
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:32,689
gonna you're gonna and which most people

207
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,459
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> right obviously that's why it's</font>

208
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:37,189
there you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find yourself into</font>

209
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:40,399
some issues so one of them is they've

210
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:42,619
got this concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> namespaces that they</font>

211
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,289
you know they try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to set up</font>

212
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:47,149
which says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay namespace is dev or QA</font>

213
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,729
or prod or whatever it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it all</font>

214
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:50,869
sits on one cluster so as a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

215
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,789
when I came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at this</font>

216
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:54,289
infrastructure I say do you mean that

217
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,699
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff is on the same network</font>

218
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:59,479
and they can all talk to talk to each

219
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:01,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">other so our production data is on the</font>

220
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,589
same network as our dev<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment and</font>

221
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,240
as our QA test code that hasn't been

222
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:08,089
reviewed and such and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth</font>

223
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,069
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer is basically yes right so</font>

224
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,019
if you go down this namespace road this

225
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">is kind of the first pitfall that you</font>

226
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:17,779
run into and this is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they teach you</font>

227
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,949
to set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up right so this is what it</font>

228
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,719
looks like right I've mentioned the

229
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,759
animal files a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times so this is a</font>

230
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:25,219
what is it a service or replication

231
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,889
control or one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

232
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:29,419
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the definition of all your</font>

233
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:32,630
different namespaces right so it says

234
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:35,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool I got dev I got QA I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got prod</font>

235
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,909
and just spin them all up in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

236
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,968
same area<font color="#E5E5E5"> please the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you end</font>

237
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,620
up with if you go down this path is a

238
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,579
lot of depth the duplication of work

239
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,170
because if you're if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

240
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:49,160
you know all this in one cluster you're

241
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,509
going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these different</font>

242
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,670
yamla files that look almost identical

243
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,470
and the version control gets really

244
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,479
nasty and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really error-prone right</font>

245
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,250
again following<font color="#E5E5E5"> the documentation this</font>

246
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,110
is what you end up with

247
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,180
and and it gets really hairy really

248
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,030
quickly and it's super error-prone and

249
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,530
you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a network of everything</font>

250
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,060
that lives on them that's why I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

251
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,780
cluster that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one cluster to rule them</font>

252
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,030
all kind of thing right so you know this

253
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:19,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this is just not the way to go a</font>

254
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:20,689
really easy fix on this I have an update

255
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,760
here also but a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy fix on this</font>

256
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,500
is to just do separate clusters right

257
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,020
criminy's left you mixed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> or clusters</font>

258
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,760
so why wouldn't we do that you can this

259
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,230
this effectively makes them completely

260
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,910
different network spaces and if

261
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,620
different IP spaces they don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

262
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,790
about each other unless you specifically

263
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,910
tell them that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to each</font>

264
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:41,569
other in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most recent version of</font>

265
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cuban a days 14 I think there's a</font>

266
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,320
there's a concept of subnets which is

267
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,970
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative to this you can</font>

268
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,220
still segregate the network's that's a

269
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,510
very new feature so I don't know too

270
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,550
much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but it's kind of</font>

271
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,860
effectively reaches the same solves the

272
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,719
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in somewhat of a cleaner</font>

273
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,110
way instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having to create VPNs</font>

274
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">between all these networks right back to</font>

275
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,400
the duplication of work if you have all

276
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those llamo files that are all just</font>

277
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,750
going to be saying the same thing over

278
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,859
and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you know that</font>

279
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,630
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> really messy so one of the ways</font>

288
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,660
because now I know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

289
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">one change in one place I know exactly</font>

290
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you changed I know where it ended</font>

291
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,570
up and I know what environment it's

292
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,890
running in right so this is this little

293
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,420
screen shot from one of my developers

294
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,180
when I asked him for some content for

295
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,829
this he had to comment out drink beer

296
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,479
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some reason but yeah so basically</font>

297
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,040
just in one command and as little

298
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,990
commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible set up your entire</font>

299
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,370
environment also very recently as in

300
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,720
past couple months there's now a tool

301
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,850
called helm if you're really interested

302
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,250
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you should write that down helm</font>

303
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,400
will stand up your will do a lot of this

304
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,530
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you in in a puppet in chef Esk</font>

305
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,410
way but a little bit more container

306
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,540
friendly right

307
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,089
so again this is going to allow you to

308
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">track all of your versions you know what</font>

309
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:18,250
codes running where this is going to

310
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:19,930
allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really reduce errors and</font>

311
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,009
again it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not following the</font>

312
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,680
documentation you kind of have to

313
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:24,790
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what you're doing is you</font>

314
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,949
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a little bit more</font>

315
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,879
right the dependencies are another big

316
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:29,258
one right if you're going to be

317
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,779
duplicating all these dependencies

318
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:33,220
everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm guessing everyone in the</font>

319
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,449
room is kind of played with docker at

320
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,819
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of you who have played with</font>

321
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:37,779
docker right one of the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

322
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:40,029
things that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of gloss</font>

323
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:41,560
over and docker files is the base image

324
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,129
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you start worrying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

325
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">what why we're using Ubuntu for this</font>

326
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,920
thing that does this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> little thing so</font>

327
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,469
there's you know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff</font>

328
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,149
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are using Alpine now I</font>

329
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if you guys heard that it's</font>

330
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,509
like a purposely small linux and you

331
00:11:54,129 --> 00:12:01,420
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> worrying about dependencies a lot</font>

332
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:03,370
less right all right one this is kind of

333
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,860
this was my bane of my existence for a

334
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,629
long time here right so again following

335
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,370
following the docs this is what you end

336
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:12,970
up with if you're going to use engine X

337
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:16,269
as a you know reverse proxy or web

338
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:18,519
server in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cooper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nettie's cluster</font>

339
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can make it a type load balancer</font>

340
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,850
which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it'll spin up it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

341
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,060
really neat stuff right it'll spin up a

342
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,889
bunch of engine X containers for you and

343
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,209
do all sorts of really neat load

344
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,029
balancing things right out of the box

345
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:33,910
but what this actually does is it

346
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:35,860
changes it from HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic to network</font>

347
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,839
traffic as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it hits the cluster</font>

348
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,759
which means you lose all source

349
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,040
information you have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea where this</font>

350
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,279
request came from from an HTTP like

351
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,170
weblog you know format you're going to

352
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at your logs and and it's all going</font>

353
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be 10 dot like internal IP addresses</font>

354
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,380
right and so I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> on board I was like</font>

355
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,630
hey why is Oliver what's going on all I

356
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,569
keV web requests we've ever got is

357
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,309
internal what's going on and this is the

358
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,870
reason again straight out of the

359
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:04,959
documentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I didn't I think I</font>

360
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,309
took this picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> docks I don't</font>

361
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,979
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took this picture from something</font>

362
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:10,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">I typed up so the header information is</font>

363
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,699
gone is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it turns from</font>

364
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:15,550
HTTP to network traffic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you lose</font>

365
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:17,979
HTTP headers information in your locks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

366
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,149
I went on to the communities github it's

367
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,720
an open source project went on to the

368
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:22,310
github open an issue and

369
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,139
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community's guys said well</font>

370
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how cloud networking works so</font>

371
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,639
unless you change cloud networking you

372
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,050
can't change this so there's a bunch of

373
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,939
security guys on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comment chain</font>

374
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:37,219
saying what like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that being</font>

375
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:39,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">certain thing but but okay right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

376
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">did introduce a concept of an ingress</font>

377
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,439
controller and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can kind of set</font>

378
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,660
this ingress controller up as this as

379
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:47,329
the way to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your kubernetes</font>

380
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,740
cluster I spent an embarrassingly long

381
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,849
time trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to work if</font>

382
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,269
someone knows how to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to work</font>

383
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,920
let's chat afterwards but basically that

384
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:57,170
along with some other things the

385
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,599
solution really<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for us was pull</font>

386
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,399
engine X<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of communities just put</font>

387
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,769
engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> X on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ravi em and then that's</font>

388
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,810
the Gateway for HTTP traffic and then

389
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,339
you get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your you still preserve all</font>

390
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,229
your information and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

391
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,759
pass it along there's definitely other

392
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,470
solutions that was just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easy</font>

393
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,810
ones and then it also makes all sorts of

394
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">other plug-in stuff available so just</font>

395
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,689
because you can container eyes it and

396
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,420
use it incriminates doesn't mean you

397
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,980
should all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time necessarily a lot of</font>

398
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,449
technologies haven't really caught up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

399
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,089
the fact that people are sticking it in

400
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:27,949
containers and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that way a lot</font>

401
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:31,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like integrations are all of a sudden</font>

402
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:35,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">go away this one was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really tricky but</font>

403
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:38,240
you know we pulled it out this is my

404
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,370
other this is my other funny one so when

405
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">when again I got hired and I came in and</font>

406
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,790
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the environment I</font>

407
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:45,579
said okay I'm gonna do what any security

408
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,860
person would do and sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and</font>

409
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:50,809
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wall off the environments and</font>

410
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,290
like try to control traffic in and out

411
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:57,170
and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> no limit sources and and and</font>

412
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,790
all sorts of stuff try to limit kind of

413
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,250
attack surface right basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what</font>

414
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,399
i'm getting at so i created this whole

415
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,779
bastion jump<font color="#CCCCCC"> post situation for ssh all</font>

416
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,040
a state traffic if you wanted to get

417
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,620
into the communities cluster had to go

418
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,709
through this one box spent like you know

419
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,509
too much time on it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

420
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:16,219
my developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said hey guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna</font>

421
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,000
roll this out into<font color="#CCCCCC"> dev this is how</font>

422
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,649
you're gonna have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

423
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,779
environment now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's just one</font>

424
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,850
extra hop for you and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth</font>

425
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,819
and they said that's cool but we don't

426
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">really use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssh we use this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> khoob CTL</font>

427
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:29,990
thing how many guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have played with</font>

428
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,710
coop CTL you guys okay so it's kind of

429
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the Swiss Army knife</font>

430
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,340
command-line tool for interacting with

431
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,720
your communities cluster it's something

432
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,800
that I would never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away from</font>

433
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">my developers they wouldn't really be</font>

434
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,219
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do much anywhere near as quickly</font>

435
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,750
it's super super handy but as you can

436
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,790
see from the screen shot<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully while</font>

437
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,970
I've been talking there's an issue right

438
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:53,490
with with this and that command

439
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:58,650
absolutely works who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shout</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

440
00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:00,780
what that command does on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

441
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,640
container that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want just hop into</font>

442
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,040
any container that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want so they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

443
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,020
I set up this whole nice walled garden

444
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,339
situation and my developers laughed at

445
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,579
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ran that command and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then did</font>

446
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,560
whatever they wanted right probably

447
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:17,220
comment out drink beer right but anyway

448
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,420
so they they looked at this and I got

449
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,550
kind of nervous because I didn't really

450
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to lock this down but I looked</font>

451
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,439
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hood what it's doing is</font>

452
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,390
creating an HTTPS proxy so it's not

453
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,200
using us a sage which is a port but I

454
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:34,199
can't close I hope the appt<font color="#E5E5E5"> set crowd</font>

455
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,600
understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one and and and yeah</font>

456
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,740
it's just this<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS reverse proxy to</font>

457
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,680
the communities master then the

458
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,560
communities master gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH</font>

459
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,739
connections to to the nodes and just you

460
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,599
hop right on the box this one's tricky

461
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,400
to to lock down you can get kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

462
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,050
creative and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with proxies</font>

463
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,329
to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this but</font>

464
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,500
they're not like enough security people

465
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,670
including myself have looked under the

466
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,430
hood here and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing anything</font>

467
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,380
insane so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a relatively</font>

468
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,930
secure connection they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using your</font>

469
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:08,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google credentials to hop in well at</font>

470
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,659
least in ng ke but yeah you kind of have

471
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,610
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> creative and watch out for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

472
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,910
so I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to shout it out kiss</font>

473
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:16,349
it my developers just laughing at me and

474
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,170
all the work I<font color="#CCCCCC"> put in for the jump o</font>

475
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:22,199
situation was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a good feeling my</font>

476
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,450
first week on the job<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great thanks</font>

477
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,330
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk about</font>

478
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,740
benefits really quick right so that's

479
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,909
that's enough pitfalls that you'd run

480
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,920
into if you just follow the

481
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,420
documentation and and if you are a

482
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,860
security person that's faced with a

483
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,340
company deciding if they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

484
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,620
this those are pitfalls<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's talk</font>

485
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,689
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some benefits there's some</font>

486
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,770
security benefits of containerization in

487
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,660
general

488
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,430
you know there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dozens of</font>

489
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,130
talks about that already so Mike I spent

490
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,890
too much time on it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> really quickly I</font>

491
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,600
really like when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to patching or</font>

492
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,970
if you find some sort of vulnerability

493
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,129
and some service running inside of a

494
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,410
container you know worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about patch</font>

495
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,640
management is as simple as Oh we'll just

496
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,460
rebuild that container it's going to

497
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,400
grab the latest stuff most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time</font>

498
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,080
you know or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can tweak a fix really</font>

499
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,250
quick and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then just deploy it basically</font>

500
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,740
a lot of these benefits are going to

501
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:17,130
boil down to how easy it is to deploy

502
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,270
these things and how you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

503
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,420
of natural for them to have a really

504
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:24,120
short life life cycle right if you're

505
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,100
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> microservices correctly and using</font>

506
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">containerisation correctly there should</font>

507
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,679
only be about about it should only be

508
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,810
one process per container some people

509
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,840
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use containers like their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs</font>

510
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:38,820
like hey look at my you know to page

511
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,280
long docker file that installs all of

512
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,080
this stuff on this machine as I go it's

513
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,030
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well why did you use a container</font>

514
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,139
you wanted like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one file i guess i don't</font>

515
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're for</font>

516
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,720
right using it using like like that

517
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,320
removes a lot of the benefits that

518
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,170
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get from</font>

519
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">containerisation in the long term so if</font>

520
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:00,030
if you keep it to the one process per

521
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,889
container that again limits surface area

522
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,389
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly if you're having</font>

523
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">some sort of security event you know</font>

524
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly which part of your</font>

525
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure is the culprit right and</font>

526
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:14,669
you could do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things touching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

527
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,170
it being a host agnostic it doesn't

528
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really care what vm it's running on</font>

529
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,320
right as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it knows how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run on</font>

530
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,780
that vm it doesn't care which one it's

531
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,100
on so if you have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with not the</font>

532
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,560
container if you were a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

533
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,909
underlying host you just shut that host

534
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,770
off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kuba natives will find another</font>

535
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:32,100
place to put your container right so

536
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,040
operating system level concerns security

537
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns get kind of much much easier</font>

538
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,090
fix actually right because you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

539
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,070
of pull those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of service and</font>

540
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,669
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really affect your website traffic</font>

541
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:47,700
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all segregation it gets it gets</font>

542
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:50,070
pretty easy when you break your your

543
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,770
application up in such a granular level

544
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,620
it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty easy to control what can</font>

545
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,510
talk to what right so if you have your

546
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,189
production

547
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,780
data like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying earlier right if</font>

548
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,760
you have your production level data and

549
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,980
you want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that only one</font>

550
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,570
piece of the code can access customer

551
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,600
data then you can like monitor and

552
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:11,210
surveil that all day long or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

553
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,100
put specific monitoring and if those

554
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,100
used coming around tomorrow there's a

555
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,199
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about audit d by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ryan huber you</font>

556
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,459
should definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> go see that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i used</font>

557
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,650
the tool that he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking</font>

558
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a lot to beef up some of the</font>

559
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:28,520
monitoring in very sensitive parts of

560
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,570
the application which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know it</font>

561
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,490
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy once you start</font>

562
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,070
segregating into<font color="#E5E5E5"> these micro services</font>

563
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:38,330
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lifespan of these</font>

564
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:41,030
things tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hours to days right if</font>

565
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,379
you're if you're in a agile dev

566
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,210
environment and you're using micro

567
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,410
services if using micro services you're

568
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,730
almost certainly an agile dev

569
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,640
environment right there's there's

570
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:51,410
probably Cooper<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninjas customers that</font>

571
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,550
are doing you know waterfall type stuff

572
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:57,890
but these the containers like you can

573
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,840
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coops ETL tool can pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

574
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,840
the age of all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and almost all of</font>

575
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,020
mine are sub a day maybe maybe a few

576
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,340
days kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing whereas like there's</font>

577
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,830
there's been a few tweets that go around

578
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,720
that are people bragging about how long

579
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,189
they've kept some linux server going and

580
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,450
I'm like man I feel bad if that's just

581
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,060
to administer they're trying to keep

582
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,300
this thing alive for months years that

583
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:22,190
kind of thing so again though if from a

584
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,530
security benefit point of view these

585
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,330
things go away come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back alive do</font>

586
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever they want whenever you want and</font>

587
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,370
so that limits a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of issues</font>

588
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,750
communities in general so that's

589
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">containerization communities in general</font>

590
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,260
the upgrade process is really really

591
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,270
really easy that's kind of what it's

592
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,100
built around is this whole flowing

593
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,690
containers from one note to another so

594
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,419
as you upgrade you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of just move</font>

595
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,340
things off of boxes bring up upgraded

596
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,510
boxes moving around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

597
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept that's been around for a long</font>

598
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,230
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but kuber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nettie's has it pretty</font>

599
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,670
much out of the box the logging is great

600
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,410
the build pipeline stuff container<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

601
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,570
continuous integration so that's what

602
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about here last year was</font>

603
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,770
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and continuous integration</font>

604
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:04,780
and just a harp on it a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

605
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,990
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's a nice to have</font>

606
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,129
any more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that go okay do you do</font>

607
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,280
you know how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a day do you</font>

608
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,540
push<font color="#CCCCCC"> code to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> production or or all that</font>

609
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff and that's like the new</font>

610
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,700
hot metric and everyone thought it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

611
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:20,560
like this nice to have thing it and yeah

612
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,570
it still kind of is and yeah if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

613
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,370
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money and be a high-tech</font>

614
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,950
company and get developers there's all

615
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,540
those kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefits but the attackers</font>

616
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,250
don't have a two-week release cycle

617
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,720
right people that are attacking your

618
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,370
service aren't sitting around waiting

619
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,530
for change management to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

620
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,719
their attack works against you that's

621
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a thing that ever a conversation</font>

622
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,010
that's ever happened anywhere right so

623
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:47,050
if you can't move as fast as they do

624
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,700
right in in any capacity whatsoever if

625
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,280
you don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to get your</font>

626
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,780
coat out the door quickly in a way that

627
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over it right it's not</font>

628
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,670
some crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot fix you know okay</font>

629
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,410
heartbleed came out and we're going to

630
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,880
light our hair on fire and try to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

631
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,470
as quick as we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing it's</font>

632
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's like no this is the way</font>

633
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,770
that we do things every day we've got

634
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this build pipeline and we know exactly</font>

635
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to get code out the door within</font>

636
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,860
minutes if we need to that's it's not

637
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,389
really nice to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore you have to</font>

638
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,560
move as quickly as the attackers can so

639
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,360
this stuff's going to get more important

640
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,919
as we go and here's here's kind of the

641
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">data to support that right so this is a</font>

642
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,730
screenshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the verizon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dvir i know</font>

643
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,350
it had some problems this year with some

644
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,690
other stuff but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really like this</font>

645
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:32,770
this content here and i think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

646
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,360
stands true but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically how to</font>

647
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,510
read this graph is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top one is time</font>

648
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,780
to compromise and and then the bottom

649
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">one is time to from compromise to actual</font>

650
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,810
data exfiltration so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see i</font>

651
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,310
mean the attackers are the time to

652
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,080
compromise from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time they start</font>

653
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,330
trying to compromise you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to when they</font>

654
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do is almost always in</font>

655
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,460
successful data breaches on the order of

656
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,160
minutes and and then by the time they've

657
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:03,160
gotten into the time that they got beta

658
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,170
out is on the order of days but but also

659
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,670
sometimes on the order of minutes that's

660
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:10,630
not statistically irrelevant spike there

661
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,970
so yeah good luck with that two-week

662
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,250
release cycle right if if they're if

663
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,090
they're getting data out within days and

664
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,909
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and even</font>

665
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,559
get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they got in yet you know</font>

666
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,900
good luck and talking about if they they

667
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:27,000
figured out if they got in yet let's

668
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a little bit about monitoring so if</font>

669
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,380
this is again from the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> debe IR and</font>

670
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a graph about breach discovery</font>

671
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:40,240
method right so the top method of breach

672
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,939
discovery is law enforcement which means

673
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,789
you got a call from the FBI that said

674
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,190
your customer data is on some black

675
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:49,929
market somewhere right letting you know

676
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,260
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got hacked you don't want that</font>

677
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:54,880
phone call second one is you know it's

678
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,610
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of floats between some fraud</font>

679
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,080
detection service that they might pay or

680
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,668
a third party<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I called the third</font>

681
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,639
party won the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Krebs phone call</font>

682
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:05,559
right someone someone gets a phone call

683
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,330
from Brian Krebs says hey your customers

684
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:10,120
passwords are somewhere or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Troy hunt oh</font>

685
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,460
gosh there's a new data breach and all

686
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,370
of your users are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this database right</font>

687
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,440
and then dead last there for pretty much

688
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,408
every year that they've done this is

689
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,640
internal meaning we discovered it

690
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:29,169
ourself which should be obviously the

691
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,940
highest<font color="#CCCCCC"> priority right so I like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

692
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:33,850
that it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> crew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bananas makes this</font>

693
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,409
really easy never let a<font color="#E5E5E5"> log die rights</font>

694
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,629
never let any of your container locks

695
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,700
die sis call logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> die network call logs</font>

696
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">die and you're going to watch this stuff</font>

697
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,100
because yeah you don't want to call from

698
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,649
the FBI so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I call the money</font>

699
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,990
slide and a Ryan are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I can't see</font>

700
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:51,219
Ryan in here is he in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I was</font>

701
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,110
going to point him out and make him feel

702
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,210
uncomfortable so Ryan he were like I

703
00:25:53,110 --> 00:26:00,250
said the talk tomorrow it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

704
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:01,720
this slide in our long talk forum so if

705
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,840
you guys are really interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

706
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,070
stuff definitely going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it but</font>

707
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically stuff that me and him were</font>

708
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,049
working on mostly him we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

709
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:13,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">was this this kind of roll your own</font>

710
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,460
monitoring solution that's the plays

711
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,980
really nicely in modern infrastructure

712
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,409
stacks right so if your organization

713
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,590
can't afford the crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk bill this</font>

714
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:25,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alternative right that's like</font>

715
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,000
everyone who's ever tried to talk to

716
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:29,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">spawn co is laughs about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the price but</font>

717
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,660
so yeah elasticsearch is great alternate

718
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,659
the problem is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> free like puppy not</font>

719
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,220
free like beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to really</font>

720
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,520
maintain<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff so don't don't go</font>

721
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that job lightly it is definitely</font>

722
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,970
definitely a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big undertaking to mountain</font>

723
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,940
manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own elasticsearch cluster a</font>

724
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:48,340
cool tool that sits<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top of elastic</font>

725
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">search that's open sourced by yelp it's</font>

726
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:53,320
called a last alert and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do all</font>

727
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorts of threshold monitoring and say</font>

728
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we saw this many things within</font>

729
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,460
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame send me an email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or a</font>

730
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,879
slack notification or whatever it is

731
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:07,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so that ties into slack BOTS slack</font>

732
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,060
is is a pretty pretty great security

733
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">tool if you get creative in terms of</font>

734
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,230
integrating with all sorts of alerting

735
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,790
mechanisms and let your entire team know

736
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,550
or let the very specific people that you

737
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,830
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as quickly as possible you</font>

738
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">could do and I'm stealing summer Ryan</font>

739
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,699
slender but you can do he works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

740
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,710
slack and he does some really

741
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,560
interesting stuff there I'll only tell

742
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,840
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about one is you could ask a</font>

743
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,340
developer through slack to confirm that

744
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,709
they ran a certain command on a

745
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,169
production box and then force them to

746
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:40,120
use duo or something on their phone to

747
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,470
push and do a notification their phone

748
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yeah I know that was actually me</font>

749
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,040
who ran that command on that box<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

750
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,929
though it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive command on a</font>

751
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,270
sensitive box right that's really really

752
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,520
innovative stuff that normally you would

753
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,870
pay pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> high dollar if it even exists</font>

754
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,100
and and you can you can build it

755
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:58,330
yourself it you know not not that hard

756
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's a lot of open source tools</font>

757
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:04,389
to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you rsyslog and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rel this is kind</font>

758
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,260
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the so one of the things that that we</font>

759
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:09,430
did early on was built you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

760
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,800
mentioned pods earlier right groups of

761
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,510
containers so there's concept of sidecar

762
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,250
containers right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can live next to</font>

763
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,950
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your other containers and perform</font>

764
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,080
some service for you so something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

765
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,210
an rsyslog sidecar container that can

766
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,090
suck all the logs off of your containers

767
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,440
and off of the the host<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMS and pass</font>

768
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,689
them along to something like

769
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">elasticsearch becomes really valuable</font>

770
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,040
right this is really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> valuable</font>

771
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,690
critical plumbing that that you can set

772
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,760
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then build all the alerting on</font>

773
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,380
top of that right so the project that

774
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ryan's gonna be talking about is this go</font>

775
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,060
audit it's a goal eng rewrite

776
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:45,100
using a tool called<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit d that</font>

777
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,600
monitors linux kernel's really really

778
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,610
really cool stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially when it</font>

779
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,340
comes to monitoring on public cloud

780
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,800
technologies you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor you can the</font>

781
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> benefit of the goal Lang structure</font>

782
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,669
is you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking straight to the</font>

783
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">colonel so so even really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low-level</font>

784
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware you're going to catch you're</font>

785
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,669
going to see every command run in that

786
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,170
box and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do all sorts of the</font>

787
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,550
alert and stuff with that how many

788
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:09,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have heard of OS query really</font>

789
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:12,820
interested if the handful of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

790
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:16,000
cool so OS query is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source tool</font>

791
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,980
put out by Facebook does a similar bit

792
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,750
to oddity I kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> aw daddy for</font>

793
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,330
infrastructure monitoring and then OS

794
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,040
query makes sense to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for endpoint</font>

795
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,740
monitoring even though they kind of

796
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,480
pitch it as as an everything monitoring

797
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,680
tool and it's very it's very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

798
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,200
everything that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> my personal</font>

799
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,490
stance on it but yeah that's put out by

800
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,310
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys at Facebook and what</font>

801
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,680
that does is expose operating system

802
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,330
level information in like a sequel query

803
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,030
like format so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pull this stuff</font>

804
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:45,129
out really easy obvious logs do not let

805
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,410
die or engine X and<font color="#CCCCCC"> docker right like I</font>

806
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think I have to tell a knapsack</font>

807
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,800
crowd to monitor their engine X logs if

808
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,060
they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> in genetics but just web</font>

809
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,159
logs in general you're going to want to

810
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,870
watch that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do some really cool</font>

811
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior stuff this is kind of what I</font>

812
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,879
have on the bottom here is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

813
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:04,000
there's some anomaly detection going on

814
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,330
you can look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> spikes in brute force</font>

815
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,980
attempts one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

816
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,210
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen Zane Lackey and he has a</font>

817
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">maki stocks one of the things he's been</font>

818
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:16,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about for years is just logging</font>

819
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,730
successful logins on your app versus

820
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,200
failed logins on your app is one of the

821
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">easiest things to do and one of the</font>

822
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,700
easiest spotting you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest ways</font>

823
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,100
to spot like a brute force attack coming

824
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,010
against your website right is hey we saw

825
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,110
you know 10x more failed logins in this

826
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,080
time frame then we're used to right

827
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:37,600
that's obviously something going on

828
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,010
super easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do but a lot of tools</font>

829
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,320
aren't going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for you because</font>

830
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't really know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your login</font>

831
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,450
is right what's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is any given</font>

832
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,490
applications login flow look like what

833
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,020
does their actual session<font color="#E5E5E5"> token' look</font>

834
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,790
like that stuff isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really guessable</font>

835
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,080
it's hard to productize right so that's

836
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,720
something that you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

837
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,919
for your application

838
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,170
SSH connections<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought it's a pretty</font>

839
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">obvious one you can alert on with audit</font>

840
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:06,670
d again the coop CTL stuff just laughs

841
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:09,790
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that though so so you have to do some</font>

842
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,500
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> creative things there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah the</font>

843
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:14,020
suspicious commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> I touched on that a</font>

844
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,000
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit right if you know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

845
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,220
your infrastructure what you're like

846
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">DevOps guys or Ops guys in general are</font>

847
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,250
are going to be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on any given</font>

848
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:26,649
boxes at any time to make the thing run

849
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:29,590
if they go stray from that too<font color="#E5E5E5"> far maybe</font>

850
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,780
let's create some alerts and and you

851
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:34,270
know shame them publicly in a slack room

852
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,799
about running curl<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a prod box or w</font>

853
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,690
get or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just never</font>

854
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:40,540
should happen right hey someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopped</font>

855
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:43,480
on the database and ran curl well why

856
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:47,200
let's go put them on stage and ask them

857
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,140
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never gonna be</font>

858
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,910
legit so file watches you know what

859
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,590
files are sensitive on your machines

860
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,120
right not any tool that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

861
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,590
buy is going to know every file that's

862
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,820
sensitive there's some obvious ones but

863
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,949
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some custom ones</font>

864
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,220
right and then yeah the anomalies you

865
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:06,040
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really creative things like you</font>

866
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,260
could do the math on on Logging's of hey

867
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,760
we saw a login attempt or a successful

868
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,950
login or whatever it is from this user

869
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,140
from this IP and then you could do the

870
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,179
math from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next time they log in if</font>

871
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,760
it was physically capable for them to

872
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:20,530
travel that quickly and that'll that'll

873
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,970
give you some surprising amount of

874
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,678
alerts how many times that kind of thing

875
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens right it's like okay if they</font>

876
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,240
travel in an airplane good but if they

877
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,860
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a TARDIS they couldn't have</font>

878
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,169
done this right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that kind of thing</font>

879
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:35,110
so you'd be really surprised at how many

880
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:36,880
alerts that generates so like I said

881
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,010
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my money slide I like to leave</font>

882
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,500
this up if you the slide deck will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on</font>

883
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to see this</font>

884
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,900
like an hour of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this stuff</font>

885
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,640
definitely go see Ryan's talk tomorrow

886
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:51,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so I ran pretty quickly I</font>

887
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,900
usually I give this talk standing in

888
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,200
between people and beer last time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

889
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,580
cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a few slides so you never want</font>

890
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that guy so I think we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plenty</font>

891
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,449
of time for questions if anyone has any

892
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,179
no I scared everyone come on this was my

893
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,640
less scary talk

894
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:15,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright thanks guys I appreciate it</font>
