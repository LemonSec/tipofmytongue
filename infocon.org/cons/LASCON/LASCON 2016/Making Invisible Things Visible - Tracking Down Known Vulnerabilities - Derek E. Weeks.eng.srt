00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,720
okay hey I'm Derek weeks I have some

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,240
data to share with you and I'm really

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited about it how many of you were</font>

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,959
here last<font color="#CCCCCC"> year when I presented the</font>

6
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,540
state of the software supply chain

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,840
report the first one okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it is not</font>

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:41,210
the same presentation it is we have new

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:51,640
data all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this year I was a</font>

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:56,900
WoW normally loud oh yes okay more Derek

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:01:00,050
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's entertain you so in the</font>

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,660
application economy we all know that he

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,599
who builds the best application wins and

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,060
if you're going to build an application

15
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,250
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> build it really fast because</font>

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not building it fast someone</font>

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,690
else is and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the market</font>

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,770
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and they're winning oh but</font>

19
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:20,929
fast means you actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry</font>

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,350
about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like quality and security</font>

21
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,140
and you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people here wonder</font>

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,300
about security along the way so we're

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">not writing software from scratch</font>

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:35,479
anymore in fact we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are manufacturing our</font>

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,419
software and we are doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

26
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,509
it makes us as developers how many are

27
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,330
developers in the room right you write

28
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:48,979
code good how many your security people

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:51,350
how many are both<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great okay so you</font>

30
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that you're using and others that</font>

31
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know if you're not using it they are</font>

32
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:58,130
are using open source and third-party

33
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,670
components to build their applications

34
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,310
and the average application now is about

35
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,110
eighty or ninety percent composed or the

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,229
footprint is eighty or ninety percent

37
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:14,390
open source components whether these are

38
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:18,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">java npm rubygems pi PI packages what</font>

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,779
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you right so the interesting thing</font>

40
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">about these components and some of you</font>

41
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,069
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from attending last year's</font>

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,510
session or if you've read the report is

43
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,630
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all parts are created equal right so</font>

44
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,959
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different</font>

45
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,730
versions of parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:41,880
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we counted something like</font>

47
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:44,640
67,000 instances of<font color="#E5E5E5"> jQuery that are out</font>

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,440
there and some are you know come you

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,630
know very different some are slightly

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">different some are newer versions some</font>

51
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,019
are older versions some of these

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,060
components<font color="#E5E5E5"> have known security</font>

53
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,410
vulnerabilities some have security

54
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,780
vulnerabilities yet to be discovered

55
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,350
some have different licenses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

56
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:05,010
are not created equal in terms of the

57
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,140
software so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was i think it</font>

58
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,200
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> James wicket if not I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

59
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,760
the wrong attribution but we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,859
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this anyway said you know that the</font>

61
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,709
theme of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you guys are doing</font>

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,230
is making invisible things visible and

63
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:22,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of drove the theme of</font>

64
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the report this year that we at sonatype</font>

65
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,230
where I work can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that other</font>

66
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,900
firms cannot easily see because we run

67
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,060
something called the maven central the

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,490
central repository is the largest home

69
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,830
of open source components for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java</font>

70
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,230
development in the world and that's part

71
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,320
of what I base my research on this year

72
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,820
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share with you on on</font>

73
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,620
what's happening in development so

74
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,329
there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization that I work with</font>

75
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to help paint the</font>

76
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,780
picture of what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

77
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,630
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can understand why it is so</font>

78
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,930
pertinent that we pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to this</font>

79
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,549
issue when we all know using known

80
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,550
vulnerabilities and open source

81
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:11,820
components is in the OWASP top 10 is the

82
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,410
a9 right why is that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk</font>

83
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,950
through like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

84
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,019
explicitly why this is in the top 10 so

85
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,358
there's an organization in the United

86
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">States that I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working with over</font>

87
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,280
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years and that</font>

88
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:30,290
organization last year it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

89
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,140
healthcare field consumed 16 million

90
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:37,350
open source components from maven

91
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,260
central they have about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

92
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,440
developers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they employ they</font>

93
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,480
downloaded 16 million components last

94
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,120
year

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:51,450
now a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail that we have</font>

96
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what what they're doing of these</font>

97
00:04:51,450 --> 00:05:01,620
component how many were unique about

98
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">5,000 if you strip out all the versions</font>

99
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,230
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> components that they downloaded</font>

100
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,780
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at if I just wanted the</font>

101
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:14,480
best version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of every one of those</font>

102
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,479
components<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many would I need guess</font>

103
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:26,100
202,000 I need 2,000 components to do

104
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,010
software development across two thousand

105
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,860
developers right if I chose the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best one</font>

106
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:35,640
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm downloading those 16 million</font>

107
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,620
times right and as I'm freely

108
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,780
downloading those and bring them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

109
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,110
organization some of them have known

110
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,450
security vulnerabilities anyone want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

111
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,970
guess how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of the 16 million had a</font>

112
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:58,400
known vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay 67% there's</font>

113
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:58,400
always a pessimist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the row right soup</font>

114
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:08,310
seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> 773</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand component had a known</font>

115
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:12,510
vulnerability day one of download right

116
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,850
now let's walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

117
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,620
numbers so the numbers are important

118
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,750
partly because why are you downloading

119
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,290
16 million components you're a developer

120
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,180
right you have a deadline right do you

121
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,830
want to code from scratch or do you just

122
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to pull something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the internet</font>

123
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,090
that already does that so you can meet

124
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,150
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> deadline get done with your day</font>

125
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,729
make your boss happy go home have pizza

126
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,280
with your kids right you want the gains

127
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,169
in efficiency that that provides and yes

128
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,510
you may download the part more than one

129
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,280
time throughout the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes you may</font>

130
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,010
use more than one version but this is

131
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:51,000
efficiency this is time to market he who

132
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:53,789
builds the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> software wins right so</font>

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,860
there are trade-offs though within that

134
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:58,020
and that's some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're going to</font>

135
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,440
see in this year's report so this

136
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,240
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3,000 top</font>

137
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">performing software development</font>

138
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,699
organizations consuming open source

139
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,639
components across the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also</font>

140
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:14,069
did a deeper dive into<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25,000</font>

141
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,440
applications that are using open source

142
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:18,150
components to better understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the</font>

143
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,139
components are being used where they're

144
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:24,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">being used etc so for those of you that</font>

145
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,849
aren't familiar with a software supply

146
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,039
chain it is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple concept to</font>

147
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:31,080
understand because software supply

148
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,139
chains work like any other supply chain

149
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,210
in any other manufacturing industry you

150
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,960
have suppliers how many of you are part

151
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,849
of an open source project right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

152
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,969
you're part of the suppliers you are

153
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:47,610
building software for other people to

154
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,469
use when you build that software you

155
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,810
just don't say hey it's on my server

156
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,430
sitting out there you place it somewhere

157
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,500
on the internet like one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

158
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,340
central warehouses like maven central

159
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,190
where NP MJS<font color="#CCCCCC"> org or rubygems.org or pi</font>

160
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,500
PI to python org<font color="#CCCCCC"> and one of these places</font>

161
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,139
is a central warehouse where developers

162
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,110
worldwide can download and consume that

163
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,139
into their manufacturing process or

164
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,060
software development process and create

165
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,699
finished goods from it the software

166
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,740
applications that we are all building as

167
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,550
products or services for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our customers</font>

168
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:29,370
so these supply chains are very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

169
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:31,680
full effect operating globally and for

170
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,709
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are developing the best</font>

171
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">software out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're understanding</font>

172
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:40,319
that not only can we are we operating

173
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,899
with software supply chains but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,170
take lessons from Deming that he was

175
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:48,690
teaching at Toyota 40<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 50 years ago</font>

176
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:53,490
right that if we use the best quality

177
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:55,410
parts from the best suppliers and we

178
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,420
track and trace those over time so if

179
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,390
any go bad we know where they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

180
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,760
can recall them and fix those problems

181
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,069
right those lessons can be applied to

182
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,040
software right we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font>

183
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,260
pick any project right we can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

184
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,610
best ones we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> five do we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

185
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand parts</font>

186
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,079
do we need the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of each of</font>

187
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:19,649
those parts to use within our software

188
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:22,500
right do we need 2,000 suppliers right

189
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,750
so if you had two thousand unique parts

190
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,310
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that 16 million that's 2,000</font>

191
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,800
parts well how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of those are kind of</font>

192
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,439
similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one from another</font>

193
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,349
project do I need four or five<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

194
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,630
suppliers for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a logging framework or web</font>

195
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:41,670
application framework or cryptology or

196
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:44,250
whatever you would need so you need to

197
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best suppliers out there</font>

198
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,610
and then as we said track and trace over

199
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:55,529
time so let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

200
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:57,540
supply of components out there we looked

201
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,279
at and we did this in last year's report

202
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,769
as well there's a site out there called

203
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,140
module counts<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm all it does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

204
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:08,100
supplies a really colorful chart like

205
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:11,250
this and it has different lines for

206
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,680
different component types across all

207
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,470
development languages whether it's go or

208
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,880
Python or Ruby or Java what have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

209
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,860
says here's how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

210
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">components are available for these</font>

211
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,949
ecosystems and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did by analyzing</font>

212
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,699
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data from their site about those</font>

213
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:32,459
components as we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out globally 1000</font>

214
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:36,240
new open source projects enter the

215
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:38,160
market every day 1,000 new suppliers are

216
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,699
available to software developers

217
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,410
worldwide every day of all the open

218
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:46,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">source projects out there we're</font>

219
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:49,380
estimating 10,000 new versions of

220
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:52,680
components are released every single day

221
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,850
a massive number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of suppliers a massive</font>

222
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of parts and when I looked at</font>

223
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,040
380,000 open source projects that

224
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,329
contribute to maven central those

225
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,649
organizations are releasing on average

226
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:10,079
14 new versions a year so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

227
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:12,269
massive supply that's available to you

228
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing right suppliers</font>

229
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:16,170
are out there building software and they

230
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,149
figured out just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have how do I</font>

231
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,729
make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> better how do I make that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

232
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,250
feature-rich higher performance less

233
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,139
buggy fix the flaw fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

234
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,220
defect what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

235
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:31,170
so there's good reason for that behavior

236
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,170
now last year when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was here we were</font>

237
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,389
talking about unimaginable numbers right

238
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,179
and part of that is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many download</font>

239
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:42,119
request did we see from<font color="#E5E5E5"> maven central</font>

240
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:46,049
last year right so last year we had just

241
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:50,720
reached 17 billion this past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

242
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:50,720
reached 30 1 billion download request

243
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,699
31like I can't imagine that I couldn't

244
00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:00,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine 17 billion last year I can't</font>

245
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:02,579
imagine 30 1 billion this year there are

246
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:05,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 million Java developers on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet</font>

247
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:07,858
right that number is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray it wasn't</font>

248
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:10,559
five million the year before in 10

249
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:13,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">million this year right it's pretty</font>

250
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,149
stable right in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

251
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:19,829
developers out there that are consuming

252
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:21,540
these components this is just tweeted by

253
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:27,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">Laurie Voss he's one of the guys that</font>

254
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:33,719

JavaScript NPM space there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a massive</font>

amount of consumption happening out

260
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:56,910
there if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think your organization is</font>

261
00:12:51,809 --> 00:13:00,749
using open source right you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

262
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,488
been you are in droves right when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

263
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:05,160
working with a company last<font color="#E5E5E5"> week in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

264
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:07,649
financial services space they said yeah

265
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,079
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're working with sonatype and</font>

266
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,939
we are helping this organization to do

267
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,649
an audit of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much open source they</font>

268
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:15,539
were using across their application they

269
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,949
have an open source governance process

270
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:19,259
because they're in the financial

271
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:21,719
services space with a lot of all of our

272
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,449
pertinent information and they said we

273
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a process a governance check that</font>

274
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:28,559
understands how many components we have

275
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:32,279
in development how many are used and we

276
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,709
have about 800 approved components right

277
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,149
so that's pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we did</font>

278
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,888
<font color="#E5E5E5">the audit and told them there were</font>

279
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,670
thirteen thousand open source code

280
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:44,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">opponents in their application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> portfolio</font>

281
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:48,009
right that's what the difference is

282
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,889
between kind of guessing how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

283
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,959
have or forcing developers to go through

284
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:55,209
a process to approve components that

285
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,479
they will use and when your process like

286
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:01,238
their process was it minimum two weeks

287
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,269
and usually six weeks and sometimes nine

288
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:08,199
weeks in one time nine months to approve

289
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:10,359
a component right developers will find a

290
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:14,889
workaround why because you're a pain in

291
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:16,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">the butt to say it nicely if you are</font>

292

<font color="#E5E5E5">taking that long to approve a new</font>

293
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,279
component you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have eight or ten</font>

294
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:23,019
times more open source in your

295
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,959
environment than you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

296
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:30,339
governing we need a more sophisticated

297
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:33,699
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thinking about how software is</font>

298
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:36,759
developed and we need that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only if</font>

299
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:38,319
you're a DevOps person you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

300
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,299
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many parts and how many</font>

301
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:42,399
suppliers and how much variants and

302
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:45,309
variation is there in my supply chain

303
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,889
because we know toyota in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the camry this</font>

304
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:50,799
year isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> using 27 different muffler</font>

305
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:53,019
suppliers right they have one and they

306
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,939
have the best one right and because

307
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:57,129
they've limited the variation and

308
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:59,469
variability in their supply chain they

309
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,749
can better control the quality if you're

310
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,660
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security person you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand</font>

311
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:06,189
this and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the reason why</font>

312
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,618
I've done this report two years in a row

313
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:11,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on the third one already</font>

314
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:13,689
is because if you understand what's

315
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:15,759
happening out there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

316
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:17,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it differently and if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

317
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,509
about it differently you can come up

318
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,819
with solutions and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> company has</font>

319
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:23,980
commercial solutions related to this

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,519
OS dependency check last year six point

325
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:41,199
two percent of the downloads from the

326
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,439
central repository had a known

had a known vulnerability that works out

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,630
to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in 15 or 1 in 16 components</font>

331
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:58,120
add a known vulnerability from day one

<font color="#E5E5E5">we can't remove the components with</font>

remember who remembers<font color="#CCCCCC"> npm gate like and</font>

336
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,520
when was that it wasn't februari it was

337
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,560
mayish right yeah some developer was

338
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,689
being threatened or to be sued because

339
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,880
his component was called kick and kick

340
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">one and the kick organization wanted to</font>

341
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,830
sue them sue him for<font color="#CCCCCC"> using that name</font>

342
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,870
within a component which he had a long

343
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:29,860
time ago so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he removed the component</font>

344
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:32,320
from NP MJS org and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 builds</font>

345
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,900
broke within you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

346
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,360
there was chaos there and it wasn't an

347
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,370
immutable repository and<font color="#CCCCCC"> built or</font>

348
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,710
breaking so they put back apart that

349
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:46,660
they believed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that that missing</font>

350
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:49,060
part you can't if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

351
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,610
fix a bad piece or bad component that

352
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,949
you have you need the older original

353
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">component to recreate your application</font>

354
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then replace it with the good one</font>

355
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,060
and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the part is bad for you</font>

356
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,949
doesn't mean it's bad for you and we

357
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,730
don't know the use case scenario so we

358
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:09,880
can't remove the bad ones but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there can</font>

359
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:14,920
be ways like dependency check to tell

360
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:17,740
people what's a good one so within these

361
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,660
downloads that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw the no one here is</font>

362
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,540
downloading billions of components in

363
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,800
their organization so the average

364
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,260
downloads that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw across these three</font>

365
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,200
thousand organizations were about two

366
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,690
hundred twenty-nine thousand components

367
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,420
overall just like that organization

368
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,970
that's downloading 16 million there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

369
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:40,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five thousand unique parts within</font>

370
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:42,130
that and about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand if you strip</font>

371
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,410
out all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different versions so the</font>

372
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,050
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of parts is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 the number of</font>

373
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,380
suppliers is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two thousand that you</font>

374
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:54,879
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or you're managing through your</font>

375
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:57,160
infrastructure so one of the things that

376
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">we also saw was within this population</font>

377
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,620
of development organizations about seven

378
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:06,370
and a half percent of what they were

379
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:10,510
downloading so that's like one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one</font>

380
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:13,870
15<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 14 someone do the math but that's a</font>

381
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,150
lot right no<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-speed development or</font>

382
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:19,989
manufacturing operation globally

383
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:22,180
operates with a defect rate like this at

384
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,490
high velocity and the higher velocity

385
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,710
that you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you move at and want to</font>

386
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,490
maintain quality of which security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

387
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:34,390
only one aspect is a challenge that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

388
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:39,490
can fix with the proper with the proper

389
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:41,590
approaches so just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a software</font>

390
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,260
component and we had this<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion</font>

391
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,020
last year as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well just because a</font>

392
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:50,230
software component is downloaded does

393
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,480
not mean that you used it right sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

394
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,830
downloaded it i was you know testing out

395
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,950
the design<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some part of the</font>

396
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,199
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm building right it was a</font>

397
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:04,600
snapshot build<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know what version</font>

398
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,370
exactly i was using right so that so

399
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,409
that version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that component was</font>

400
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,899
downloaded but what we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

401
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,660
this year was we look not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only at the</font>

402
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:17,320
downloads with 6.1<font color="#CCCCCC"> % vulnerable we</font>

403
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,970
looked at about 3,000 repository

404
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,220
managers these are where some

405
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,440
development teams keep their components

406
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,910
locally where they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> them or</font>

407
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,160
they don't rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the central</font>

408
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,440
repositories fully but the local

409
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,840
repository managers that house these in

410
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,840
about five and a half percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

411
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,790
had a known vulnerability in them when

412
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,120
we looked across 25 thousand

413
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:43,210
applications that had we're using open

414
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,309
source components within them we found

415
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that six point eight percent of the</font>

416
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,540
components across all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

417
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,330
applications had a known security

418
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,659
vulnerability in them so what that tells

419
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,610
me is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> software components that are</font>

420
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,370
entering the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the supply chain</font>

421
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:03,250
are flowing through the supply chain

422
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,010
into the finished applications that if

423
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,870
you have vetting processes in place they

424
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,570
are not catching<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough of what's</font>

425
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,879
happening out there and maybe if they're

426
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,550
certainly if they're manual they are not

427
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,680
keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> pace with the volume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

428
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:22,260
being consumed out there that that

429
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:26,640
organization with 16 million downloads

430
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:28,440
they employ one person who looks at open

431
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,380
source components and approve them and

432
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,120
only for licenses they have no one

433
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,270
employee that checks security

434
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,370
vulnerabilities in those components it's

435
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:42,230
just not part of license risk is a

436
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:45,419
higher risk for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> than security risk</font>

437
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,640
imagine that who's seen this that this

438
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:55,380
tweet from I am developer this is like

439
00:20:47,640 --> 00:21:01,560
one of my favorite right so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

440
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:04,050
light week so about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

441
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">source 106 open source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> components are</font>

442
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:09,120
used in the application right and what

443
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:13,620
we saw last year was that amounts in the

444
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,110
percentage of components that<font color="#CCCCCC"> amounts to</font>

445
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,590
about seven of those have at least one

446
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:21,689
known security defect in them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

447
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,550
you're consuming thousands of components

448
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:27,270
across your applications within an

449
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:30,240
enterprise right looks fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> dude I have</font>

450
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:33,780
a deadline right I know that there I was

451
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,280
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone last night their</font>

452
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:40,590
company that builds software in the

453
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,149
financial services industry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

454
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,459
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> said yes i know we have</font>

455
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,100
vulnerable components in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code right</font>

456
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,850
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a deadline so i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> waving</font>

457
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:53,790
that you know that jira ticket right and

458
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,050
then you know they go to release the

459
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,120
software again still has the

460
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,399
vulnerability in it they flag it now

461
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,110
it's waived again right they flag it

462
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,850
again they<font color="#E5E5E5"> waive it again right I've got</font>

463
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,639
a deadline to me I know there's a

464
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:08,850
vulnerability in it I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to</font>

465
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,570
fix it right and then we're wondering

466
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:16,010
why we're being breached along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

467
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,810
so here's some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool stuff that</font>

468
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:23,580
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know Bruce Mayhew works</font>

469
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:25,950
on web goat Bruce you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know Bruce</font>

470
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,220
Bruce is a really brilliant guy comes

471
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:31,800
into my office six months ago he's like

472
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,960
Derek I've got this amazing data and he

473
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,279
spends like an hour and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a half</font>

474
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,110
laying into me like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get it so</font>

475
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,570
but thanks for sharing that and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

476
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,299
day I like ah I've got it here<font color="#CCCCCC"> too what</font>

477
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:49,408
Bruce was telling me from the analysis

478
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:51,330
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25,000 applications was that of all</font>

479
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:54,360
the components used in the applications

480
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:57,330
the blue line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is showing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me what is the</font>

481
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,149
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> age of a component across those</font>

482
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,949
applications so one year old components

483
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:04,918
make up about eighteen percent of the

484
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,020
app apps two year old components or just

485
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,029
over twenty percent seven-year-old

486
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,029
components are about five percent of

487
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:16,529
those used across these applications and

488
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:18,630
then we did a look at security

489
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:20,850
vulnerabilities in those so one two

490
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,860
three year old components have just

491
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,230
under five percent of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> components</font>

492
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,360
having known vulnerability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

493
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,940
at eight nine ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old you're</font>

494
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,610
almost at fifteen percent of those have

495
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,320
a known security vulnerability so when

496
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,729
we're talking about use the best

497
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:42,120
versions apart from the best suppliers

498
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:44,490
component age matters right so the

499
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,709
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of components</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are over four</font>

500
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:50,429
years old in the applications is like

501
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:52,919
sixty-seven percent of components you're

502
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:55,679
using component parts that are four plus

503
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,350
years old in some cases 9 and 10 years

504
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,630
old when there are newer versions more

505
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,549
functional<font color="#E5E5E5"> better performing components</font>

506
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:06,510
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that you could use in your</font>

507
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:10,168
applications and if you move people

508
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:12,690
toward used not the newest but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

509
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:15,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">the more latest like in the last three</font>

510
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">years latest component then the number</font>

511
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:19,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">of security defects across your</font>

512
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,380
population your security debt will

513
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:25,860
decrease substantially if you can put in

514
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,140
a practice that says in governance we're

515
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:32,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to tell you use components</font>

516
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:35,580
that are three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years old or younger</font>

517
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:38,549
right simple government you could have

518
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,570
nothing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with security in that is</font>

519
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:45,059
security focus in that governance policy

520
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,658
it's just use newer components for

521
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,729
developers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care about</font>

522
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:51,399
security but you can reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

523
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:55,299
security debt substantially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give</font>

524
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:58,149
everyone the slides afterwards I'll tell

525
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:00,039
you how to get them quickly the oh the

526
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:03,219
other thing in here so when we used

527
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:06,658
looked at these applications in terms of

528
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:10,269
using newer versions of components in

529
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:12,669
this analysis is what also<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce came to</font>

530
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:15,909
me with and said out of all these

531
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:18,879
applications the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of components</font>

532
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:21,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are on the latest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> version 1 year</font>

533
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:24,158
old components about 13% or on the

534
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:26,228
latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> version 5 year old components</font>

535
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">fourteen percent are on their latest</font>

536
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:32,739
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine year old components twenty</font>

537
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:35,908
percent are on their latest version<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

538
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:38,799
quick translation of what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

539
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:41,320
nine-year-old components twenty percent

540
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,229
or on the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> version you're using a</font>

541
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:49,090
piece of software that someone developed

542
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:53,229
nine years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago it has never released a</font>

543
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:56,678
newer version that is either a perfect

544
00:25:53,229 --> 00:26:05,440
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software that was so good right</font>

545
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:09,340
in two thousand and was a 2007 right yes

546
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,259
sorry so 2007 someone developed that

547
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,269
perfect piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software or this is a</font>

548
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:15,729
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> where someone developed a cool</font>

549
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:18,580
piece of software that may've still

550
00:26:15,729 --> 00:26:21,220
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used widely in use right but no</font>

551
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,960
newer version has been developed or

552
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,970
released in that and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

553
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,460
versions that have three times more

554
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,710
security defects<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the younger</font>

555
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,090
versions so you have older versions that

556
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,470
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> non supported and if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

557
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,019
remove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a higher chance</font>

558
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:39,059
that there is no alternative newer

559
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:42,039
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that non-secure component</font>

560
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:45,580
available to you so again using new

561
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:50,580
component is important to have within

562
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the portfolio yep</font>

563
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:09,480
yes older components are used in older

564
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:12,030
applications but of these 25,000 that we

565
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,470
are analyzing they are actively under

566
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:19,560
development right so if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a we</font>

567
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:22,470
scanned the portfolio of<font color="#CCCCCC"> JPMC which has</font>

568
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,480
applications you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to name a</font>

569
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,210
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications dating back to the</font>

570
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">80s right that didn't even have the open</font>

571
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,810
source components in them yes that would

572
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a good argument when we're looking at</font>

573
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:36,360
active development going on usually

574
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,889
involving continuous delivery continuous

575
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,830
integration platforms where they're

576
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing higher speed development it makes</font>

577
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,460
less sense the argument is true there

578
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,500
are older applications with older parts

579
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,720
there are components that have

580
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,710
dependencies that are older dependencies

581
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,110
that have never been updated right but

582
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,940
again making the invisible visible the

583
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,469
more we're aware of this the more we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

584
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,750
start to think how do we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

585
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,870
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem and what are the</font>

586
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:12,930
ways that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go about resolving</font>

587
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:16,169
resolving it yes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is true they have</font>

588
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:18,300
less they have less vote they have less

589
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,520
known vulnerabilities because they

590
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,669
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been discovered yet we often say</font>

591
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,200
software ages like milk not wine right

592
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,510
so the longer it's out there the more

593
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,330
popular it gets the more folks like you

594
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:32,100
start to look at hey wonder what's in

595
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,159
this code I wonder if there is a

596
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,899
vulnerability and aha you know I've

597
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,020
discovered something<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's a natural</font>

00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">progression of what we've seen right but</font>

599
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,060
you if you want to have stronger

600
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:48,000
fortification of your applications in

601
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:51,300
your portfolio keeping up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to date with</font>

602
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> newer component will help you just</font>

603
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:58,260
buy the the percentages so someone that

604
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,450
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to earlier out there when</font>

605
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,510
I was doing my slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I would</font>

606
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,200
bring up apple and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

607
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">was februari</font>

608
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,159
very of this year this seems longer than

609
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:14,250
that ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple in the FBI were kind of</font>

610
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,370
going at it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were going at</font>

611
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:20,730
it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple had placed very strong</font>

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:23,549
encryption technology into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone</font>

613
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:26,269
right and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI wanted in and you can</font>

614
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:28,889
fall on either side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the argument on</font>

615
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:31,529
whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be allowed you know</font>

616
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:35,428
to break that encryption or not but part

617
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:37,490
of what part of what I saw with in my

618
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:40,980
research when this was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I</font>

619
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,899
contacted our data team and I said you

620
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">know there's a component called bouncy</font>

621
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:49,350
castle everyone knows right crypto right

622
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,019
so I want secure communication

623
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:54,330
capabilities inside this part of my

624
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:56,669
application so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bouncy</font>

625
00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:00,299
castle and bouncy castle is incredibly

626
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:04,980
popular right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year in 2015 there</font>

627
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:08,820
were 17.3 million component downloads of

628
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,380
bouncy castle from maven central 17.3

629
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,570
million there's only 10 million<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java</font>

630
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:16,950
developers on the planet it's popular

631
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:21,059
right I mean yeah just<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the math it's</font>

632
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:24,240
popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so of those right bouncy</font>

633
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:27,658
castle let me say is an excellent open

634
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,870
source project and supplier quality

635
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,510
ranks very high when they have a problem

636
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a known security vulnerability is</font>

637
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,908
discovered in it this project fixes

638
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,440
their component and releases a fix a

639
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:43,889
newer version of the component that

640
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:48,059
fixes that vulnerability quickly right

641
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:50,549
so 5.8 million thirty-three percent of

642
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,799
the component downloads last year were

643
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:55,740
the known vulnerable versions of bouncy

644
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,918
castle there are perfectly sound

645
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,830
versions available perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

646
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,000
versions available yet one third of the

00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:08,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">downloads were known vulnerable 13,000</font>

within their applications voluntarily

650
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,739
chose elected to download the known

651
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,870

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,360
if they didn't go through and check<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey</font>

653
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,610
is this encryption does this encryption

654
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,469
actually work so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

that just downloaded whatever they want

right that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy so Commons</font>

know that right this was ransomware

671
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:22,150
right right and how did how did they get

672
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:25,000
in right jboss as a Commons collection

673
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:28,570
known vulnerability in it and they were

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,700
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit that infrastructure and</font>

survey again but it was almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,790
years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we asked 33 thousand</font>

809
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:40,130
developers do you have an open source

810
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:42,200
governance program and i think it was

811
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:45,109
fifty percent or so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty seven percent</font>

812
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,549
said yes fifty-seven percent said yes

813
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:47,930
and then we asked do you follow it and

814
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:50,660
only sixty-eight percent of those

815
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:53,149
followed it right because it was too

816
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:57,230
cumbersome to keep pace with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> volume</font>

817
00:38:53,150 --> 00:39:00,170
that they were consuming it so i'm going

and where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can build these into these</font>

874
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:33,200
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of policies into things like</font>

Jenkins and bamboo and Hudson<font color="#E5E5E5"> and team</font>

every build within seconds of for every

879
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,460
build you can evaluate every component

880
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,740
in that build and have a manifest built

881
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,810
of all the components and check those

882
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:53,450
against policies whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's security</font>

883
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:57,410
or licenses or age of the components or

884
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:59,990
whatever your policy might be you can

885
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,899
create who is created at a software<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill</font>

886
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:05,180
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> materials anyone used dependency</font>

887
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,850
check I mean that's basically what it

888
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:11,480
does right if you haven't go out and

889
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:14,720
it's free God and try it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> evaluate it</font>

890
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,490
to analyze an application there's a link

891
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,250
up here in the slides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll provide</font>

892
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:22,220
you we have a free tool that does it as

893
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,020
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes about like I scan Jenkins</font>

894
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,129
I scanned our<font color="#E5E5E5"> nexus repository</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source prod</font>

896
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:31,650
it takes 15 sec 10 15 seconds to produce

897
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,500
a bill of materials it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple</font>

898
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,910
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty fast you'll be amazed at</font>

937
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube yes so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is if you're</font>

938
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:27,630
buying open source applications or

939
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:29,190
you're getting open source applications

940
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:36,510
and then you're buying support is that

941
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:38,070
better for you yes because one if you

942
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,930
analyze that application

943
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,690
if you run a software bill of materials

944
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:44,190
for and you see there are known security

945
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,560
vulnerabilities you can go to that

946
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,630
organization say hey I'm paying for

947
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,520
support and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I'm a security</font>

948
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional by the way you have known</font>

949
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,250
vulnerable components in this and would

950
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you fix them right if you don't have</font>

951
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,760
support you can still make the same

952
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,920
request to just you know you might have

953
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,080
more ears depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how much you're</font>

954
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,710
paying them but an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

955
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,630
application has no more or less number

956
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,630
of open source components than<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed</font>

957
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:14,640
source and even you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know proprietary</font>

958
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:19,080
software has just as many components in

959
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,629
it so I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wrap out but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be</font>

960
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:24,020
here all day so how many same thing

961
