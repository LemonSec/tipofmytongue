00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,910
to kind of convey the importance of risk

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,210
management as part of an overall

before we start to talk I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,250

so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know technologies have bring have</font>

65
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,660
brought us a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of benefits and we use</font>

66
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,840
internet we use cell phone we use our

67
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,660
smartphones we use computers in every

aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our lives and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pretty soon</font>

69
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,820
we'll have you know we'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

70
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,680
self-driving cars at least I'm expecting

71
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,070
when I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> older you know I can't</font>

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,970
drive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we have smart homes and</font>

73
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:38,870
so technology is basically running our

74
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:42,130
lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand it can</font>

75
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,780
also make all of us another society

76
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,510
vulnerable you know we have our homes

77
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,480
our government our whole infrastructure

78
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:55,720
runs on technology and they may fail

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,720
they may be abused Oh may be attacked

80
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,380
yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure many of you remember</font>

81
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:08,600
three years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this time they</font>

82
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:12,049
target breach personal information of a

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:16,370
hundred ten million customers has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

84
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:19,430
stolen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know the cost for for</font>

85
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:23,450
target is a hundred forty-eight million

86
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:27,350
dollars not even counting the change to

87
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:30,200
EMV card anybody knows the EMV card the

88
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,320
credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card with with chip right so not</font>

89
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,770
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> counting that cost 140 million</font>

90
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,139
dollars what happened

91
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:42,560
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite simple somebody</font>

92
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:46,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">still the username password of their</font>

93
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,370
HVAC vendor and then use that credential

94
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:51,289
and turn the target Network if you think

95
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it that credential should have</font>

96
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:56,240
limited rights rightful monitoring the

97
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:59,090
energy use or control the temperature

98
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,770
but in the fact the attacker went

99
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,409
through the network without being

100
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,740
detected and then what the attacker

101
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:09,319
download malware to all the

102
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,460
point-of-sale terminals so when you

103
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,740
swipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> your credit card at a target your</font>

104
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,659
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen and then when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

105
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,110
steal<font color="#CCCCCC"> your credit card information what</font>

106
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:24,110
can they do they make duplicated cards

107
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,789
they sell them in the black market you

108
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,460
know that's one reason they sell they

109
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:30,440
change to smoke hard bass the EMV card

110
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,989
that's a different story that at least

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:38,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">you cannot duplicate ah so target is not</font>

112
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:42,440
alone and that there are all these

113
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,840
companies they all have one kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,840
reach or another they lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meanings</font>

115
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,258
of hence the mailings users information

116
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,599
or data record in fact I work as you

117
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,880
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gemalto which is a</font>

118
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:59,270
digital security company we have

hundred more than 1600 data breaches

122

records being compromised among them

124

fifty-three percent of data breaches

125

everybody it's not just company

127

affecting individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you</font>

128
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,770
know the interesting thing when you look

129
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:33,289
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the target breach as an example</font>

130
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,169
is people all have their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinions</font>

131
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:38,860
about what went wrong right was it the

132
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:41,599
target trusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party HVAC vendor</font>

133
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,880
and they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that trust in that company</font>

134
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,560
and then that trust was breached<font color="#E5E5E5"> or was</font>

135
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,409
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the HVAC vendor and their failure to</font>

136
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,330
protect the credentials or once the the

137
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,919
attacker made their way from the HVAC

138
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,870
enter credentials on to the target

139
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,330
Network and breach the systems was there

140
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,310
a failure there or you know I've seen

141
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,109
reports about how you know the fire I

142
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,659
alerts were going off at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Target and</font>

nobody was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the logs and you</font>

144
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:06,560
know the interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about all</font>

145
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,139
this is that none<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really matters</font>

146
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the real issue behind what happened</font>

147
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,860
with target was that they didn't do the

148
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:15,139
proper risk assessment to identify what

149
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,879
those risks were and they didn't figure

150
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:20,719
out here's how we mitigate those risks

151
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,879
so we're all targets right risks are

152
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:25,250
everywhere they're they're everywhere

153
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,690
from you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> alarm system that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

154
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,009
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my house because I'm afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

155
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to break in and steal</font>

156
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:33,979
my nice stuff all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to my heir</font>

157
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,990
prize and the systems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we build and</font>

158
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,580
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so really the the</font>

159
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">question that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we ask is how do we</font>

160
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect ourselves and the customers that</font>

161
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,940
we serve how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually manage risks</font>

162
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,969
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really what we hope to</font>

163
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,360
address here today so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start and</font>

164
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:52,460
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is risk ryan</font>

165
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,710
risk is a potential than action or

166
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,440
activity including the choice of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in act</font>

167
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,628
in action which happens all the time

168
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,789
right somebody says<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not going to</font>

169
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:04,370
do anything about that will lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

170
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,919
loss or some sort of undesirable outcome

171
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,810
so technically risk is basically the

172
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,089
probability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an attacker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explained</font>

173
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,250
vulnerability and causing some harm or

174
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:16,129
some loss now the cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that</font>

175
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,770
risk isn't just a vulnerability risk

176
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,469
isn't just you know if this if this

177
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,419
thing happens then it's bad risk can be

178
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,250
all over the place risk can be technical

179
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,710
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can also be financial right it</font>

180
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,629
can be the risk of financial loss it can

181
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,729
be the risk of reputation damage if

182
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:34,370
something bad happens it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

183
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,838
regulatory issues like hey you can't

184
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,719
process credit cards anymore because

185
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,240
you're no longer PCI compliant business

186
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,010
interruption even safety hazards things

187
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,329
like hey you know there's a hole in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

188
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">roof and there's a puddle on the floor</font>

189
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:48,050
and somebody can slip and fall right

190
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,899
that's a risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's something that</font>

191
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,930
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to capture so risk management is</font>

192
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:56,060
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process it's a process that we use to</font>

193
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,550
identify assess the risks are in our

194
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment once we know the risks are</font>

195
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,390
in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment our next step is to</font>

196
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,150
determine how we're going to prioritize

197
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,100
what

198
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,459
fixed because anybody here have

199
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,710
unlimited budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay neither not not</font>

200
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,750
today right neither do i right and so

201
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,820
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is we're going to</font>

202
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,460
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with more risks than we have</font>

203
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,170
money to fix it so somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> someway we</font>

204
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,180
have to figure out this is the most

205
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,800
important thing that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost the</font>

206
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,859
least amount of money now I'm going to

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,689
be able to fix today or tomorrow or with

208
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,700
the limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources that have and</font>

209
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,830
resources isn't always just about money

210
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,130
sometimes it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and work</font>

211
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,560
cycles right so once we do that

212
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,300
prioritization we determine what we're

213
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,619
going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this right well how are</font>

214
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">we going to actually fix this problem</font>

215
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,540
and then the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea behind our risk</font>

216
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,250
management process is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive</font>

217
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,230
visibility and accountability for

218
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,090
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those are the</font>

219
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,030
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who hold the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purse strings so I</font>

220
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,460
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said right not everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

221
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,290
nobody here has a limited budget and

222
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">what that means is we're all fighting</font>

223
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,290
for the dollars within our organization

224
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,180
we're all trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you know a</font>

225
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,800
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those purse strings a</font>

226
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,800
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of that money to be able</font>

227
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to afford fixing these issues and so</font>

228
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,920
risk management is the way that we

229
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,350
highlight these issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our managers</font>

230
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,060
to the executive team and we say look

231
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,740
here's the biggest risks in our air our

232
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,900
environment these are the most critical

233
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,640
things here's what's going here's how we

234
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,220
plan on fixing it here's what's going

235
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,990
cost to fix it right so risk management

236
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,250
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use to</font>

237
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,650
drive those improvements in our

238
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,260
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really justify how we're</font>

239
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:35,579
spending money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the executive team so</font>

240
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:38,400
how does risk relate to app sec well we

241
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,760
have our traditional CIA confidentiality

242
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,400
integrity and availability right and so

243
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,530
risk is all about how do we identify

244
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things how do we figure out places</font>

245
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,060
where we might have a breaching

246
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,700
confidentiality where we might lose that

247
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,219
data that's a functional requirement

248
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">right integrity how do we figure out</font>

249
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,030
areas where we might breach the

250
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,939
integrity of the application somebody

251
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,819
might modify it or change the data

252
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,360
underneath it and availability right we

253
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,540
just saw one the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest</font>

254
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,210
DDoS attack in history with din last

255
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,170
week right and so availability these

256
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,820
things are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become</font>

257
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oracle and making the right risk</font>

258
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,600
assessment being able to look at your

259
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,880
environment and say this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

260
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,920
right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS prevention</font>

261
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,810
in place and sewed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily could have</font>

262
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,029
been us these are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

263
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,800
recognize going along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys we</font>

264
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,689
have authenticity authorization

265
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,250
non-repudiation these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all things</font>

266
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,410
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it comes</font>

267
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,300
to application security and specifically

268
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,439
with respect to identify an application

269
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,240
security risks when it comes to

270
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,240
methodologies there's lots of different

271
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">methodologies out there we don't have to</font>

272
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,170
reinvent the wheel that's the good thing

273
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,489
the problem is we kind of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sift</font>

274
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,519
through these and<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what's</font>

275
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,010
right for us when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> first doing risk</font>

276
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,839
management I looked through a whole

277
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,329
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these I can't I can't honestly</font>

278
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,130
say that I've looked at all of these but

279
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,599
I ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up kind of selling on the NIST</font>

280
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,540
framework and the reason why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell down</font>

281
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">NIST was because NIST 830 was a very</font>

282
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,980
specific process for here's how you do

283
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,870
risk management it seemed fairly simple

284
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,269
as a huge document right almost 100

285
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,519
pages it was a huge document but was

286
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:22,410
like okay yeah plant you you submit your

287
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,850
risk you plan your mitigation you make

288
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,000
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody is reviewing this a</font>

289
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,800
regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was basically it</font>

290
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,600
there was a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff in</font>

291
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,399
there they use a lot of words but that

292
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,140
was that was in essence what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was doing</font>

293
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the cool thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about NIST is it's</font>

294
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,890
the federal government standard for risk

295
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,719
management so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it came down to it</font>

296
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,180
you know I could say I'm following the

297
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,560
NIST process and hey it's good enough

298
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,939
for the federal government's good enough

299
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,768
for all the state governments all the

300
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,230
local governments the military right

301
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:52,260
it's good enough for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so that's really</font>

302
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">where where I sell down that so you know</font>

303
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,490
when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to choosing which one you</font>

304
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,829
should use don't let the complexity

305
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,190
prevent you from starting right it's

306
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:04,050
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing something is going</font>

307
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better than nothing if you can get</font>

308
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,040
in there and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a couple</font>

309
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,269
wrists into the system then you at least

310
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,939
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting place for that</font>

311
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:13,740
prioritization process all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

312
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you look at all these different</font>

313
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,930
ones always always treat them as

314
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,040
guidelines not as examples the reason

315
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">being that if you treat them as</font>

316
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,060
guidelines it allows you to kind of

317
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,439
break outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those guidelines if you</font>

318
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,380
find that something doesn't fit you

319
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,390
exactly you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font>

320
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,340
them word for word

321
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,900
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know obviously we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

322
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,170
understand the basic concepts behind

323
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,689
them and use tools and tools was really

324
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:43,819
the area where I struggled when I first

325
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:46,100
got started<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I want to us to</font>

326
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,550
have a common<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding of all these</font>

327
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,820
terms and then another relationships

328
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:55,750
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use these later on okay</font>

329
00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:00,140
so the first thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

330
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:03,710
really identify and understand what is

331
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:08,560
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protect right so this</font>

332
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:11,840
week all asset okay as examples if you

333
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,959
depend on Oh at which level you're doing

334
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,850
a risk assessment it can be a server if

335
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,570
you consider a network it can be a

336
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,310
service for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you provide a</font>

337
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:25,550
payment service so that the service

338
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:29,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself is your i set it it could be</font>

339
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:32,449
theta in the for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the personal</font>

340
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,210
identifiable information PII that is an

341
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,790
etc so you first need to identify what

342
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,880
are the assets you want to protect and

343
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,579
then you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it who wants to</font>

344
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">damage or get these assets from you</font>

345
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,490
right so it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some hackers it</font>

346
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,620
could be competitors it could be

347
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,070
terrorists it could be many things or

348
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:58,400
even insiders so we call those thread

349
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,700
agent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we have a set the thread</font>

350
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,449
agent try to get our asset and then so

351
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:10,130
the thread agent trying to let in this

352
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:12,830
example try to steal our data so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

353
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:16,760
a threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we have thread agent</font>

354
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:19,910
try to in this case and steal the PII

355
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:24,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we have a thread and then or we</font>

356
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:27,260
think about data how does he do it right

357
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,790
and then we have comes to the term

358
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,500
vulnerability right so your system

359
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:36,650
regardless large or small right your

360
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:41,010
system may have vulnerabilities the

361
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:44,250
sweat agent will post the thread

362
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:47,939
will exploit your vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

363
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:50,820
so in this case if your data is not

364
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,790
encrypted in print<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hexter that is a</font>

365
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,320
vulnerability right even your insider in

366
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,290
the cat that ate hardly you can get the

367
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:02,570
data because it's not encrypted so then

368
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:07,620
we have a risk so the risk is a possible

369
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:10,020
PII strip<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swift theft ok so the</font>

370
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,210
relationship of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerability can</font>

371
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,660
lead to a risk the thread agent

372
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:20,910
basically exploit vulnerabilities this

373
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:22,439
pose a risk to the SF<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right so</font>

374
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,530
we need to go through our system to

375
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,310
identify these things once we identified

376
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:32,010
a bunch of list risks then what do we do

377
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:35,400
right and as Josh mentioned earlier you

378
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unlimited budget to fix all</font>

379
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,160
the risks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are facing and some of</font>

380
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,680
them you may be is very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix</font>

381
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,140
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing we want to do is we</font>

382
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,620
want to assess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk so we can</font>

383
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:53,040
prioritize what we want to do so one of

384
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,590
the there's different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evaluate</font>

385
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,079
that to give risk of score basically

386
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,810
there's different ways the classical

387
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,780
risk of formula is like this you

388
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:07,290
consider the likelihood which is the

389
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,359
possibility of some bad thing may occur

390
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,490
so it depends many things have this

391
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,369
occurred before have this occurred

392
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:19,380
inside your company before and how come

393
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:21,810
how difficult it is to up for the thread

394
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,449
agent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually explore this</font>

395
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:28,620
vulnerability you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider what is</font>

396
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:30,450
the reward<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the hacker Oh for the you</font>

397
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,790
know for your competitor to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if</font>

398
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,400
there's no reward if it's very high

399
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,360
complexity why does he do it right so

400
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">this all considered as part of the</font>

401
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,790
likelihood<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you want to consider</font>

402
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:48,200
the impact what what is the actual loss

403
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,550
which can be financial loss can be

404
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,299
replicating and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the et cetera what is</font>

405
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,779
the active

406
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:58,830
impact actually loss if this event

407
00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:02,070
indeed occurred right so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

408
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:04,499
you calculate the risk typically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

409
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,309
not a unique way this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way</font>

410
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:10,440
classic away typically you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will classify</font>

411
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:13,408
you give some numbers right between one

412
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,340
to four or whatever numbers so if the

413
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:20,309
likelihood is very very rarely it can

414
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,009
happen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact is very small then</font>

415
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:25,649
your risk is low right and if it

416
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:27,840
happened the likelihood is very much

417
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:30,119
like likely it's going to happen so this

418
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,980
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> axis you go to this end and the</font>

419
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:38,609
damage<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is is very very bad then you</font>

420
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:42,210
have very critical risk so and then

421
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:45,330
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other ways other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems so we</font>

422
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:50,519
will see it later for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> cbss is</font>

423
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:53,519
one of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> commonly used ways to</font>

424
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,940
score the vulnerability remember we say

425
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,440
vulnerability there's a difference of

426
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:03,269
vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus risk right remember</font>

427
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so CBS s is a way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to score</font>

428
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:09,239
they are vulnerability and then we have

429
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:12,480
dread let's say another way to score the

430
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:16,619
risk of course we have asthma risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

431
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:20,730
risk rating method which yeah we can see

432
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:23,428
later in the demo so there's different

433
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,519
ways then you want to decide which ways

434
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:28,980
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rate your risk you probably</font>

435
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:33,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do it consistently with within</font>

436
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:35,970
your system right let's see we have

437
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">identified the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk we also scored it</font>

438
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,730
how we know which which one is high risk

439
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:45,928
with low risk then what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we</font>

440
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:48,539
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage the risk ah so we always</font>

441
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell our technical people risk</font>

442
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">management is a business decision like</font>

443
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">Joshua's saying it gives the visibility</font>

444
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,080
to management right and that's your

445
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">based on your your you know business</font>

446
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">situations you decide which one you want</font>

447
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do which one you don't write and then</font>

448
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:08,530
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

449
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:11,230
clay there are four different ways to to

450
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,660
manage the risk these are for the

451
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,630
typical ways you can avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk</font>

452
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:20,140
right you come out some alternatives so

453
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:25,060
that the risk of do not does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not realize</font>

454
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,550
for example driving is risky right I can

455
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,040
decide I work from home so I don't drive

456
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,680
oh I take public transportation<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I</font>

457
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">ride my bicycle so that is avoidance</font>

458
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,330
right that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the strategy</font>

459
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,790
another strategy is transfer you

460
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,629
transfer your risk to somebody else a

461
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:46,210
typical situation again back to driving

462
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:48,820
driving is risky if somebody bumped into

463
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,130
me my car may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be damaged so I buy car</font>

464
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,950
insurance that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another way is</font>

465
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:57,130
transfer the risk and then it's

466
00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:00,570
mitigator you eliminate or significantly

467
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:03,820
significantly reduce the<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of risk</font>

468
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:06,939
for example get back to driving you put

469
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,159
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> seatbelt on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right that is a</font>

470
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,980
mitigation in case you have a car

471
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,920
accident you have some protections yeah

472
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,230
and another thing you just accept her do

473
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,930
nothing that is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strategy right</font>

474
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:23,440
driving is risky I'm still driving right

475
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:27,040
so you can have different strategies for

476
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,970
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the risk again this is a</font>

477
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,430
business decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so your</font>

478
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:36,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">business decision is basically like well</font>

479
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:39,030
part of it is based on the cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

480
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:42,910
benefit analysis right so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

481
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:47,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to mitigate a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> risk you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

482
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:49,270
add another<font color="#E5E5E5"> layers of firewall let's see</font>

483
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,250
you added another layers of waffle right

484
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:56,530
and then you will consider your<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

485
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:58,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a benefit yeah and then let's talk</font>

486
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:03,060
about the mitigation let's assume we

487
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:06,280
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided to mitigate the risk ok so</font>

488
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:08,230
we normally required mitigations or we

489
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,629
call controls or contour measures they

490
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,240
are all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same well same thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

491
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,950
different name it's basically a solution

492
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,140
put into place

493
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,140
that we can mitigate the risk for

494
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,450
example in target case they have very

495
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,820
weak authentication mechanisms they just

496
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,460
have username password and then you put

497
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a strong authentication multi-factor</font>

498
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,650
authentication is a way to mitigate the

499
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:36,490
risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have different</font>

500
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:38,680
types of mitigations controls it can be

501
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,890
administrative so that's where you have

502
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">laws you have regulations like a pci or</font>

503
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:48,010
those so that's administrative or you

504
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:51,129
can have a technical or logical risk of

505
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,900
logical control for example your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam</font>

506
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,960
firewall you add strong authentication

507
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,450
those are belong to technical or you can

508
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,480
have physical control for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

509
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:05,590
add you'll add a lock to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your door right</font>

510
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,210
that's a physical control now how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

511
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> relate it to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw</font>

512
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,010
earlier right so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thread agent</font>

513
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,379
want to explore our vulnerabilities

514
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:18,340
which produce the risk that threatens

515
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:21,640
our assets so control is here that

516
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:25,209
basically used to protect your your

517
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:30,130
asset and the risk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigated by the</font>

518
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,900
control so one of the things as I

519
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,490
mentioned before that i really struggled

520
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,430
with when i first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started doing risk</font>

521
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,840
management was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool set the very</font>

522
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried to do is I</font>

523
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,250
tried to use an Excel spreadsheet and

524
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,930
word documents linked by that Excel

525
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,030
spreadsheet in order to track all the

526
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk of my environment as you can</font>

527
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine like one risk cool works just</font>

528
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,890
fine to risk maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even 10 risk it was</font>

529
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:56,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine once i got upwards of there it was</font>

530
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,870
held to manage and so you know i had to

531
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">find something else my organization was</font>

532
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">running lowest notes at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time so I</font>

533
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,320
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool notes database let's try</font>

534
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,330
that one lowest notes databases work

535
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,919
pretty well I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

536
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">works about as well as like filemaker</font>

537
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,320
pro would work but every time I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

538
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:16,690
you have something changed in the system

539
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,580
or whatnot I had to go to a notes admin

540
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,530
and I had a it was six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months before I</font>

541
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,449
could get that changed made and then

542
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,920
ironically like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to change my</font>

543
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,560
wrist formula<font color="#E5E5E5"> Karen showed the</font>

544
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,060
likelihood times impact formula I was

545
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,230
like hey I wonder what would happen if i

546
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,120
did weighted likelihood

547
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,309
way it impact because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read something</font>

548
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,409
cool about them and I had them<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

549
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:37,389
the formula<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I had to reopen every</font>

550
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,690
single on my wrist and resave ever risk

551
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:43,690
to get the new calculation take place it

552
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:46,660
was incredibly frustrating so for me I

553
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:49,330
struggled really really big when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

554
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">first getting started and why i started</font>

555
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing i started looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at other tools</font>

556
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were like meant for this task and i</font>

557
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">found there were like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> archer and CA and</font>

558
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,710
all these other huge companies had these

559
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,630
tools with really complicated workflows

560
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,130
that took a full time employee just to

561
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,350
run it about half a million dollars to

562
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,690
buy it and I was dumb enough to actually

563
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,340
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to my VP and I was like you</font>

564
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,720
want risk management's getting costing a

565
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,280
half a million dollars in a full time

566
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,740
employee you wanna<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what happened</font>

567
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">she laughed at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me right literally</font>

568
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,720
laughed at me and so it didn't make me

569
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,520
feel very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> but um you I went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

570
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,020
there I was like okay well you know

571
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe if she does want to pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

572
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,889
whole thing maybe I can get the legal

573
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,178
team and the trade compliance guys and

574
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,770
the health and safety guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font>

575
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:31,510
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> a room we'll give them the</font>

576
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,070
whole risk management dog and pony show

577
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,440
and we'll show him what it's all about

578
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,990
and then they'll want chip in and pay

579
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,630
for it too so I come all<font color="#CCCCCC"> their we they</font>

580
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,250
saw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor left I was like so guys</font>

581
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,690
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think is pretty cool hum</font>

582
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,190
they're like yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome we</font>

583
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,380
could definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that it's like all</font>

584
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">right cool i need 50,000 from you 50,000</font>

585
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,049
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you're like wait you want us to</font>

586
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,390
pay for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> no ok so back to the</font>

587
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:58,600
drawing board this was about four years

588
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago or so and finally I was like look I</font>

589
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,399
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford this big tool over here</font>

590
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:05,559
these ones suck you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like I'm</font>

591
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,030
gonna I'm gonna put myself to work and

592
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:08,980
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to write something and so</font>

593
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,510
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i did i started with these</font>

594
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,160
values i was like i need<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

595
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,600
that's going track risk that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

596
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,250
allow me a plan mitigations for those

597
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,620
risks and that's going to enforce some

598
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,820
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a review cycle I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

599
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,918
that had the flexibility of a

600
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,570
spreadsheet but would scale to hundreds

601
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,400
if not thousands of risks in my

602
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,290
environment I need something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

603
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,480
allow us to focus on managing the risk

604
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,379
rather than hiring an employee to manage

605
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,690
a tool to do it and so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I</font>

606
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">ended up writing simple risk and in you</font>

607
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,960
won't forget that name because if you

608
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at your bag it's got the logo on</font>

609
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,360
there so you'll take that home with you

610
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,939
but the end result of it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

611
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,439
it's open source it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mozilla public</font>

613
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,390
literally take it and resell it today if

614
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,830
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that it's got multiple</font>

615
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,480
different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy it</font>

616
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,740
today we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to play with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hosted</font>

617
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,680
version that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as easily</font>

618
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,660
deploy virtual appliance for free in

619
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,430
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment or take a tarball and</font>

620
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,980
install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on your own server so don't</font>

621
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:07,110
worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about any of that in any case</font>

622
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:11,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's get back here so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

623
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:13,139
target earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> right target is a is a</font>

624
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,399
prime example of a company that really

625
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,010
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a better risk</font>

626
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,750
assessment so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at</font>

627
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:21,930
specifically the example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we gave</font>

628
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,510
Ryan in this case the risk that we're

629
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,160
really looking at is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're secure</font>

630
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,990
systems their environment could be

631
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,600
compromised through the fifth of

632
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,920
supplier credentials so let's do this

633
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,129
i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put my little microphone</font>

634
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,630
here to the side and we're going to

635
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:40,290
minimize that a little bit hopefully you

636
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:43,110
can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear me be like a rapper using</font>

637
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:46,590
my hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whatnot and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

638
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,389
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simplest i spun up a system you</font>

639
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,939
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to log into the system</font>

640
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,640
in just a second but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

641
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,010
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and login I've got the the leet</font>

642
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,030
admin privileges here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

643
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">risks right and as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier I</font>

644
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted a system that was going to be</font>

645
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,719
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to submit risks plant mitigation</font>

646
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,550
perform reviews and then create a

647
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,080
cyclical process where I can do that so

648
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,720
everything there should be immediately

649
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,810
obvious to you so in this case I mean

650
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to pull this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guide down a</font>

651
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:21,860
little bit exit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the full screen to do</font>

652
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:25,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we decide that our risk is</font>

653
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:31,010
secure systems secure systems

654
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:34,620
compromised through theft of supplier

655
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:36,180
credentials and Karen made a really good

656
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,949
point earlier when<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was talking about</font>

657
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this that there is a key difference</font>

658
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:43,650
between a vulnerability and a risk when

659
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:46,909
we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this earlier you know the</font>

660
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:50,400
vulnerability might be that the that the

661
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:53,370
HVAC vendor wasn't using multi-factor

662
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,530
authentication or that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

663
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,070
was able to get in through phishing

664
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,870
attack

665
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,700
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not really</font>

666
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,830
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at here what we're</font>

667
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the actual risk</font>

668
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,970
involved here and so once we've entered

669
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject of the wrist we've got that</font>

670
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,970
we can give it a category in this case

671
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,440
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably like a third party</font>

672
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,910
management that seems pretty legit we

673
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,310
can give a location so we're going to

674
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,140
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the target data center if we</font>

675
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,060
have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of control regulation or</font>

676
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,010
something like that you know maybe it's

677
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,080
PCI DSS or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that we can</font>

678
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,879
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in there Karen talked a little</font>

679
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,030
bit about assets you know maybe this

680
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,530
asset is you know some server will put

681
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in there we can give it a</font>

682
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,550
technology if there's a certain

683
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,800
technology that's that involves it we

684
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,270
can give it a team we can tell you know

685
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,790
who's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to own this who their</font>

686
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,889
manager is and so we can basically go

687
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,840
through and do all that the next piece

688
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,980
once we have our risk in the system I

689
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,199
let's give it a source to this is a

690
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,240
external the next piece is scoring that

691
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk so in this case we have a risk</font>

692
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,240
scoring method and we've got multiple

693
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,669
things these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all the things that</font>

694
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Karen mentioned to us already classic</font>

695
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,320
scoring cvss dread wasps custom and the

696
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,270
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind this was we could take</font>

697
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,280
any of those put them on the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0</font>

698
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,620
through 10 scale and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use them</font>

699
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,270
interchangeably so in this case let's

700
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use classic risk since that's the</font>

701
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:17,250
easiest but we could just as easily said

702
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,590
cvss and scored it using the CBS s

703
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,970
scoring methodology in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case let's</font>

704
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,760
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the likelihood of something like</font>

705
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:26,130
this happening is credible the impact

706
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,860
would probably be pretty major will say

707
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:31,320
that extreme<font color="#E5E5E5"> casts traffic in my opinion</font>

708
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,090
is like people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> dying buildings are</font>

709
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,730
collapsing things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's like</font>

710
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad right and then once we do</font>

711
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,230
that we can give their assessment we can

712
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,360
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> some notes if we want to we can't</font>

713
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,310
attach files do whatever and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

714
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,050
that we can submit the risk and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

715
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,750
risk is in the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

716
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:50,399
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say show me risk 1001 and it'll</font>

717
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,350
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information about that risk</font>

718
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and based on the information that we've</font>

719
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,040
put in the likelihood<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact it</font>

720
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,290
gives us that risk score and we can see

721
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,240
all the information there now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

722
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:02,070
we can go and plan a me again<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

723
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,170
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what'd you guys think what would be</font>

724
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mitigation for secure systems</font>

725
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:08,070
compromised through Seth<font color="#CCCCCC"> EFT of</font>

726
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,840
credentials

727
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,149
this is where we start getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> larkin</font>

728
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,830
this is like LARPing baby steps so if we

729
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't even answer this question man we</font>

730
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,379
got no hope for the next one right

731
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,330
multi-factor authentication perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

732
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,620
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that answer from you Claire thank</font>

733
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:28,020
you all right yes yeah clear clear

734
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:30,149
multi-factor authentication absolutely

735
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,770
so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in here and we say all right</font>

736
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,470
let's plan a mitigation for this guy

737
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">right we can go here it tells us no</font>

738
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,600
mitigation is planned yet our strategy

739
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">here would be to mitigate our effort</font>

740
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,830
with that that's pretty considerable

741
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,470
when she say Claire is significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

742
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so we'll say it's significant what</font>

743
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:53,700
do you think for<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost you've done a lot</font>

744
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of research in this area 400 to 500</font>

745
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,710
thousand all right so by default our

746
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,780
mitigation owner is going to be our for

747
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:03,780
the risk we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our team</font>

748
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:09,060
on this who do you normally see own in

749
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:11,460
that in IT will put IT systems

750
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:14,879
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so then we can we can</font>

751
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:17,910
say our solution is so we have no

752
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,020
current solution none today our

753
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,810
requirements are going to be

754
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,430
multi-factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication we won't</font>

755
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,110
have any recommendations for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this when</font>

756
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,910
we're all done we say submit mitigation

757
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,040
right and now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have our mitigation</font>

758
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:31,320
there we can see that that disappeared

759
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,050
from here now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step once we have</font>

760
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,909
our mitigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a risk planned would</font>

761
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,230
be for somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> and management remember</font>

762
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,480
Karen said that this is a business

763
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,430
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's somebody from management</font>

764
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,140
to go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and do a management review</font>

765
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,490
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go in there going to</font>

766
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,590
look at the wrist right they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

767
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,840
see oh here's the details of the risk

768
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,669
there's the mitigation yeah it's going

769
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cost a lot of money but I guess we'll</font>

770
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,550
spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> some money on that so they're</font>

771
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,560
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrist they're gonna</font>

772
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,870
say my next step is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to configure this</font>

773
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:02,490
for a project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they might say you</font>

774
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:05,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">know have as much money as you need</font>

775
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:07,800
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys get that right ever</font>

776
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,960
that's totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> the response I get from</font>

777
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,030
my management and now now we've got our

778
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,560
risk in there so when we go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

779
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,810
our regular reviews we can see the

780
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,460
information about that risk we see how

781
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,110
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> days it's open when the next time</font>

782
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,790
it's supposed to be reviewed all that

783
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,600
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that information is</font>

784
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,428
configurable with

785
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,740
in this system so this gives us the

786
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:27,630
ability really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily sameera risk</font>

787
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,929
planner mitigation perform<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reviews</font>

788
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:34,110
just like Miss taught us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

789
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:36,419
so now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done that now we get</font>

790
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to move into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> larping right and so with</font>

791
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:43,110
this here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to do you</font>

792
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:45,950
guys are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be summing our risk so</font>

793
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:48,570
you can see here I've created some names

794
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,610
username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password Alice Alice Bob</font>

795
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,110
Bob Charlie Charlie<font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel Daniel Edward</font>

796
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,928
Edward hopefully you guys can remember

797
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:58,408
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's ABCDE you guys know</font>

798
00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:00,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that right learn alphabet ok so here's</font>

799
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:01,980
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do karen is going to</font>

800
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,860
be our risk manager so she's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

801
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,210
kind of guide us along this exercise and

802
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,449
the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool thing about this is</font>

803
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,460
before what three days ago Karen had

804
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:13,379
never logged<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sim porous before so</font>

805
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,879
this for her this is a totally new

806
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:17,250
experience kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing this risk</font>

807
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,540
management piece you guys are going to

808
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">be our volunteers so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

809
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,379
couple of actors to kind of act out the

810
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,790
scenario and then you guys are also

811
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:26,219
going to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones to main the wrist</font>

812
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:28,529
so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> log-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last conducts imports</font>

813
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,239
calm that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS right you can enter</font>

814
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:33,780
the username<font color="#CCCCCC"> and password any of those</font>

815
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,770
pick your favorite one whatever and what

816
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,290
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do is we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

817
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">through this exercise so rules here this</font>

818
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,560
is totally uncharted territory i

819
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,600
mentioned that earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have never seen</font>

820
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody do LARPing before a security</font>

821
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,668
conference so it could go very right or

822
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,550
could go very wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm hoping very</font>

823
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:53,069
right right in any case don't take

824
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,389
things too seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody here is</font>

825
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to make fun of you but we're all</font>

826
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:58,920
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to laugh together so there will be</font>

827
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,960
laughing no<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching that's where that</font>

828
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,369
leads to lawsuits and sexual harassment

829
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,380
and things like that we don't want to go

830
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:06,900
there but over all right we want to have

831
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,400
fun so here's what I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have our</font>

832
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,350
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario is going to be a physical</font>

833
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,710
security scenario and I need two

834
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:15,890
volunteers come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right we've got</font>

835
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Claire I need one more all right</font>

836
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,879
absolutely so here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

837
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:23,340
do this is going to be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome I</font>

838
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,660
have two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can stand up</font>

839
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:29,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right all right</font>

843
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:40,890
what we're going to do so I am going to

844
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,779
read the script and you guys are going

845
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to act this out and this is perfect</font>

846
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,220
because the script actually has a guy

847
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,859
and a girl in this so in this case Boyd

848
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:54,629
you are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing Wendell</font>

go to risk management submit risk

893
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,700
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just clicking risk management</font>

894
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,740
will automatically take you there give

895

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary is the subject</font>

898
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:03,660
everything else can be technically left

899
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,919
blank give some thought to the subject

900
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,410
to remember this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

901
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,600
vulnerability this is a risk so let's

902
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about that one you don't have to</font>

904
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:22,230

<font color="#CCCCCC">working so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far good job guys</font>

913
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:15,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright let's give it another will say a</font>

914
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:16,250
minute yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get full so we're one</font>

915
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,050
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're noticing up</font>

916
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,030
here is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not filling</font>

917
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,380
out any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the likelihood impact</font>

918
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,350
anything like that doing the risk

919
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:28,130
calculation by default it's giving us a

920
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:30,049
score of 10 so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine if you want</font>

921
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you absolutely could change that and</font>

922
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,440
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go in here and change it</font>

923
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,600
to that might be part of what our risk

924
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,220
manager is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do do you want to</font>

925
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:44,509
pick one of those two to actually work

926
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:49,899
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay grab one all right so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

927
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:53,170
of yep

928
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:55,540
so let's move this over a little bit and

929
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have viewers scoring details</font>

930
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:03,490
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to update our classic score</font>

931
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:06,819
so Karen decide that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1003 was was one</font>

932
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:11,049
she wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the score on just</font>

933
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:14,740
take yep update<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright our risk manager</font>

934
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:18,820
has changed the score on one of them so

935
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:21,459
let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to reporting and</font>

936
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:24,490
looks let's look at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Idris by day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

937
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,410
so now who somebody even performed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

938
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:30,490
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that I had done right yep</font>

939
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:32,410
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all right so i went into</font>

940
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,790
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> smid risk by date rapport and what</font>

941
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,259
this is going to do is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

942
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">show us all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the risks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emitted into the</font>

943
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:40,090
system here ordered basically by the day

944
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,419
in the risk score so we can see all that

945
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:46,600
information in there do you want to

946
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:52,660
which one of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like I like 1000 to</font>

947
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:56,770
that that's my favorite hit back and

948
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">1000 to that was good on-site lunch man</font>

949
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,940
you got some made some some good ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

950
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so we've got our risks missions</font>

951
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,500
at this point so let's read the rest of

952
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,480
our scenario what Wendell didn't know is

953
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,580
that woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> was using social engineering</font>

954
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,160
to give to hold the door for her so she

955
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,900
wouldn't need a badge to get in when she

956
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,490
disappeared down the hallway she found a

957
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,380
conference room<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugged into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

958
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,600
and stole the company's top secret

959
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:27,700
next-generation widget designs way to go

960
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:31,450
all right yep yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so so now now we</font>

961
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:36,399
have a risk yep Karen's going to plan

962
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:38,410
the mitigation oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's pick</font>

963
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of these tallying all the beer could</font>

964
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:43,210
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen man that would be bad we have</font>

965
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:47,680
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> who try to cross site scripting</font>

966
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:50,170
attack good job like that simplest

967
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,700
validates all outputs or does HTML and

968
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:57,700
going on the outputs we prevent the

969
00:41:51,700 --> 00:42:01,259
cross-site scripting I would expect no

970
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,259
less from a bunch of security people

971
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Karen is adding the</font>

972
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:07,690
mitigation I feel like the play-by-play

973
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,759
announcers me now she's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plan</font>

974
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:16,140
her strategy which strategy will she

975
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:16,140
choose she is going to choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> negate 400</font>

976
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:25,900
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> megan what you guys think how</font>

977
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:35,249
should we may get this how would mean

978
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:38,019
how would we make it tell game shaming

979
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:50,439
make sure he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a badge what do you</font>

980
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:56,859
think boy yeah use a guard ooh yeah no

981
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:59,309
tell game that's great and yeah yeah man

982
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:01,779
trap<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard that one that was great</font>

983
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:04,559
alright so we're entering multiple

984
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:04,559
requirements here

985
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:23,240
now that will end it absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey all</font>

986
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:25,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Karen Karen has gone in to risk</font>

987
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">1,000 to tell game by non-employee</font>

988
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:30,440
random strangers she has said that she's

989
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,900
going to mitigate this right now we

990
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:41,119
don't have an effort selected let's make

991
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:44,000
an effort is yeah yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

992
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,420
about a different type of control so we

993
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:51,650
have administrative so the training and

994
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:54,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> note a sign a sign this I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

995
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,990
all belong to administrative right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

996
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,910
have security guidelines that you you

997
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:01,729
should pay attention nobody follows you

998
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:06,049
right and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a man</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> strapped it's</font>

999
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:08,450
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a physical physical control yeah</font>

1000
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,610
and maybe we can have a like a

1001
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,830
monitoring system that can automatically

1002
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:15,380
shut the door and if it's your batch

1003
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:17,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's coming into that will some kind of</font>

1004
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,280
a logical control right so we can have

1005
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:22,460
different type of control for the seeker

1006
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,700
for one who put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I put</font>

1007
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,700
several suggestions that you made<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1008
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,950
so go click Save<font color="#CCCCCC"> there yet oh you that</font>

1009
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,629
made a cake not yet considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> how say</font>

1010
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:35,270
that robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah sounds</font>

1011
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,160
consuming you do you think it will cost

1012
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:39,770
that man traps probably pretty expensive

1013
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:46,750
let's go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> half a million dollars 40 k</font>

1014
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:46,750
i'll go here yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we can yeah</font>

1015
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:53,390
excellent go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and click Save</font>

1016
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:56,299
mitigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrench manage all right save</font>

1017
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:59,330
mitigation all right so that with that

1018
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:02,390
one one thing we've gone ahead we've

1019
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:04,430
assessed our risk good job guys we have

1020
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:07,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">submit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our risk into a risk management</font>

1021
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:10,190
system awesome and we have planned a

1022
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:11,419
mitigation in here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we would want</font>

1023
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,040
to go to our management we would say

1024
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,630
here's the risk here's the mitigation

1025
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we planned please go ahead and give</font>

1026
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,200
us the money for this here's the

1027
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,060
priority you know here's the risk score

1028
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,290
if this thing were to happen and we've

1029
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:26,090
all the information for

1030
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:30,890
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we use it looks yeah yes</font>

1031
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:32,510
sir so you can change the values in

1032
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:37,100
there so like if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add more</font>

1033
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:38,450
you know more locations or yet

1034
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:44,210
absolutely you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely do that</font>

1035
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:45,290
you yet yeah well let's let's skip the

1036
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:47,870
review because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running low on time</font>

1037
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:50,090
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1038
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,230
so we had a couple other scenarios but

1039
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,630
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to skip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for the sake of</font>

1040
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,450
time here's what we're going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1041
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:59,210
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to kind of sum up our</font>

1042
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:02,120
conclusion here right so when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

1043
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:04,310
to architecting a security program the

1044
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,109
takeaways for this thing you have to

1045
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a risk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where culture you have to</font>

1046
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,990
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are aware of the</font>

1047
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">risks in their environment that you're</font>

1048
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,709
you're giving people the opportunity to

1049
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,910
report those<font color="#CCCCCC"> risks to you that you're</font>

1050
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,680
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a system that they can</font>

1051
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,870
capture those written in my environment

1052
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,310
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one the IT employees has</font>

1053
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,080
the ability to submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> risks into our</font>

1054
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,460
database which means if they find an

1055
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,680
issue while they're working on project

1056
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,090
they submit they move on right so we

1057
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to create a risk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where culture</font>

1058
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:29,510
people are actively thinking about this

1059
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:31,759
we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a process for managing</font>

1060
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,950
our risk you use sim poorest don't use

1061
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,630
sim porous whatever you guys do you have

1062
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a process in place that says</font>

1063
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:39,170
here's the steps that you're supposed to

1064
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,430
take the whole goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the risk</font>

1065
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,590
management process is to drive

1066
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,120
visibility and accountability upwards we

1067
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,680
want our executives to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

1068
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in our environment because</font>

1069
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,310
that's how we get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fix those</font>

1070
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:52,160
things if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have</font>

1071
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:53,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate risk to the</font>

1072
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,830
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> stakeholders right because</font>

1073
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,990
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones with the purse strings</font>

1074
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,400
and we should always<font color="#CCCCCC"> be using risk as a</font>

1075
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,350
means of resource prioritization

1076
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,300
otherwise the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't know</font>

1077
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:04,250
where to spend the money so with that I

1078
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">think our time is up thank you all for</font>

1079
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,370
participating

1080
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,529
you
