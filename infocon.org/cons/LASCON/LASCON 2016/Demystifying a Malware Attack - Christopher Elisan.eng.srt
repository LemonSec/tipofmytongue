cup so today we're going to talk about

40
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:26,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">the news behind the scenes and the</font>

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:30,830
lessons learned the news so every day we

42
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:33,980
see things happening like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

43
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:37,490
ten years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago you would see outbreak</font>

44
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,070
here outbreak there and that recent

45
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,730
leads you'll see in the news companies

46
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:48,470
being hacked being compromised and

47
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:53,089
lately we would see IOT devices being

48
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,880
used for ddos attacks we see what is

49
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,590
being sensationalized by the media but

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,540
there's nothing wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that it's</font>

51
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:05,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually what makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us read those news</font>

52
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,760
articles but there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

53
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,959
behind it that it's really really

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,399
important for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

55
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">especially if you're curious about</font>

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
security if your student or just

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,000
starting out being a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security researcher</font>

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,260
it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> good to understand what's</font>

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,810
going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background so hopefully</font>

60
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">today I will get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impart some</font>

61
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:32,060
knowledge on what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the</font>

62
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:33,440
scenes and for you to find out what's

63
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the scenes there's so</font>

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,820
much research work that has gone into it

65
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:44,000
usually this is how exciting the work is

66
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:47,120
so I remember one time a reporter wanted

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,640
to interview me about what I do every

68
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,180
day in my job and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was the</font>

69
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:57,200
time when a new James Bond movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font>

70
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,450
out we're in they were tracking down a

71
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,018
hacker and there's this very big screen

72
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:05,329
and I think was kill or one of the

73
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,489
technical guys in James Bondy was moving

74
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff around and he was saying all these</font>

75
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:12,110
computers being half these computers

76
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:16,728
being hacked so I i think the reporter

77
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:18,739
had that idea that's what we do so he

78
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:20,570
came to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> door office he interviewed</font>

79
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,750
me and then he should he told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me can you</font>

80
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,930
show me<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you do stuff so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down I</font>

81
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,850
turned on my pcs and then turned on

82
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,070
another pc which has the source code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

83
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,100
another pc which has to the malware

84
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,419
running in it and he saw this and I told

85
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,910
him here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I do every day is</font>

86
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:40,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">just sit down look at bits and pieces</font>

87
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,740
look at the assembly code and if I get

88
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited I write it down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on paper and</font>

89
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:50,290
then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

90
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:51,969
so it was an eye-opener for him but now

91
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,060
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's totally different because</font>

92
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,810
of mr. robot even my kids now want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

93
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:05,110
become a researcher like me which is

94
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">good so when you research stuff in the</font>

95
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,240
background you<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out more than just</font>

96
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,250
what the matter is doing you find out

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that malware is just a tool unlike</font>

98
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,229
before during the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> days the malware</font>

99
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,990
is the big thing if you get infected by

100
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:22,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware you catch the malware that's it</font>

101
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,389
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the tool you can aptly</font>

102
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:29,280
recycle malware and it's not the main

103
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:32,350
thing anymore in an attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> camping and</font>

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,340
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about campaigns we all know</font>

105
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,949
there are two types you have the

106
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,080
opportunistic and we have targeted

107
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:43,389
attacks now opportunistic is what we

108
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,909
usually hear in the news like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a there's</font>

109
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:48,130
10 million infections of this malware or

110
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,919
there's a DDoS attack here there's a

111
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,889
DDoS attack there but what we seldom

112
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:58,479
hear are targeted attacks those attacks

113
00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:01,110
are geared towards roles in a company or

114
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,789
a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> person within a company</font>

115
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,370
that's why when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes to targeted</font>

116
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:09,159
attacks when I advise people or c-level

117
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,380
executives always talk to their family

118
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:15,880
members as well and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the person</font>

119
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:21,250
themselves like for an example let's say

120
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:24,190
we have CEO a and coa is here right now

121
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,849
in last con she's attending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conference</font>

122
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,130
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our kids tweeted out</font>

123
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:32,349
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey you know what my mom</font>

124
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,169
is somewhere in austin in this

125
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:38,530
conference that i have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so party</font>

126
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:41,830
at my house tonight so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm an</font>

127
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:44,229
attacker that's gold for me that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

128
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,639
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> information because what i can do</font>

129
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:50,500
is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that information</font>

130
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:53,260
and design a spear phishing attack

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,090
against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CEO I can send a CEO an</font>

132
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,270
email saying thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for attending</font>

which of course all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are they</font>

141
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,550
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a scam i</font>

142
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,830
would i'll just forward this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maya to</font>

143

<font color="#CCCCCC">my sock or tower security vendor</font>

144
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:29,080
security provider so they can

145
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,340
investigate this further but then but

146
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,669
the attackers would do is that they

147
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,289
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them a regular mail so</font>

148
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,120
that regular micholi people believe

149
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,620
regular mail more than email because

150
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's physical it's something they can</font>

151
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,310
touch that regular mail could contain a

152
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,810
certificate a really nice certificate

153
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,270
that says thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for attending this</font>

154
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,480
conference there's a USB stick inside it

155
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,070
plug<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into your computer you'll get to</font>

156
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,610
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures and videos of the</font>

157
00:07:54,070 --> 00:08:02,500
presentations and some people actually

158
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:04,840
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that which is sad and when I was</font>

159
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,110
living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in California there are lots of</font>

160
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,570
campaigns especially during concerts

161
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,390
were in if they know a c-level executive

162
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,280
is attending that concert because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

163
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:19,090
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> that c-level executive or that</font>

164
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,309
researchers social media or IT person

165
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,919
social media and then they know what

166
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:27,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person's going to attend this</font>

167
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,890
concert tonight a Drake concert and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

168
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,180
they would target that person they would

169
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,740
be in the entrance where that person

170
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,539
would come in or the exit where that

171
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,469
person would come out and then they

172
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,110
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> give out free CDs or USB sticks</font>

173
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,570
like thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for attending the concert</font>

174
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">no no if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the an ID that says</font>

175
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,820
concert staff and a concert shirt nobody

176
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,849
will verify that do you really work for

177
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,170
the for the band<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the venue we just</font>

178
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:58,890
take the free stuff they're giving away

179
00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:02,380
and most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get victimized by that</font>

180
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:07,020
but regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's an</font>

181
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,020
opportunistic or a targeted attack

182
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,100
everything is the same it's similar so

183
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,610
the infrastructure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> supports the</font>

184
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,130
attack

185
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,570
the people behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tab it's almost</font>

186
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same same same technology same roles</font>

187
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,950
like here it's hard to tell the

188
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:27,279
difference right but it's big bird or

189
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,690
Queen Elizabeth so what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

190
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind the scenes so the thing about</font>

191
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:39,100
researching malware now is you don't

192
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,709
only reverse malware and understand

193
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,570
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with the malware you</font>

194
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:46,899
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to research the infrastructure</font>

195
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,870
that's supporting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is the</font>

196
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:53,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">most common infrastructure that we see</font>

197
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,839
in our research so first thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

198
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,819
the deployment technology so a

199
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,220
deployment technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also known as</font>

200
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,810
an attack vector it could be an email

201
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:07,990
drive-by download site USB sticks or

202
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:11,229
anything any technology that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

203
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the malware from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacker to the</font>

204
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,660
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that would deliver the</font>

205
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,219
malware to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> target so usually a</font>

206
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,300
deployment technology would contain a

207
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:25,329
Mallory installer so a malware installer

208
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,670
it's a typical software installer so

209
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:30,910
that's why when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you when you run</font>

210
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,800
something it disappears on your desktop

211
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,810
or the peers it disappears in your

212
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,120
system chances are it's the malware it's

213
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,619
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mallu installer now there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font>

214
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of matter installer app leaders</font>

215
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:45,279
three types you have the dropper

216
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,279
downloader and the hybrid so a dropper

217
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,199
is a matter installer that contains the

218
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,589
malware itself it contains the malware

219
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:58,380
in it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually it's like three megs or</font>

220
00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:01,720
more in terms of size a malware

221
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:05,019
installer downloader it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only like 300</font>

222
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,810
kb<font color="#CCCCCC"> or even less because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it does is</font>

223
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:09,790
that it connects to the network domain

224
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,099
or network resource and then it

225
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,800
downloads the malware from there so it's

226
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,329
like it's like a typical software

227
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,849
installer and where malware is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

228
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:21,189
software anyway so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the features</font>

229
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you see in typical software chances</font>

230
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,499
are you'll see it in malware now the

231
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:30,868
hybrid it's a combination

232
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:33,609
so what it first does what it first

233
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:36,909
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is it checks for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> updates</font>

234
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:39,429
before installation and then if there

235
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:41,769
are no updates like let's say it

236
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:44,379
victimized a laptop and it's running

237
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:46,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">already and then that laptop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

238
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:47,799
connected to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so what it</font>

239
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,399
will do is that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will install the</font>

240
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:54,759
malware that that's contained in it so

241
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:57,069
that's what the hybrid does now the

242
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,799
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware installers is that</font>

243
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:03,189
it's being provided by a different group

244
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:06,519
of attackers usually they sell this they

245
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:09,848
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember the malware</font>

246
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:13,299
that was spread out during Christmas

247
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:16,059
holiday our malware installer is

248
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:18,069
responsible for that so if you want us

249
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:20,529
to deploy your malware or to install

250
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:23,968
<font color="#CCCCCC">your malware in the same way pay us the</font>

251
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:27,789
money and we'll take care of it for you

252
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:30,729
that's why there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this term in the</font>

253
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:33,069
industry first stage second stage third

254
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:34,869
stage of infection actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

255
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:37,419
stage is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the malware</font>

256
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:40,869
installer itself so if you just captured

257
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:42,579
the first stage chances are just

258
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:46,359
captured the matter installer you

259
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:50,019
haven't gotten the malware itself so

260
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:54,069
this one assuming this is a downloader

261
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:55,449
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would check first for updates in a</font>

262
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:57,878
network resource which is known as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

263
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:59,498
malware serving domain so a malware

264
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,720
serving domain it's a network resource

265
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:05,289
it could be a domain it could be an IP

266
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,470
that contains the updated malware file

267
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:10,259
and also other components of the malware

268
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,779
that's needed for the attack campaign

269
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:16,539
now if its present if it's there then it

270
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,919
will continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the installation so</font>

271
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:21,039
the thing about here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

272
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:24,909
attackers made all of this technologies

273
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:27,489
modular so that if somebody is able to

274
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:29,049
capture the matter installer and they

275
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:31,119
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their malware to be reversed</font>

276
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:33,069
they just cut the connection to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mat</font>

277
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:34,689
we're serving domain so there will be

278
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:37,389
reports of saying there's this outbreak

279
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:39,098
this is what it does but it's actually

280
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">just describing the Malheur install it's</font>

281
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:42,160
not describing the Mallory

282
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,750
cell because they've already cut

283
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,850
connection to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware serving domain</font>

284
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:51,250
so the researchers won't be able to get

285
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:53,620
any malware samples now let's say it's

286
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,340
there it has the updates so it would

287
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:01,090
continue installing the malware so when

288
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:05,140
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to installation before an</font>

289
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:07,390
infection there's only one file so when

290
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,310
you capture that<font color="#E5E5E5"> file you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can understand</font>

291
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,340
clearly what that malware does because

292
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,560
everything is in that file but most

293
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,780
infection nowadays it's composed of

294
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">different components</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

295
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,589
components even more so just capturing

296
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,170
one file will not tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the whole</font>

297
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:27,370
story and you will not really understand

298
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,380
what the matter it does so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

299
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">most common components you have the</font>

300
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,810
configuration file you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the attack</font>

301
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,660
component regeneration component rootkit

302
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,760
and then the bought a junt so the

303
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,699
configuration file this is how you

304
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,680
control the malware if it's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

305
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,730
DDoS attack you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> put all the</font>

306
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">targets there if it's used for banking</font>

307
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:54,700
banking information stealing you could

308
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,949
put the target banks there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

309
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,680
that you that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you control the</font>

310
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:03,340
matter itself now the attack component

311
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,500
that's the component that decides what

312
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,240
the malware is so if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

313
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,640
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ddos attack consider the d does</font>

314
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,800
routine if its information stealing you

315
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,560
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root in there if it's a trojan</font>

316
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:18,270
or a back door you'll see those

317
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,890
functionalities in that tight component

318
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:24,400
the regeneration component<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also call</font>

319
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:27,580
this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> horcrux component so if you're</font>

320
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,110
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harry Potter so I was in</font>

321
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,570
kindergarten when the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie came</font>

322
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,850
out so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like me growing up with</font>

323
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:38,650
harry potter so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of influence</font>

324
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:41,590
so regeneration component it's a set of

325
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:45,670
different files located in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer</font>

326
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:47,980
or in a target machine wherein it checks

327
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,349
for the presence of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> components if</font>

328
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,529
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there it tries to recreate it</font>

329
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,050
if it's located

330
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:57,579
in the machine itself but if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

331
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,839
there it connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mat we're</font>

332
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:01,199
serving domain and then tries to

333
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:06,189
download all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those components again</font>

334
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:08,349
this is why some people would say you

335
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:10,059
know what we captured the malware but

336
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,410
they only captured the attack component

337
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:14,469
they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what's going</font>

338
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,629
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they would say you know what</font>

339
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,360
we already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

340
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:21,550
let's deploy it but then the next day

341
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,410
they look at their logs and they're

342
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:26,680
saying there's still some information

343
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:29,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">going out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our machine that's because</font>

344
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,540
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed the solution for the</font>

345
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,459
attack component and then the

346
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,498
regeneration component saw that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

347
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,628
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore so it downloaded an update</font>

348
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:40,180
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mallory serving domain which is</font>

349
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:42,339
totally different from the attack

350
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,050
component that they got so later<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

351
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you how easy it is for them to</font>

352
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:50,740
create malware the rootkit component is

353
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">the component that hides the malware</font>

354
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:57,899
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system now if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Malheur is</font>

355
00:16:53,139 --> 00:17:00,370
designed to have a to be a backdoor or a

00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,170
pipe continuous presence or a foothold

357
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,419
in the system this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

358
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,299
component but if it's like a hit-and-run

359
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:08,770
attack so a hit-and-run attack sometimes

360
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,500
it just needs a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

361
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,780
your system sometimes the good

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,390
components not needed anymore and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

363
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,039
instances were in the malware is not

364
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:22,600

365
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:24,599
attack the bot agent the bought agent is

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that communicates it has the</font>

367
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:30,100
it's the module or the functionality

<font color="#CCCCCC">that communicates to the CNC and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mallory</font>

resource that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacker uses to</font>

371
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:41,830
control a target machine and from time

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to time the metal components he checks</font>

373
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:47,080
for updates and then if there are

374
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:53,740
updates it downloads it to the ER to the

375
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:56,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">target system so as I mentioned one of</font>

376
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,289
the most popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> network resource is the</font>

377
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:02,289
command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control it sends updates the</font>

378
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:04,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Malheur sends updates to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> channel</font>

379
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it also receives commands from the</font>

380
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,030
Kommandant

381
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:12,059
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're certain malware were</font>

382
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:14,250
in a there no configuration file it gets

383
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,200
commands directly from the commanded

384
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,750
control now the advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having a</font>

385
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:23,820
configuration file there is that if it's

386
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:26,520
offline it can still function and most

387
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:31,500
of the time if they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to target</font>

388
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,809
a c-level executive they understand that

389
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,000
laptops sometimes go offline especially

390
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,649
if that person is<font color="#E5E5E5"> traveling so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

391
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,559
malware that's presence in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

392
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,419
present in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in that system has to be</font>

393
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:49,230
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to function even if the laptop is</font>

394
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:51,679
offline and we also have another network

395
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,940
resource which is called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop zone</font>

396
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,160
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network resource that</font>

397
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:00,360
malware uses to drop stolen information

398
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,750
now in the early days of spyware you

399
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">just need a hard disk but then you have</font>

400
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,190
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical access to the computer</font>

401
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:11,760
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spy on your spouse</font>

402
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:16,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">your kids in the early days you just</font>

403
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:20,970
install spyware and I don't do that so

404
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:23,610
and so attackers understand that it

405
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:27,000
really doesn't make sense if you want to

406
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:30,360
remotely steal something from a target

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,770
PC there has to be a capability for them

408
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,379
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stolen data without</font>

409
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,549
physically accessing the target machine

410
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the first thing they thought of is a</font>

411
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">email so before they get emails of bits</font>

412
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,890
and pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data and then they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

413
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,860
recreate it on their own on their end

414
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,330
and then that's the stolen information

415
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:55,168
but then they realize it's easy to

416
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:57,540
detect so what they did is that they use

417
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:59,549
domains or I pieces as their drop zone

418
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,159
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more easier for them</font>

419
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:04,110
because they can have their own UI they

420
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,780
can recreate the stolen data very

421
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:10,949
quickly they can decrypt it it's very

422
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:13,230
easy for them so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common</font>

423
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:18,179
attack infrastructure when it comes to

424
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:19,440
malware to a to an attack campaign so if

425
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,809
you have security

426
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,240
vendors and you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to analyze</font>

427
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:25,529
malware for you and then they give it

428
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,470
back to you and say these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

429
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:30,450
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources that it connects to</font>

430
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:33,509
you should always ask them how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

431
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:36,570
network resources being used because

432
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:40,649
sometimes you see we always always<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

433
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,330
it connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cnc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cnc this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C&C</font>

434
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:45,120
that then they give you a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

435
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,289
domains and all that and sometimes

436
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,908
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really used for C&C</font>

437
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,000
sometimes they're used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mallory</font>

438
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:52,500
serving domains which is good because

439
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,269
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straight there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font>

440
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,610
all the files and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you could analyze</font>

441
00:20:54,269 --> 00:21:01,769
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the future malware that there</font>

442
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:03,779
they plan to deploy and when you're

443
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,759
infected or when you're under attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

444
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,429
somebody goes into your company and

445
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:12,090
incident response team we should always

446
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask them the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mallory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that attackers is</font>

447
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,259
it a single file or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> made up of</font>

448
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,669
different components<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's made up of</font>

449
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,029
different components<font color="#CCCCCC"> were you able to</font>

450
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,980
get all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those components and you also</font>

451
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,350
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask them how did it get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

452
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,039
system how was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it deployed was it</font>

453
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,709
through email<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course it's if you only</font>

454
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,529
have one component it's hard to answer

455
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:36,570
that question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why sometimes if</font>

456
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:39,419
there's a if there's a very popular

457
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:42,539
attack that happened and you hear it in

458
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:44,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the media sometimes it takes 36 months</font>

459
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,860
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the full report because</font>

460
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,529
that's how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> takes to reverse the</font>

461
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,240
malware and also to understand the

462
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:54,629
different components that's supporting

463
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,820
it now the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about this also is</font>

464
00:21:54,629 --> 00:22:01,230
that once you understand this you could

465
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,850
gear your solution towards stopping all

466
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,110
of this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have a solution</font>

467
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:09,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">that uh that makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure no stolen</font>

468
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:13,289
information is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of your company</font>

469
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:15,440
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that prevents malware from</font>

470
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:17,940
communicating to known CNC sites and

471
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,700
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that prevents malware from</font>

472
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:25,980
downloading something from unknown or

473
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:27,750
unverified<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites so of course with all</font>

474
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,649
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technology this will not work</font>

475
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:34,700
without people behind them<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have</font>

476
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:34,699
the attackers themselves

477
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:41,550
the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is a sponsor so the sponsor</font>

478
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:45,270
is the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pays for the</font>

479
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:47,940
service so it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a government a</font>

480
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,760
commercial organization noncommercial

481
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,930
organization any entity that has take on

482
00:22:50,760 --> 00:23:00,990
something so for example for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if</font>

483
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:03,030
russia wants to wants to influence an

484
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:06,270
election that's what they're saying the

485
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:09,450
media they could be called a sponsor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

486
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:12,629
then they hire a group of attackers to

487
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,070
get what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want and then once I have</font>

488
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,840
that information they can use it for

489
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:22,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever purpose they want and the</font>

490
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,110
usually a sponsor doesn't have contact

491
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,760
with other people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> own the</font>

492
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,340
technology of the of the attack

493
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,530
infrastructure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just described so</font>

494
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,110
there's a middleman which I call<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

495
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:38,070
crime boss so<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually he's the one who</font>

496
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,870
has access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the technical owners of</font>

497
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,060
the attack infrastructure it's like the

498
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,139
agent you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also be a sponsor</font>

499
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,700
especially if it's a

500
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,430
government-sponsored it's a

501
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,900
government-sponsored attack team that's

502
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,190
highly funded you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the</font>

503
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,600
crime boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the government itself</font>

504
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:59,510
that government itself controls

505
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:02,219
everything so the crime boss sets up

506
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:05,250
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middleman between the</font>

507
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">sponsor and the technology owners of the</font>

508
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,860
attack infrastructure so who are the

509
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,550
technology owners<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the malware</font>

510
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:21,600
writers so they create malware and they

511
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:23,490
also create DIY kits so before when they

512
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,639
deal with each other a malware writer

513
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:29,880
would write a specific malware for that

514
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,470
sponsor or for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that attack but then</font>

515
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,180
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some arrests and some of the</font>

516
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:40,070
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the investigation that's going</font>

517
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:43,020
on they<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn their lesson so they they</font>

518
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:46,290
have additional buffers when it comes to

519
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,129
contacting sponsors or the middleman the

520
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,019
crime boss

521
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:53,259
so instead of them writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically</font>

522
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:56,049
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware for that attack they're now</font>

523
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:59,409
making DIY kits and then they give you a

524
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:02,379
special key or special license that

525
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:05,559
would unlock a certain functionality in

526
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:08,320
that DIY kit now DIY kits are not new

527
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:10,450
they've been around for a long time so

528
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,490
the earliest one that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

529
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,730
vcl at it was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

530
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:19,659
fifteen-year-old kid way back late<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80s</font>

531
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:22,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">Early 90s but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the DIY</font>

532
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:26,379
kits it's just for fun they just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

533
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:29,619
show your technical capabilities so you

534
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:31,360
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> al crater I'll create a DIY</font>

535
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:34,689
kit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can create a malware even</font>

536
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,158
without knowledge of how to code but now

537
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:41,850
DIY kids nowadays it's much more

538
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,259
dangerous plus if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to buy it</font>

539
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,809
usually it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> four thousand seven</font>

540
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:52,659
thousand dollars a pop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business</font>

541
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:55,418
is so i would say robust the dirt

542
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're competing with each other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

543
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,080
most of them they have each other and

544
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:03,610
then once they have each other some of

545
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:07,539
them use drop boxes and other web

546
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:10,748
sharing applications once they have

547
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:14,289
somebody they will just post all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

548
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:16,360
their source code and then nobody will

549
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,980
buy that kid anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they would</font>

550
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,049
say you know what your source code<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

551
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,289
already out there researchers can

552
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:24,639
already nitpick what they what they need

553
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:27,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand in your source code so i</font>

554
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:29,279
won't buy it anymore so it's a

555
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:32,619
double-edged<font color="#CCCCCC"> sword because it helps us</font>

556
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:35,499
but then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> an aspiring malware</font>

557
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:37,720
author can just get that source code

558
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:41,440
improve on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that crate is on the i</font>

559
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">wike it and then sell it again so</font>

560
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,480
another technology provider is a

561
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:49,240
deployment provider so this one

562
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,080
specializes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution network so</font>

563
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">it also has 24 x seven support so this</font>

564
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,480
one it could usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's the one who</font>

565
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:00,169
owns the attack vector the email the dry

566
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,619
by USB sticks

567
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:07,129
and they're the ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> who decide who</font>

568
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:08,749
designs how to attract victims they

569
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:12,709
could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook they could use</font>

570
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:15,649
Twitter and all that they're the ones in

571
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:20,080
charge of deploying the malware to the

572
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:23,268
target and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the</font>

573
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,949
botnet master now the botnet master is

574
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:30,789
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that controls a whole botnet so</font>

575
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:35,769
the thing about botnet masters is that

576
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:39,470
if you're an attacker and you want

577
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:43,039
real-time status on your infection and

578
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,499
you don't have that capability you can

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to a bot master and say you know what</font>

580
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:50,269
I need that capability can you help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

581
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:53,869
and then the botnet master just say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

582
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:56,299
this bot agent just bake<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in inside</font>

583
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:58,249
your malware and it will communicate to

584
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,649
the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I control and then I</font>

585
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:02,179
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you credentials for that that</font>

586
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:07,369
you can log in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you can see</font>

587
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:09,710
what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and we also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

588
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:13,309
resilience provider this one it provides

589
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:15,919
cnc most of the network resources that

590
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:19,519
an attacker needs this guide provides it

591
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:23,289
and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand here</font>

592
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:27,799
is that it provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> bulletproof hosting</font>

593
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:30,470
so it means that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to take down</font>

594
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:32,210
because they really don't care like if

595
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,730
the servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are located here in the US</font>

596
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:38,169
they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily be arrested for</font>

597
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:41,659
hosting stolen data or a hosting malware

598
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:43,309
for the purpose of distributing it but

599
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:44,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">most of these servers are located in</font>

600
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:46,999
countries where in they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't</font>

601
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:49,519
care or don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules against it and</font>

602
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:52,730
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these owners they say it's like</font>

603
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,249
you know what you can use my server it

604
00:28:52,730 --> 00:29:00,739
just pay me money I really don't care

605
00:28:54,249 --> 00:29:05,119
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do with them and this is aptly</font>

606
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:07,730
why sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see we took down this</font>

607
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:11,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">cnc botnet we took them down it just</font>

608
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:12,679
took down<font color="#E5E5E5"> one domain or one server but</font>

609
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,080
actually it's very easy to pop up it

610
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,940
will pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> up again</font>

611
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,408
after a week or so and there's no more

612
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:27,109
heat or no more attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being is</font>

613
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:29,269
being given to that botnet and then we

614
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:31,299
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the botnet operator so the</font>

615
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:34,850
botnet operators like what I dis

616
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:38,059
described earlier worry if you just want

617
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:42,168
a slice of the botnet itself you get the

618
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:43,609
credentials and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would you</font>

619
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:46,220
could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> rent a slice of d of the</font>

620
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:48,590
botnet pie like let's say for example

621
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what there's this favorite kid</font>

622
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:56,259
that I really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contestant in the</font>

623
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:59,599
voice I want to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kid wins</font>

624
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:02,869
so if you're really really motivated you

625
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:05,330
can just get a slice of the botnet have

626
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:07,849
all of those machines vote and then all

627
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:11,928
of them would be counted or you could

628
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:15,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an ad a legitimate ad that you get</font>

629
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:16,700
paid one sent a click and then you could

630
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:20,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell this person you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what let's</font>

631
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:24,349
split it I have this ad if somebody

632
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:27,229
clicks on it I get one cent I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

633
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:30,950
1 million clicks and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we spit it so</font>

634
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:33,710
1 million one sent ten thousand dollars

635
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:37,129
or it could be easily two million clicks

636
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,279
3 million 4 million or if you just want

637
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:44,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">to attack somebody by adidas you can</font>

638
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:49,509
also do this now the way I<font color="#CCCCCC"> described</font>

639
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:52,849
them is how they operate individually

640
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:55,190
but if they're organized in a way when

641
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:56,779
all of them work together sometimes if

642
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:00,799
it's a big project and if it's a highly

643
00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:04,070
funded attack they would offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

644
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,649
services exclusively for that sponsor

645
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:10,519
and the most sponsors they would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

646
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:12,649
what I'll contract you for a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

647
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:17,840
give you this money don't do anything

648
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:21,139
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> just concentrate on this now you'll</font>

649
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:25,189
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they work in indifferent chat</font>

650
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:26,658
channels and underground the attacker

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,269
websites

652
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:31,489
but sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also see the them</font>

653
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:33,289
talking in basement so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are pages</font>

654
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,570
in pastebin wherein they communicate

655
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:38,179
they communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in plain sight some</font>

656
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,979
sometimes it's gibberish so they have

657
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:41,779
their own decryption code on what's

658
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:44,539
there then they decrypt it and then they

659
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:47,299
they read a message or for those that

660
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:48,679
are are starting out they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

669
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:17,090
different kinds of stuff in basement and

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money mules very</font>

671
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:23,899
common<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know what sometimes you</font>

672
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:28,549
can't blame them because the emails they

673
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:30,559
get and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites they visit it looks</font>

674
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:33,019
legit and there are people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

675
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,739
calling them to say hey we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in need of</font>

a finance manager<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's work from home if</font>

your schedule with your kids<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

679
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,899
need to process payments and then you

680
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:50,178
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep five ten percent if it's</font>

681
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:53,090
this big you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to keep fifteen percent</font>

682
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:57,369
and you can blame those people

683
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:59,629
especially they need the job so before

684
00:32:57,369 --> 00:33:01,999
when there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> investigation those</font>

685
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:04,668
people tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be arrested because</font>

686
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:07,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're part of the crime but law</font>

687
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:09,849
enforcement now understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

688
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:12,918
really their fault they're also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a victim</font>

689
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:15,259
so most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time they're they're not</font>

690
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,690
really put in jail they're just

691
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:21,609
interrogated they're asked how did you

692
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:25,129
come about becoming an employee for XYZ

693
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:28,129
company what techniques do they use so

694
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:32,168
the investigation now is more about

695
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:35,478
understanding how they got<font color="#CCCCCC"> do instead of</font>

696
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:39,809
people arresting them because they were

697
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the of a fraudulent</font>

698
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:51,309
operation so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common</font>

699
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:53,620
tools that attackers use DIY kits and

700
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:56,950
armoring tools so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

701
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,570
tools out there when it comes to malgor

702
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,400
technology but these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common</font>

703
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:03,580
especially when we're talking about

704
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:07,450
malware because we have to understand

705
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that malware is just a tool in an attack</font>

706
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,020
campaign unlike before it's the

707
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning and end of an attack now it's</font>

708
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,739
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool so if there's an existing</font>

709
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,100
malware out there that has the

710
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:19,689
functionality they need they just use

711
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,350
these tools to improve that malware

712
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:26,879
especially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> armoring tools so DIY</font>

713
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:30,819
kits most common ones use you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have</font>

714
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,509
spy I lots of more tools that are

715
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,320
happening that are available out there

716
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,179
sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to buy them for</font>

717
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,940
thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the tools</font>

718
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:46,480
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> custom made for a certain sponsor or</font>

719
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:51,280
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> spur a certain entity that has a stake</font>

720
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,859
on an attack campaign like I really like

721
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,950
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one because this one has that</font>

722
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:58,930
says are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> infected by spy I so it's</font>

723
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:00,910
really good because when you try this

724
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,680
one out if you're infected you try this

725
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,470
one out it actually detects it and

726
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,990
removes it so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

727
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,770
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution for spy I you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

728
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:18,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to reverse the malware itself we just</font>

729
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:20,710
need to reverse the DIY kits so before

730
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">but now it's a kid just you can just</font>

731
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:26,560
google it and there are some companies

732
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:29,530
that actually have budgets for this when

733
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,259
there's people monitoring what's going

734
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:34,840
on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then if there's a tool offering</font>

735
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:38,710
you snag it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you use it for</font>

736
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:41,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">research so this is why when somebody</font>

737
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:44,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked me if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go into reverse</font>

738
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,170
engineering what do i do I always tell

739
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:50,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">them not to spend too much time</font>

740
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:52,600
reversing individual samples but spend

741
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,240
most of your time reversing

742
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,759
I you I kids instead because it will

743
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,850
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> you understand more what the</font>

744
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,460
malware is plus you will not be duped

745
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,930
into saying the first generation of this

746
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,240
kit and the second generation of this

747
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,350
kit are totally different<font color="#E5E5E5"> family because</font>

748
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,830
most of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids when they produce</font>

749
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:14,410
malware it looks different<font color="#E5E5E5"> in form and</font>

750
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:17,950
in memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you are not familiar</font>

751
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:19,390
enough with the kids you might say you

752
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,359
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a totally different</font>

753
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:25,930
malware but when in fact it's just the

754
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:28,030
same so that's why when we see stats

755
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:33,580
that saying we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just found 100 million</font>

756
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:36,310
malware a year or 55,000 malware unique

757
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,950
malware samples a day those stats are

758
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:42,520
true but what's not being mentioned is

759
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:45,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so out of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 million or 100</font>

760
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:48,370
million malware samples at<font color="#CCCCCC"> UC a year how</font>

761
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:51,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">many are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those were made by kids or how</font>

762
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:55,299
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were made were custom made</font>

763
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:57,310
or like boutique malware so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

764
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,750
it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say but once you have an</font>

765
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,080
understanding of the kids you could say

766
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:06,520
you can improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> that report and say we</font>

767
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:09,819
saw 100 million samples last year and

768
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,820
those 100 million samples there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

769
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:17,260
kids that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for those 10</font>

770
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:18,520
million 100 million samples so if you're

771
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,730
a researcher you could say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

772
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,759
I could just concentrate my time

773
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:26,140
reversing those<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 kids instead of</font>

774
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:34,180
understanding those hundred million

775
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:35,680
malware samples oh the kids yeah and so

776
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,140
they have their own functionality and

777
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,970
how to build it so they could build

778
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,150
infinite amount of malware samples

779
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:45,040
because they use time as a key so as

780
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:49,750
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time exists it will create a</font>

781
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:54,580
unique malware sample now I'm standing

782
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:57,430
here and saying just reverse the DIY

783
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:00,730
kits but in reality it's easier said

784
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:03,220
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so it might take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you months</font>

785
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,869
the reverse one

786
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,810
even if you are really really

787
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:09,790
experienced and sometimes you need the

788
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,920
help of other researchers that's how

789
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,810
challenging this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if the matter of the</font>

790
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">crate is protected this is much more</font>

791
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:19,690
protected now you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a break</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

792
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:21,640
somebody releases the source code

793
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,950
because somebody releases the source

794
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,770
code you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> also understand there to</font>

795
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,569
protect the protection mechanisms that

796
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,910
they employ and chances are those same

797
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,590
protective mechanisms that you see in

798
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:35,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that source code it's being applied also</font>

799
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:42,220
by other DIY kits so it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> helps you a</font>

800
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:43,570
lot and we have armoring tools these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

801
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,149
the most common<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones some people just</font>

802
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">sell this ten dollars a pop five dollars</font>

803
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,869
a pop and there's people actually buying

804
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,609
buying them and sometimes they work

805
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:57,040
sometimes they don't work like for this

806
00:38:54,609 --> 00:39:01,150
one it has untied the debugger

807
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,070
capability compressed resources so when

808
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,960
you try them<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and you check all of</font>

809
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:07,660
those options<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you'd say you</font>

810
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,020
know what it didn't really compress any

811
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:13,750
of the resources or it didn't really

812
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypt anything just added garbage code</font>

813
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:20,470
but of course for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal buyer of</font>

814
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,150
these tools they really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check but</font>

815
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:25,419
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> if all of these works it's a</font>

816
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,920
big big challenge for the reverse

817
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,869
engineers and for the researchers to

818
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,760
understand the malware because before

819
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:34,150
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to the code of the malware you</font>

820
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,619
have to break the protective mechanisms

821
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:40,180
that's being employed in the malware so

822
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,770
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've mentioned before most of the</font>

823
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,009
attackers they're more concerned about

824
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,359
the functionality of the malware and

825
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,490
they just use tools to protect that

826
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware and then they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could deploy it in</font>

827
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:56,319
an attack again I had this talk I think

828
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:58,930
23 years ago I call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a green malware</font>

829
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,200
made from one hundred percent recycled

830
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:04,060
malware because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would come to me</font>

831
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say you know what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just found a</font>

832
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:09,759
very sophisticated malware it it

833
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:13,270
bypassed all of our security mechanisms

834
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,700
and when you spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> time on it you</font>

835
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,900
realize you know what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

836
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,529
new it's like five

837
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:22,510
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old they just just gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

838
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:24,360
some armoring tools that's why it was

839
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:27,420
able to bypass some of the security

840
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:30,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">projects that they have in their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

841
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,290
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a malware factor it's an</font>

842
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,100
automated system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will create</font>

843
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:37,990
malware for you this is in real time

844
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:42,370
this is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now live like</font>

845
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:45,339
from Atlanta so the thing here is that

846
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:47,500
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just leave this machine and this</font>

847
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,900
one I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use use since it's easier to</font>

848
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,030
deploy and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the lower</font>

849
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,060
right it would create the number of

850
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:58,330
malware samples so you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out watch</font>

851
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:01,180
a movie vote or do whatever you come

852
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:04,420
back you'll have hundreds of malware you

853
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,669
can go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a drink get arrested come</font>

854
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:11,650
back the next day you'll have 10,000

855
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:14,050
malware samples and when I say malware

856
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:17,610
samples it's unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way that it</font>

857
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:21,070
doesn't look it doesn't look similar

858
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,570
when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on disk and also</font>

859
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,430
when it's loaded in memory it looks

860
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,900
totally different so for the untrained

861
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,210
eye they would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say oh this is a new</font>

862
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,390
modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> family but in fact it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just it</font>

863
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:34,150
just came from one kid this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why it's</font>

864
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,920
easy for malware writers or for the

865
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,350
attackers to rotate mother in a machine

866
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">like they could have an infection there</font>

867
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:43,089
and then they would say now at every

868
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,740
hour let's update it let's update that

869
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:47,680
malware so if somebody goes into that

870
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">company gets that whole set of</font>

871
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,350
components deploy a solution two three

872
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:55,000
four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours later those malware that</font>

873
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:57,580
were analyzed they don't exist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

874
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,650
system anymore because the attackers

875
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,110
probably would have updated the mallard

876
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,970
components and the matter itself in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

877
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:07,510
system because they have all of these

878
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:10,029
malware samples in their hands that they

879
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:12,730
can use now if you're a small-time crook

880
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:14,320
you really you're not part of very of a

881
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:18,090
very sophisticated group you can just

882
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:21,610
sell each sample online for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cent</font>

883
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:23,200
like I can sell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique samples for</font>

884
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,390
one cent so if you could create 1

885
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,279
million one cent that's like 10 grand

886
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,109
for you and there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that buy</font>

887
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,960
them especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe disgruntled</font>

888
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:34,270
employees there

889
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,490
I'm resigning Mike from my company or I

890
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:39,130
know I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fired so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

891
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:41,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a bomb there in if they say if they</font>

892
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:44,530
ask me to stand up from my desk I just

893
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:46,690
execute it before they could yeah and

894
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:51,910
then it gets deployed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company's</font>

895
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:57,250
system so this one is the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but</font>

896
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:59,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one uses a an armoring tool so the</font>

897
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:02,050
arming tool itself it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also creates</font>

898
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:05,140
different generations of malware so

899
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:08,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine this you have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font>

900
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:12,430
malware from a DIY kit is sub subjected

901
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:16,060
to a ton armoring tool different arming

902
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:18,310
tools you have totally different malware

903
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:21,029
and it's it sadly messes things up even

904
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:25,170
if you have the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> sophisticated</font>

905
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:27,369
heuristics it will mess things up and

906
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is usually what's used for a</font>

907
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,660
recycling malware you just need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

908
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,369
one malware sample and then it can

909
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,230
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> different generations of it and</font>

910
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:36,490
then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different variations</font>

911
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,829
you could use different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of tools</font>

912
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:41,979
you can combine them now it's easy

913
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:44,650
because most of the targets<font color="#E5E5E5"> have lots of</font>

914
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:47,619
memory lots of computing power unlike

915
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:50,349
before during the dog days windows 95

916
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:53,200
windows 98 windows XP days we're in the

917
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:55,900
memory is not that large<font color="#E5E5E5"> mallory tends</font>

918
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,669
to hang that's why when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

919
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,890
historic the history of malware there

920
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,829
are lots of malware that in the name

921
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:05,589
itself you'll see damaged or you'll see

922
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:08,200
intended if you see damaged or intended

923
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:09,849
in the name of a malware it means those

924
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,589
are malware samples that don't run

925
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:14,140
anymore because probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> they take up</font>

926
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">too much memory or the or the tools</font>

927
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:20,250
itself messed up the functionality of

928
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:24,250
the matter that's not working<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore so</font>

929
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:27,040
lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned so we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

930
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:30,790
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture so if you want to</font>

931
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">research an attack campaign don't just</font>

932
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:35,829
concentrate on the matter itself you

933
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,009
also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to concentrate on the</font>

934
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:41,790
infrastructure so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to understand</font>

935
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:44,140
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different roles that required</font>

936
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,770
to support the infrastructure

937
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:50,740
because sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> their cases were in</font>

938
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:52,540
most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people there or most of the</font>

939
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:56,319
people behind the attack infrastructure

940
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:58,120
some of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just recycle things so</font>

941
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,210
if you understand one infrastructure

942
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,680
then you could say know what this attack

943
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:05,140
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing we could stop it the</font>

944
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,390
same way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's the same group</font>

945
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,129
of attackers or threat actors that did

946
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:15,009
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also need to understand the</font>

947
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:17,050
target and roles of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the people</font>

948
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,780
that's being attacked like c-level

949
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:23,260
executives researchers I<font color="#CCCCCC"> teesta IT staff</font>

950
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:25,300
they have access to tier1 networks now

951
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,640
nobody would attack a front<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk</font>

952
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,500
personnel because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know that the</font>

953
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,500
computer that the front desk uses

954
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,330
probably don't have access to tier1

955
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,500
network but if it does the first thing

956
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:40,000
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would attack is the front desk</font>

957
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:43,720
personnel and we collaborate it's hard

958
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,880
but we collaborate technical we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

959
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">research scientific approach knowledge</font>

960
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,550

961
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">with law enforcement officers we share</font>

962
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:59,170
evidence so that the mosa Leo's they

963
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:01,750
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> database of different attributes</font>

964
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:03,370
for threat actors so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes if we</font>

965
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide them evidence they would say you</font>

966
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,900
know what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the threat actor thats</font>

967
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,490
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and it gives us an</font>

968
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:14,350
understanding it also helps them in

969
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:17,200
their investigation and that's it so

970
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:21,220
again thank you buy my book great

971
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,200
holiday gift<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter Facebook the last</font>

972
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:26,799
time I updated it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a year</font>

973
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:30,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago but I love Facebook and LinkedIn if</font>

974
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,220
you want to link up so most of this

975
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:34,900
malware they use home users as their cnc

976
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:41,649
also and as their malware serving

977
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:45,940
domains yep so like for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us here I don't</font>

978
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:50,710
turn my pc off at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home it's always on</font>

979
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:53,200
and there's there's a malware family I

980
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:56,530
forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they use home users as their</font>

981
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,970
C&C so there it rotate it so when you

982
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,470
analyze that Mallory<font color="#CCCCCC"> she you know</font>

983
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,060
but it connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's connecting two</font>

984
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:02,859
different IP addresses but then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

985
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:07,359
look at it hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

986
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:10,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">all IP addresses of customers from this</font>

987
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,970
from this service provider located in

988
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:15,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">austin and then the next day it's a</font>

989
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,759
totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> different group probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

990
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:25,930
located in<font color="#E5E5E5"> atlanta located in california</font>

991
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:28,150
so they rotate yep yep yep yep yep and

992
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:30,490
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to detect so those users</font>

993
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,900
they're used for C&C<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those users are</font>

994
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,848
the ones that connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mothership</font>

995
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,990
and the mothership is the one that's

996
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:40,030
located in countries elsewhere because

997
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,649
most home users they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

998
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,150
capability say you know what I want I

999
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:47,140
don't want to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the China or they</font>

1000
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:51,520
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to I mean China and onto</font>

1001
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,720
perfecto yeah exactly all right I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1002

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it thank you guys thank you for</font>

1003
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming</font>
