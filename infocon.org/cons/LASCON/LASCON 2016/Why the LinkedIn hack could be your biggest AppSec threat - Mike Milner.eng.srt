5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,920
and the secret about this talk is I'm

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,800
actually really not going to talk about

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LinkedIn hack at all it's really</font>

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how the LinkedIn hack affects</font>

every other website on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet I</font>

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,160
have some time at the end for questions

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,320
but if you guys have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions as we</font>

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,279
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> just shout it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and we'll</font>

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,820
answer don't be afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a little</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">informal poll of my own password manager</font>

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,360
the other day and I have about this is

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,890
an air quotes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 66 different</font>

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,090
stored for various sites across the

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet as i'm sure you guys all do and</font>

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,050
I kind of saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and thought</font>

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,290
that seems pretty high I should probably

22
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:21,140
be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some way of reducing or</font>

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,289
managing or single sign-on and all this

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff but actually it's quite low by the</font>

00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:32,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">average if you look us users can have a</font>

hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thirty different usernames</font>

clever a password manager if you're not

30
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:43,069
using password managers I encourage you

31
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:44,420
all to start right away because I don't

32
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:49,039
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you but I can't really</font>

35
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,140
counting on that they're counting on you

36
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,869
to choose weak passwords they're

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,959
counting on you to reuse your passwords

38
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:08,568
between sites so that when a big site

39
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:12,319
like linkedin has a big password

40
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:14,480
database dump they can go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

41
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,140
list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> find usernames and passwords</font>

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,299
that you used on linkedin and test them

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,790
on pretty much every<font color="#CCCCCC"> other site out</font>

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,870
there on the internet to find those ones

45
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,879
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've reused and there's lots of</font>

46
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">different reasons they're doing this but</font>

47
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,920
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of an attack that</font>

48
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think is interesting because your</font>

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">sites are becoming more vulnerable</font>

50
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:41,210
because of somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else's hack somebody</font>

51
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,770
else's breach<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's now affecting you</font>

52
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,080
even though you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done nothing</font>

53
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,330
wrong with your site you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have</font>

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,120
any vulnerabilities but now your site

55
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:55,690
has become more vulnerable because of a

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:59,440
breach at LinkedIn or or many others so

57
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:02,170
why our hackers interested in this stuff

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,600
these aren't accounts that control your

59
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,250
system access it's not your database

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,549
root password that lets them<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal your</font>

61
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:15,100
data it's not your SSH credentials these

62
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,100
are passwords of the users of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,570
but there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons</font>

64
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,770
why hackers might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into there</font>

65
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,320
one of the big ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably the</font>

66
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:28,130
original ones is financial fraud and

67
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,450
theft if an attacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get into one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your customers if you're an e-commerce</font>

then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they might be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just directly</font>

anything that equates closely to money

75
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,850
or high-value items is going to be an

76
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,250
immediate motivation for an attacker

77
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,400
there's an interesting variation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,160
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around the end of last year</font>

the attackers we're trying to breach

83
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,970

careful with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Fitbit password it's</font>

well probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not directly I'm pretty</font>

108
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,380
sure they<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through some way to not</font>

have the police show up at their door

110

but the attackers got these<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand-new</font>

access their account anymore so now

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,870
fitbit's got this double problem of

119
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,390

them out to the wrong people as I'm sure

123
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,599
everyone here knows attackers are pretty

124
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,919
adept at finding ways to convert

security vulnerabilities into cash money

126
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,790
another big one is any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of virtual</font>

127
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,380
currency and this could be things like

loyalty point system and what they were

147
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,210
doing is collecting these loyalty points

148
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,580
from breached accounts and they had

149
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,229
people who would work behind the front

159
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,320
they're stolen they kind of have a

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,729

days gaming finance is a multi-billion

that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of helped control the spread</font>

of spam but if an attacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start</font>

stealing accounts of existing users

these are a few actual tweets from

that as soon as something came on there

these are major news about passwords

SQL injection vulnerability well they

222
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,790
probably do but this isn't what the hack

223

is both they don't have these aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> XSS</font>

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,720
getting drawn into the the aftermath of

kind of hear about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot this year but</font>

234
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:02,180
it actually happened i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was 2014</font>

235
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:05,329
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fresh new data but by the</font>

238
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,080
it's old data so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time there's a</font>

239
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,910
breach there's new username and password

combinations being added to the

little bit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one credential</font>

263
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:26,149
problem that I explained earlier some

264
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:28,790
site has a big breach and now there's

265
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:30,889
lots of usernames and passwords floating

266
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,519
around on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the attacker</font>

267
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:37,569
simply gets the list and paste bin is a

268
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:41,809
great source it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary how many</font>

269
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:43,339
leaked dumps come out on a paste bin if

270
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:46,999
you're not aware of it there's a great

271
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:50,059
twitter account dump mon and it just

272
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:52,279
basically trawls paste bin and some

273
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:54,679
other sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> and any time it finds</font>

274
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:58,489
something that looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a credential</font>

275
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,049
dump it just tweets about it and a lot

276
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:05,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these get taken down pretty quickly</font>

277
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:08,389
because paste bin tries to reduce them

278
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,160
but this site kind of if you can spot

279
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,199
them right away you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take a look see</font>

280
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,360
what sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data is in there this is</font>

281
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,128
one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually faked for the</font>

anyone's real details here but you don't

284
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,009
have to look very hard to find some that

285

of use for these less important sites

well if one of those less important

297
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,129

<font color="#CCCCCC">lot more lately because of the</font>

really fixing itself it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

323
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:11,329
started with the adobe breach from 2013

324
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:13,819
and michael coats wrote a good blog and

325
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:17,839
i believe as far as i understand coin

326
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:21,769
the term credential stuffing and really

327
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,540
spot it identified that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

password dump they know what got leaked

330
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,870
and they can reset all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the passwords</font>

331
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:32,290
it's every other<font color="#E5E5E5"> site on the internet</font>

and that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case for every</font>

grabbed a screenshot and this is

336
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:48,920
actually already out of date on some of

337
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,860
the top ones and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only like the</font>

338
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,449
the first third of a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long page so</font>

339
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,720
check it out if you haven't seen it

340
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:59,839
there's many many and what it all adds

341
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,260
up to is billions of passwords out their

342
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,800
usernames and passwords that are

343
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:09,410
relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to access for attackers</font>

344
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they can then go and scan every site</font>

345
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:17,810
on the internet and and they do we've

346
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,550
seen huge attacks so many attempts to

347
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,099
log in that sometimes it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

affect the performance of website yes a

349
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,149
question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is is there a way</font>

350
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,760
to search like a username database of

351
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:31,070
who are these credentials can I find out

352
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,899
if one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them is me perhaps and that's</font>

353
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,820
exactly what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> website does you can</font>

354
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,310
go in you can register your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own email</font>

355
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,620
address or if you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and you</font>

356
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,290
verify your domain extension you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

357
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,649
register your<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole company so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

358
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:47,599
get notified if anyone from your

359
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:56,930
company's domain shows up on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

360
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:59,060
these lists I won't assert to anyone

361
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,540
that you should trust on the internet

362
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:08,178
but the way it's set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up is relatively</font>

363
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:09,859
good yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not one of those type in</font>

364
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:17,510
your username and<font color="#CCCCCC"> password and will tell</font>

365
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:20,178
you if it's been what's been breached in

366
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:23,150
my personal threat risk analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

367
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:25,100
figure that my email<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses in enough</font>

368
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,650
places that I don't mind putting it in

369
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,809
here if it means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i might get</font>

370
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,809
notified if if they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> my passwords</font>

371
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:35,660
in there but you each can manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

372
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:38,030
risk level of<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself yeah exactly so</font>

373
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,919
this site is very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about looking if</font>

374
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,889
your credentials are out there floating

375
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,720
around but<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll look later</font>

376
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,880
on in the presentation at some tools

377
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,240
that attackers are using for these types

378
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,870
of attacks and part of that is they

379
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have a community of sharing</font>

380
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:59,389
configurations for attacking websites so

381
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:01,910
these services that can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of look for</font>

382
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,929
your company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the dark web can</font>

383
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,240
also find things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

384
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:05,720
configurations for that yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right</font>

385
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,270
in

386
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,740
they do a email verification step where

387
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,810
they'll send you an email and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

388
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,000
to click on the link to verify that you

389
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,250
are actually that person the Ashley

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,790
Madison leak was a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for</font>

391
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">security people everywhere because it's</font>

392
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,290
one of those things that really hits

393
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,300
home I don't care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> my bank has to send</font>

394
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,180
me a new credit card it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> annoying but</font>

395
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:32,090
it's not a big deal they'll handle the

396
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:33,830
financial transaction loss but if if

397
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,110
your name is in the Ashley Madison dump

398
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,490
then that has bigger repercussions than

399
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,889
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a new credit card so that</font>

400
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:46,640
one definitely hit home for a lot of

401
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:48,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">people question in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the back so why is</font>

402
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,980
there no<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook I'm not responsible</font>

403
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the list I like I said this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

404
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,040
first third of the the page so it's it's

405
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:01,399
possible they might be just under our

406
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:09,889
two games accounts there or I'm not sure

407
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:15,290
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it could</font>

408
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:16,760
be a good sign but I don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

409
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:21,470
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would cost to have your name removed</font>

410
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:24,530
from the list but um check<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself to</font>

411
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,210
see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list probably</font>

412
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">most people in the room have facebook</font>

413
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:32,390
accounts as always<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say don't</font>

414
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:37,010
reuse your passwords and most

415
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:41,900
importantly don't be one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

416
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:44,270
here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was from a breach a little</font>

417
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,090
while ago and people have been doing

418
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">these sorts of analyses on breaches as</font>

419
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:53,870
they happen so that's kind of a positive

420
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">aspect of a big password dump is they</font>

421
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,889
can then look at the dump and you know

422
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,810
if they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got millions of accounts with</font>

423
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:04,310
passwords they can do an analysis and

424
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:05,990
say how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> are weak so this is a dump</font>

425
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:09,200
from a few years ago I've also read

426
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,090
information that in more<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent dumps</font>

427
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,970
this is actually improving which is

428
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:17,959
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome but yeah if you look I</font>

429
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:19,700
mean top two passwords make up five

430
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,919
percent of the total users on

431
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,720
that site that means for any user

432
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,649
account or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could get a big list</font>

433
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,450
of users chances<font color="#CCCCCC"> are five percent of</font>

434
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:32,090
them you'd get with just trying to

435
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:39,010
passwords if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of those</font>

436
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:39,010
passwords change them now right and

437
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:45,620
there are i guess i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say more</font>

438
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,200
traditional although password reuse is

439
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,729
also very traditional but lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

440
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,460
people this conference are talking about

441
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the very big coding level</font>

442
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,769
vulnerabilities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't focus on</font>

443
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:01,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in this talk but clearly if</font>

444
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:04,490
you're the one getting hacked then these

445
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are prime concern so don't be the</font>

446
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,830
source of these leaked password

447
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,289
databases so guard against this another

448
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:18,168
little fact from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the verizon data breach</font>

449
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:21,830
investigation report ninety-nine point

00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:25,399
nine percent of exploited

451
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:29,629
vulnerabilities were understood known

452
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:34,279
about published for over a year that's

453
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:36,500
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all of them so keep an eye</font>

454
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:41,690
on what vulnerabilities are out there

455
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,580
and patch them all the ones we've kind

456
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:47,000
of talked up to now all the techniques

457
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,980
have been attackers accessing your site

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,049
to either steal your credentials

459
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,600
directly or<font color="#E5E5E5"> test credentials from some</font>

460
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:56,029
other site but they're touching your web

461
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,939
presence so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance of</font>

462
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:01,730
stopping them<font color="#E5E5E5"> from gathering these</font>

463
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:05,120
credentials or verifying them but the

464
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,889
next ones are again nothing new but just

465
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,889
slightly different<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that it's kind of</font>

466
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:12,168
totally out of your control somebody

467
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:15,559
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook here you've got a</font>

468
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:17,210
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like facebook</font>

469
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:21,250
but obviously if you look a little bit

470
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:25,450
closer it's not these phishing scams

471
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:28,639
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty three percent of recipients</font>

472
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,010
open messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then eleven percent</font>

473
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:32,409
click on attachments no less so not even

474
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">just links</font>

475
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:36,100
again from the verizon data breach

476
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:40,780
investigation report this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

477
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:44,530
that's not going away and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

478
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:47,050
one that I like is don't i don't like

479
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,930
sorry malware that's actually going

480
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,870
after your password managers password

481
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:55,900
and this is old as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 2014</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

482
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,360
think so if you use a password manager

483
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,950
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be careful of your password</font>

484
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,969
manager as well because it's got all

485
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,620
your passwords so it's there's no

486
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,600
question that this is a hard problem to

487
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:11,889
be safe against and it's hard for

488
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:14,580
websites to to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> against so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

489
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:18,960
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go over now a couple ways of</font>

490
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,960
protecting yourselves from these attacks

491
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">and i'll go through each one of these</font>

492
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,139
but there's quite a few ways and you'll

493
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,970
see in some of the the bigger websites

494
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,520
they've implemented most of these and

495
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:36,870
because of this you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hear</font>

496
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,610
much about breaches on these sites or

497
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,040
problems with credential stuffing but

498
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to go through them all here</font>

499
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,330
first off strengthen your login process

500
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,879
on your site if you're hosting a website

501
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:52,389
make it possible to do multi-factor

502
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,760
authentication if it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-value site</font>

503
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,260
if you're a bank or financial

504
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,870
institution you might want to consider

505
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,330
making it mandatory for your customers

506
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,399
to use two-factor authentication it

507
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,310
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of different ways SMS</font>

508
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,490
verification as popular sites that also

509
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:13,840
have telephones like apps often use that

510
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a big fan of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TOTP tokens with</font>

511
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,159
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> baqi device or something like</font>

512
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:22,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the new you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> F standard that's</font>

513
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,510
supported by I think chrome and firefox

514
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,340
now but it makes it very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

515
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,740
like a little USB stick like this you

516
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,959
stick it in your computer when you log

517
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the website the little light just</font>

518
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,860
starts blinking and you just tap the

519
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,280
button and you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-factor</font>

520
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,560
authentication it's an open standard so

521
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,120
it's easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

522
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,399
whatever technique or method you choose

523
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,729
I just recommend choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and</font>

524
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:56,080
make it

525
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:58,900
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll take a dongle any day</font>

526
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,919
if it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it secure that is one of the</font>

527
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:06,550
big reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do like and can't really</font>

528
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,960
promote more the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u 2f standard one of</font>

529
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,540
the things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the most about it is</font>

530
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,390
it lets you use one dongle for many

531
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:16,540
different websites so today it's

532
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:21,760
supported on of the sites that I'm aware

533
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:24,760
of Gmail uses it Dropbox github so these

534
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,550
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all sites that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use fairly often</font>

535
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,920
and it makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really easy with</font>

536
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one dongle I can authenticate my</font>

537
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,170
two factor auth to all of these websites

538
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,820
and it's architected in such a way you

539
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,040
could do a whole other talk on just that

540
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,310
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's architected in such a way that</font>

541
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,250
it avoids a lot of common problems with

542
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:46,810
shared tokens of one site being able to

543
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,170
identify that you're a member of another

544
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,820
site or identifying that this account in

545
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,040
google is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same as this account in</font>

546
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,689
google they've organized it in such a

547
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that it's very resistant to those</font>

548
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:03,280
sorts of privacy implications of using a

549
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,800
shared token yes absolutely that the

550
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,780
phone apps are very good as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well if you</font>

551
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,909
trust your phone you've got google

552
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:15,149
authenticator is probably one of the big

553
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:17,650
common ones for<font color="#CCCCCC"> TOTP tokens there's also</font>

554
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:22,630
i'm not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do justice to listing</font>

555

them all but lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of apps like duo help</font>

558
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:37,150
other apps where they can coordinate all

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,360
this authentication on your phone again

560

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to recommend one over the</font>

562
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,780
creating a website provide at least one

option for multi-factor authentication

564

so that your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have</font>

long the passwords can be or care

don't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> step just let people pick</font>

strong passwords as well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next aspect</font>

570
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,030
is you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to prevent accounts</font>

of the world is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:19,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen some of this stuff can happen</font>

574
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:22,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely out of your control phishing</font>

575
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:26,080
attacks malware so have some kind of a

576
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan B approach where if you can</font>

577
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,260
identify an attack or<font color="#E5E5E5"> an account that</font>

578
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:35,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">you think is compromised what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

579
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:37,090
then if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

580
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,220
only identify your customers with a

581
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,070
username and a password and you think

582
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,710
that username and a password is

583
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,240
compromised how can you connect with

584
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">that customer and tell them to reset</font>

585
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,730
their password or block their account

586
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:54,250
until they reset their password have

587
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:57,880
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a plan B approach that you</font>

588
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:59,289
can take if you need to if some of your

589
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers show up in these leaked</font>

590
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:03,850
databases and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font>

591
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,650
doesn't have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy even if you've</font>

592
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,570
got a verified email address for this

594
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,460
reset flow there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of</font>

595
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:14,559
interesting techniques used by some

596
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,299
social networking sites I think Facebook

597
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,340
does or used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd</font>

598
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:21,100
show you some pictures and they'd say

599
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,350
who's this person and who's this person

600
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,668
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this person maybe</font>

601
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,668
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some details of your</font>

00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:31,059

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing data to verify but but</font>

604
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:37,080
have some method of dealing with these

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">things when they happen</font>

606
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,750
for the attacks where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using</font>

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:48,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">large volumes like these credential</font>

608
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:52,230
stuffing attacks brute force attacks the

609
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,789
attacker has to send a lot of login

610
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,580
attempts to your website they have to

611
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:59,520
try to login many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all those</font>

612
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:02,879
billions of breached passwords in hopes

613
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,700
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in 10,000 or one in a</font>

614
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,220
million one of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those ones will</font>

615
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,990
succeed and because of that they have to

616
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,490
try a lot of times so this automated

617
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,720
behavior it's not going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

618
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,490
typing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every one of these passwords</font>

619
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,049
it's going to be some sort of a bot or a

620
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:24,480
script so add in some support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

621
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:27,559
CAPTCHAs that's the standard tool for

622
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,080
stopping<font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS from accessing your site</font>

623
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:35,250
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rabat to bypass but easy</font>

624
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:38,309
annoying for a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you the usual</font>

625
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,320
balance is you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

626
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:43,440
show a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CAPTCHA to every single login to</font>

627
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,270
your site maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and you can</font>

628
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,520
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a fairly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy way to</font>

629
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,900
do it but most sites don't want to do

630
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because humans find them annoying</font>

631
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:55,049
and frustrating so the balancing act is

632
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:59,340
trying to be smart about showing the

633
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:01,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">CAPTCHA to some login requests but not</font>

634
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,720
showing it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> human login requests see</font>

635
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,149
some captures even as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully fledged</font>

636
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,929
human eye cannot solve them I don't know

637
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:12,030
if I'm just not human enough or maybe

638
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:15,539
there's around computers too much I

639
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know but yeah the Google recaptcha</font>

640
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:20,250
service is pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've probably</font>

641
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,960
all seen these often you just click<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

642
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:26,039
box and it turns green and you're good

643
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,960
to go sometimes it's not so sure about

644
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so it you pops up something where</font>

645
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,740
you have to I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know click on all</font>

646
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,299
the pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a truck or a flower or</font>

647
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,370
something I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the full details</font>

648
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,809
on how this is implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how it</font>

649
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,199
works in the background I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard lots</font>

650
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:43,230
of people who've either looked at it or

651
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,230
speculated on it but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it they</font>

652
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,580
say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser itself and I'll talk</font>

653
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,190
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about browser</font>

654
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,908
profiling in general but this is running

655
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,739
a bit of javascript in the browser

656
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:59,359
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript can do lots of stuff</font>

657
00:30:54,739 --> 00:31:02,090
and it can query api's that exists in

658
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,549
browsers and verify that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

659
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,709
back what they expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back some</font>

660
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:09,440
simple things like they're just looking

661
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:13,369
what's the screen resolution what's the

662
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,590
color depth what what plugins are

663
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:17,209
installed what's the user agent string

664
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,090
and it can gather up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

665
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this and send it off to Google</font>

666
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,918
Google you know verifies at all and send

667
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:28,220
it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say yeah that seems like a</font>

668
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:31,509
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've also heard people say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

669
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:33,649
uses a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other Google authentic</font>

670
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:36,289
authentication services like in the

671
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:38,869
background so if I'm logged<font color="#CCCCCC"> into my</font>

672
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:41,080
gmail account<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it knows that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've had</font>

673
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:43,369
that account<font color="#E5E5E5"> for I don't know five years</font>

674
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll say well it looks like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

675
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:48,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy who's logged into gmail and we know</font>

676
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:50,989
him he's trustworthy so probably he's

677
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:52,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay to solve this CAPTCHA again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

678
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:55,039
sure how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true or</font>

679
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:56,869
accurate but these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some things that</font>

680
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,549
I've heard as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I know it's a bit</font>

681
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:01,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">more than that happens in the background</font>

682
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:04,220
from just clicking the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do know</font>

683
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:08,950
yeah you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah use your camera</font>

684
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,950
you've got a good face honest looking

685
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:17,169
that's another question often traded off

686
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:23,570
thing between privacy versus security

687
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:27,519
dilemma so yes captcha good defense but

688
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:30,649
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to deploy it selectively</font>

689
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,590
so a common technique is rate limiting

690
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:37,158
because these attackers have to have a

691
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:40,879
huge volume of login attempts like

692
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:44,210
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sending a</font>

693
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:47,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of requests in a normal user on your</font>

694
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,789
site<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably well maybe they forget</font>

695
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:52,639
their password they try once they try

696
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:57,619
twice they try three times but probably

697
00:32:52,639 --> 00:33:01,219
not going to try 10,000 times or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

698
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:03,799
times so if you can add in a threshold

699
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,220
existen usually keyed off the IP address

700
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:09,499
the source of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

701
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:13,669
you can basically say if one IP address

702
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:16,970
fails to<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more than 10 times in an</font>

703
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:19,820
hour or a day you set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> that threshold</font>

704
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,049
if it exceeds that threshold that i'm

705
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,889
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start showing that IP address</font>

706
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:26,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the captcha if it's a company or</font>

707
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:29,238
school or some other place<font color="#E5E5E5"> where lots of</font>

708
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:31,820
people are sharing an IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address maybe</font>

709
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:34,489
you'll hit that limit unintentionally

710
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,989
like just from normal traffic but in the

711
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">worst case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario you're really just</font>

712
00:33:35,989 --> 00:33:39,649
showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a captcha so you're not</font>

713
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,169
actually blocking them from using the

714
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:44,840
site you're just raising the kind of

715
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:46,399
risk profile of that IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address to make</font>

716
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,519
them solve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> captcha before they proceed</font>

717
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,629
so you're good users still<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in but</font>

718
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe if it's a bot it gets stopped now</font>

719
00:33:53,629 --> 00:34:00,049
attackers aren't standing still through

720
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:01,609
all this they're they're testing your

721
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:03,590
site and they're noticing things like

722
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:06,678
rate limits so they're working at ways

723
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:11,179
around rate limits in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easiest</font>

724
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:13,280
way and this not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> for credential</font>

725
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:17,030
stuffing but it's been big<font color="#E5E5E5"> lately is is</font>

726
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,359
botnets so now instead of trying from

727
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:24,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">one IP address they're using your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DVRs</font>

728
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:27,199
and video cameras at home to now come at

729
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:31,250
this site from hundreds of thousands of

730
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:34,719
different IP addresses so now one IP

731
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:38,780
address might only send a login attempt

732
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:41,569
two or three times a<font color="#CCCCCC"> day well below your</font>

733
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,299
threshold for a normal user but the

734
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:47,259
attacker is able to leverage hundreds of

735
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:51,109
thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual IP addresses at</font>

736
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:53,000
relatively low cost so now your rate

737
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:55,369
limiting doesn't really work<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

738
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,030
they're still able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test you know</font>

739
00:34:55,369 --> 00:35:00,559
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> millions of passwords a day</font>

740
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,589
without triggering your rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit so</font>

741
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,690
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the CAPTCHA so</font>

742
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:10,849
that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know win one for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacker</font>

743
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:12,829
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next defense that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend is</font>

744
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:16,670
trying to leverage some threat

745
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:18,140
intelligence data from other sources so

746
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,880
if somebody's got a botnet of

747
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,618
compromised machines with

748
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,289
hundreds of thousands of unique IP

749
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,630
addresses chances are good that they're

750
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:29,690
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that botnet to attack</font>

751
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:32,539
your one website they're probably doing

752
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:35,000
a bunch of bad stuff with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and what's</font>

753
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:37,730
becoming very common these days is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

754
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,130
person who created<font color="#E5E5E5"> and manages the</font>

755
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:42,740
botnet actually just rents it out they

756
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,480
rent time on the botnet so those same IP

757
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,058
addresses might be doing credential

758
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,269
stuffing on other websites or they might

759
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:53,089
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing vulnerability scans or they</font>

760
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:56,359
might be knocking dime DNS off the

761
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:59,119
internet or what was the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent one</font>

762
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:01,069
actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deny all internet</font>

763
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,309
access to like an entire country<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

764
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:06,859
Libya they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for some reason</font>

765
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:10,269
knock them<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so these IP</font>

766
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:12,740
addresses are doing other bad stuff and

767
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:14,240
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites other sources on the</font>

768
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,430
internet will collect that data

769
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,740
aggregate it and publish it for you in

770
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,259
these threat intelligence feeds and

771
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,959
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of commercial ones and lots</font>

772
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:27,559
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source ones or free open data</font>

773
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,720
ones there's other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

774
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:31,640
signed not necessarily an indicator of

775
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,160
an attacker but maybe something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

776
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:37,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more wary</font>

777
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,828
about like tor exit nodes but collect

778
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:42,529
all this stuff together and use these IP

779
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:44,599
addresses to guide your<font color="#CCCCCC"> CAPTCHA serving</font>

780
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:47,119
so if somebody's on one of these lists

781
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,440
again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily need to</font>

782
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,890
block them but maybe serve them a

783
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,890
CAPTCHA oh yeah so do you see an attack

784
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:59,930
happening just based on the volume of

785
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:02,390
attempts and yeah absolutely and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

786
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,578
show any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of charts here but as part</font>

787
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,160
of your normal monitoring your security

788
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:08,960
monitoring you can be looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font>

789
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,538
stuff looking at the failed login

790
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,160
attempts and if you see a big spike

791
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:15,920
chances are good that you're under

792
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,109
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe your capture service is</font>

793
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,339
just as matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of saying I think I'm</font>

794
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:21,558
under attack so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

795
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:24,230
showing that to everyone but having that

796
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:28,369
a technique to selectively show the

797
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:30,650
captcha is whatever that technique is a

798
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:32,750
common<font color="#E5E5E5"> i touched on this one a little</font>

799
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,070
bit for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recaptcha when we were</font>

800
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,690
talking

801
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,360
about it but your browser's are very

802
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,400
complex pieces of software so if you can

803
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,950
put a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript in that</font>

804
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:45,300
browser and query a few of those api's

805
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:47,799
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned you could potentially</font>

806
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">dynamically decide as soon as a person</font>

807
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,550
loads your login form you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

808
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,710
little bit of JavaScript in their

809
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,990
browser and it's sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> something back</font>

810
00:37:53,710 --> 00:38:01,240
that says something seems a bit off here

811
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:02,950
show caption attackers are going to try

812
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,410
to emulate this so that they can fool

813
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,120
your detection and it kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eglise and</font>

814
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:11,529
again one of these cat-and-mouse games

815
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,450
but again you're trying to increase the

816
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,100
cost for an attacker making it a bit

817
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">more difficult so that they don't attack</font>

818
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,210
your site again the old you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

819
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the bear you just have to outrun</font>

820
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:24,040
the guy standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> next to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I just</font>

821
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:28,930
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly mention this tool I</font>

822
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:30,640
saw this at black hat this year this is

823
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:34,359
a really neat tool that uses the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL</font>

824
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:37,509
handshake negotiation to fingerprint

825
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,950
who's making the request and we've done

826
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,990
a little bit of research with this but

827
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,549
it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at telling the</font>

828
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,649
difference between a real browser and

829
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:47,020
something that's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pretend to be</font>

830
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">a browser so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really developed</font>

831
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,980
this much yet but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to throw it</font>

832
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,720
out there is really a shout out to leave

833
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,090
that this is a really awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool and</font>

834
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,439
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to doing a little</font>

835
00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:02,350
bit more with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but another way of</font>

836
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,850
identifying real browser vs this is a

837
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,380
passive approach which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

838
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:07,000
where it actually just uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

839
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,710
negotiation process you don't actually

840
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,980
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add anything to the browser</font>

841
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:15,250
itself we can talk more after as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well if</font>

842
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,140
you like and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing is</font>

843
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at your user accounts themselves</font>

844
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,500
so building up profiles you've probably

845
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,680
all seen things like this on google

846
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,230
facebook look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your users where</font>

847
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,089
they're logging in from if I always log

848
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:34,480
in from Montreal and I'm always using

849
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chrome on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OSX or an android phone just</font>

850
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,770
keep track of that somewhere and if I

851
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to log in and enough of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

852
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:44,680
is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe asked me to do a</font>

853
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,450
second authentication maybe ask me to do

854
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,549
my two factor auth even though I might

855
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:52,569
not have had to otherwise or verify the

856
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:54,450
account some other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

857
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to dive right into one tool that</font>

858
00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:01,629
attackers are using so this is sentry

859
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:03,700
mba the guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shape security did a</font>

860
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,950
blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> post that kind of gave a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

861
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an overview here i posted the link</font>

862
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,868
below but this is a tool developed by

863
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:13,570
attackers specifically for doing

864
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:16,030
credential stuffing and it automates a

865
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:18,550
lot of the attack techniques that I've

866
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,990
talked about here to bypass some of the

867
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:25,030
defensive techniques that have talked

868
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:27,368
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but it's basically you get</font>

869
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:29,260
three things and then it will attack

870
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:31,060
your site a configuration for that site

871
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mention their forms where</font>

872
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,410
attackers are actually sharing these

873
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,760
things here's one where they're

874
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,868
attacking you probably can't read it but

875
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,430
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix com so</font>

876
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:44,680
somebody will make a configuration file

877
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,868
that says go to this URL get this<font color="#CCCCCC"> cease</font>

878
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">or token then post the credentials here</font>

879
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:51,490
here are the field names here your rate

880
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,099
limits here your thresholds everything

881
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:56,410
you need to know to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> this attack then</font>

882
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:58,480
you get a list of dumped credentials and

883
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,390
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that from all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those places</font>

884
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned and then to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

885
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:06,400
botnet there you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get what they call</font>

886
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:08,680
a proxy file but basically a list of of

887
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,010
IP addresses that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

888
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:14,828
to use you put in those details click

889
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:17,400
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it starts going after Netflix</font>

890
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:20,079
or I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one here was a</font>

891
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">spotify streaming services seem to be</font>

892
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,859
popular so it's it's reached the realm

893
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:28,300
of literally anybody can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this there's</font>

894
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,759
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools that make it very very</font>

895
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:33,099
easy but are actually relatively

896
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,300
advanced so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can bypass some of the</font>

897
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,740
techniques that we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

898
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:41,190
not all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

899
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:44,379
the defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> in depth is important and</font>

900
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:47,710
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that sentry mba integrates</font>

901
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,180
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call out is even if</font>

902
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:51,220
you've got CAPTCHAs and you're showing

903
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,430
them in the right place there are now

904
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:57,160
services dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solving CAPTCHAs</font>

905
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:59,169
for you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe this one in</font>

906
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,808
particular uses a team of

907
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:06,460
of low-paid workers who basically

908
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:10,240
through the integration with a tool like

909
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:12,040
sentry mba the details sentry mba hits

910
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website grabs the captcha picture</font>

911
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,960
sends it to somebody in China or

912
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,779
wherever they solve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CAPTCHA result</font>

913
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,430
goes back solution goes back and

914
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,710
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do it all and i think</font>

915
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:25,328
around on their website they post the

916
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,710
average solution time but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

917
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:29,710
like eight seconds or something like

918
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,240
that and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an API you can</font>

919
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,329
integrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them you pay them with</font>

920
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin and you just add your API key</font>

921
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:40,839
into sentry mba and now it's bypassing

922
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:44,020
CAPTCHAs as well so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a constant</font>

923
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:45,549
battle here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again at least you're</font>

924
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,549
raising the cost they have to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

925
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:50,950
this now so it's a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

926
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:53,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">more expense on the side of the attacker</font>

927
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:55,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they wouldn't be paying otherwise</font>

928
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:58,420
so it's not like it's a hopeless game

929
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:01,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I've only got like very little time</font>

930
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:06,970
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I wanted to quickly talk about</font>

931
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:10,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">a tool that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together so it can</font>

932
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:12,759
take over WTF it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of shocking how</font>

933
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:13,930
easy this is so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw up a</font>

934
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">little this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of like an</font>

935
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:19,598
intentionally vulnerable website but

936
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:22,299
specifically for credential stuffing for

937
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,730
testing tools like sentry mba you need a

938
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:26,980
site that's preloaded with a bunch of

939
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:30,640
user accounts and you need a password

940
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:32,500
dump file that is big enough that it

941
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,348
kind of gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a realistic proportion</font>

942
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,599
of successful logins to failed logins so

943
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">really this website just kind of</font>

944
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,660
automates that now in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spirit of WTF</font>

945
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:48,280
it's not actually done yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm very</font>

946
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:50,618
sorry but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it'll</font>

947
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,859
be up there and you'll be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it</font>

948
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">at ato WTF and i'll put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up on github</font>

949
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:57,819
as well for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to deploy it on your own</font>

950
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:01,660
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want it's a relatively simple app</font>

951
00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:03,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you a quick quick</font>

952
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,348
quick demo on what it looks like and

953
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:08,069
you'll see why it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite ready yet</font>

954
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:10,510
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an idea all right</font>

955
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:13,150
so this is just a local deployment but

956
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:18,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously my design skills are amazing</font>

957
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:21,279
here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure HTML goodness but it's</font>

958
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:23,829
really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> automating you've got a</font>

959
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:26,020
protected resource on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site and if</font>

960
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:29,559
you try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font>

961
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:32,400
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there's a default user that</font>

962
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:36,099
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> test tests if you type in that</font>

963
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to log in yeah you logged</font>

964
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:41,430
in you can log out but the real thing

965
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:44,319
that I built it for the reason I'm

966
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,509
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it is just its ability to</font>

967
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,759
generate a sample a leaked credential

968
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:52,329
dump database so these are very long

969
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,279
passwords but it's set up so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

970
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:57,309
generates a list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a million or</font>

971
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:58,630
10 million credentials and the the

972
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:01,059
website that it's backed is

973
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:03,279
pre-configured that you know one in a

974
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:05,880
million of these will successfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font>

975
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:09,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">in so you can use this as your</font>

976
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,920
credential dump file for sentry mba and

977
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,319
we'll be posting a config file for

978
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,750
century<font color="#E5E5E5"> mba as well but you can point it</font>

979
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,779
at this website to play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

980
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:22,900
sentry mba and it's a platform for us

981
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:25,150
when we start adding things like putting

982
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a captcha so that we can experiment</font>

983
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:30,849
how sentry mba integrates with that

984
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,259
death by captcha service so that we can

985
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:35,109
learn a bit more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how these</font>

986
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:37,809
attacker tools work and develop better

987
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:39,730
defenses so to be posted up very soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>
