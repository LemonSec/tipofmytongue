00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:31,250
second second day of last con my last

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,500
time I spoke at last con was 2011

5
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,080
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those ways back so</font>

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,760
it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be back speaking</font>

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,110
I've been here in the interim that's

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,730
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see all of you this morning so I</font>

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,190
this is a presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,519
James wicket and I created for our

11
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:54,260
essays rugged DevOps track last year and

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,940
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it here as well I'm</font>

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,660
actively involved with the DevOps

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:03,260
community here in Austin<font color="#CCCCCC"> run DevOps days</font>

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Austin which is coming in may and James</font>

16
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,759
and I both blog together at the agile

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,970
admin com who's been out to a DevOps

18
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,509
days Austin in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their in their life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">right cool well more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can come</font>

20
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:24,619
this may all right so DevOps has changed

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,940
my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm here to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> share the</font>

22
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,800
understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same lean</font>

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,929
techniques that have revolutionized

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,910
development and operations and show how

25
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:35,720
they can improve the effectiveness of

26
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,280
security work as well so in a recent

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,649
book by Stephen Bell oven thinking

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,810
security he points out that we're

29
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:44,780
failing in our attempts to turn security

30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,090
spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> into real security because we're</font>

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:52,280
spending our limited resources on the

32
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:54,679
wrong things even when we have the bad

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,840
guys outnumbered they still seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to slip</font>

34
00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:02,810
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> our fingers not necessarily</font>

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:05,060
through any skill of their own right so

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,160
to talk about lean real quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,410
to talk about agile and DevOps first

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,980
just I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

39
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,390
everybody knows what I'm talking about

40
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I'll go through those pieces</font>

41
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,269
reasonably clear who who hears familiar

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,160
with with agile software development all

43
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,579
right who here works for an organization

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,230
with where they are doing so you know so

45
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:30,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave some set of the people are</font>

46
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,440
doing agile development

47
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,779
ok cool that's that looks like just

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,290
about the percentage I'm about to about

49
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,030
to tell you so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have probably</font>

50
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,700
at least seen agile you've seen it done

51
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,200
right seen it done wrong there's more to

52
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,549
it but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the core agile manifesto</font>

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,760
agile has become widespread in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

54
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,500
industry right so forty-five percent of

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,070
organizations are using an autumn<font color="#E5E5E5"> adoro</font>

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">T of their teams and why because it's</font>

57
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,269
provided clear benefits to software

58
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,369
development organizations over the last

59
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:09,860
what is it now<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 11 years since the</font>

60
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:13,850
agile manifesto was created so<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps</font>

61
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:17,540
newer right starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> around starting</font>

62
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,730
around 2010 so even after agile we had a

63
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,519
problem with development and operations

64
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,480
being siloed and chasing opposing goals

65
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,580
in the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps was</font>

66
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,799
conceptualized as way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correct that</font>

67
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,170
Tom limoncellos book the practice of

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,150
cloud system administration says that

69
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,600
DevOps is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application of agile</font>

70
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,640
methodology<font color="#E5E5E5"> to system administration</font>

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,850
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a definition of DevOps that we</font>

72
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,980
have on the agile admin that has that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

73
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:51,230
fair number of people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided to</font>

74
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:53,540
agree with so we're no longer really

75
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,548
having conversations about whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

76
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,530
not DevOps is the thing we're now

77
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:00,170
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rate of adoption how</font>

78
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,090
it's quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing and the kinds of</font>

79
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:06,320
benefits it's showing to adopting

80
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations so Gartner and I I guess</font>

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,890
they'll tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> if their prediction was</font>

82
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,019
right here sometime soon but they

83
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,950
predicted that by 2016<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five</font>

84
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent of global organizations would be</font>

85
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,858
making use of DevOps<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoo-hoo here isn't</font>

86
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:26,930
an organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in some manner</font>

87
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:28,729
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps all right now that looks</font>

88
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">like more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than twenty-five percent so i</font>

89
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:35,990
can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> gartner there they're on track</font>

90
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,640
and why so the puppet labs state of

91
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,590
DevOps report which you know was

92
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,950
compiled by a data scientist right it's

93
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just a random vendor thing it's real</font>

94
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,000
survey

95
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,340
shows that companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are getting orders</font>

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,890
of magnitude value out of DevOps right

97
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,549
this isn't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh its twenty percent</font>

98
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:57,400
better right it's it's huge multipliers

99
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:02,020
I in terms of recovering from failure

100
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,310
and deploying more quickly so that just

101
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,349
sets a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a background and</font>

102
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,720
that brings us to lean who here is

103
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,200
familiar with lean in some context

104
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,980
manufacturing lean software development

105
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:19,200
okay so some folks lean six sigma<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

106
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,280
guess who here is a six sigma person

107
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on sit in for a sec conference</font>

108
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,630
it's gotta be somebody into that all

109
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:32,470
right what's an old certification uh so

110
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,670
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> lean so lean started off by</font>

111
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,010
revolutionising the world of

112
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,260
manufacturing bride was pioneered by W

113
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,719
Edwards Deming later popularized in the

114
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,010
Toyota Production system but since then

115
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
it's been adapted to software

116
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,620
development its practices include value

117
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,469
stream mapping waist pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> queueing</font>

118
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">theory human motivation measurement and</font>

119
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,660
visualization of metrics TDD and we'll

120
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,400
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of those in the context</font>

121
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,680
of improving security work later in the

122
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,690
presentation these are the these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

131
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:33,160
right like actually a lot of the benefit

132
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Toyota got out of lean was they</font>

133
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,120
initially applied it to manufacturing

134
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,650
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they very quickly moved to applying</font>

135
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,660
it to product development as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

136
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,250
it's not like Eric Ries invented this

137
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,050
but he kind of popularized it and

138
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,510
brought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the kind of start up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II</font>

characterizes the core loop inside the

measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn right in the new repeat</font>

143
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,950
and if the heart of it lean is about

144
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,780
bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

highest leverage at any given time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

147
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,040
gets confusing how these all fit

overall picture because I know once you

155
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,360
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about multiple kind of</font>

156
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:33,010
conceptual frameworks it's like what

157
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,620
what's what's all this about so so

158
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,170
that's the the just quickie version of

159
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,320
what is lean and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unpack it a</font>

160
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:44,380
lot going forward here so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

163
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,920
of these and what they're going to do to

<font color="#CCCCCC">your security life aha you're smart</font>

166
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,039
that's the wrong question right so if

167
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,400
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at every new innovation whether</font>

it's you know lean DevOps cloud social

170
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,520
through the filter of how is it a threat

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> security then you're adopting a</font>

174
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,770
instead we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about how</font>

175
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,169
adopting these strategies can help you

176
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,799
win how you can actually you know that

177
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,480
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not methodologies that are</font>

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,490
just for development or just for

179
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,100
whatever they have been proven<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it to</font>

180
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,830
improve operational processes in

honest had stagnated in innovation for

188
00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:00,130
about a decade right and and everybody

189
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,800
knows it right when i started i started

being done in 1993 same was being

195
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:22,449
done in 2003 right I mean there had been

196
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,880
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little innovation and eventually</font>

197
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,100
the industry got fed up with that like

198
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,280
part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the success of DevOps has been</font>

199
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,660
it's cool but part of its successes that

200
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,970
businesses are finally looking at you

201
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,560
know that the weird you know troll

202
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,290
techies behind the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saying you</font>

203

know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you can't just wave your</font>

sand you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something that's</font>

206
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:49,210
going to contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

207
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:52,780
organization right and that's that's a

208
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,540
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of all of us who were</font>

209
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:59,170
originally kind of caught up in the

210

<font color="#CCCCCC">DevOps movement went through and so I</font>

211
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,819
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help I'll help you bring that</font>

212
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:08,890
same thing to security right lean

213
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:10,510
security is for winners if later people

214
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">at home with the video want to use this</font>

215
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:18,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to green screen other videos on that's</font>

216
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:20,560
that's perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so the six fold path</font>

217
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,839
of lean security I'm going to cover six

218
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,180
challenges that are commonly faced by

219
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security organizations and</font>

220
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,979
explain how you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

221
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the lean techniques to to do</font>

222
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,980
them more effectively right in each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

223
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,569
these is very similar to a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

224
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had in ops right and seemed</font>

225
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,250
intractable before we found DevOps I

226
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,250
really appreciate the previous talk and

227
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:48,900
focusing on you know how you communicate

228
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:51,880
a lot of human factor stuff like there's

229
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,340
we bash our heads against the same

230
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,130
problems day after day year after year

231
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,840
frequently right and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they</font>

232
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,930
don't we don't make headway on them and

233
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,930
when that's the case a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

234
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,569
there's there's another way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

235
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,209
right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and that's that's how I</font>

236
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:14,890
felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps was it's like I had a team</font>

237
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:17,890
Josh was on it right i mean we tried to

238
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,660
professionalize web operations and we

239
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,900
did all this stuff and came up with

240
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,649
system development processes and bought

241
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,379
great too

242
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,240
and all that and it was still hard still

243
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:30,579
a pain in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass it still in the end</font>

244
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't successful right like our team</font>

245
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:36,699
was the bottleneck right you know and

246
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,469
finally seeing hey there's another way

247
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:42,248
we can come at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem with super</font>

248
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,399
valuable so number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one security it's</font>

249
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:50,829
just being counting right who's heard

250
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,999
this one yeah some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your arms are</font>

251
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,910
getting tired but I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

252
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:57,639
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so so while all these</font>

253
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:00,850
criticisms aren't fair they're also not

254
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,709
completely unfounded right so this

255
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,420
complaint is you're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to check</font>

256
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:06,609
boxes you're not you're not really

257
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,429
helping make anything more secure right

258
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,589
in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> book on browser security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Michaels</font>

259
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,209
allow ski has a he has a great intro

260
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,490
covering the history of information

261
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:18,429
security and he notes that at some point

262
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,290
we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that risk management was able</font>

263
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:22,720
to fill the development and<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation</font>

264
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,248
gaps that we experienced and so we

265
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,769
became experts<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's structured</font>

266
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:29,439
inadequacy and wrapping problems with

267
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:32,649
policies and accept the risk statements

268
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:35,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright we traded engineering for</font>

269
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:38,170
actuarial duties and problem is that

270
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:42,309
this doesn't create value so let's talk

271
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:46,569
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> value so the the number one lean</font>

272
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:50,110
concept is value understanding of what

273
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:52,809
is value this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example of a lean</font>

274
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,870
value stream map and this is kind of

275
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:59,620
your typical you know manufacturing sort

276
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,709
of thing and lean says hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on</font>

277
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,110
finding out what the actual real value

278
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:07,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">adds steps are in the creation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

279
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,459
product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright in lean</font>

280
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,769
software they call this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept to</font>

281
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:13,719
cash flow right it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the</font>

282
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,850
idea you develop it you deliver it out

283
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,439
to customers you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally you</font>

284
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,799
actually sell it and get their money and

285
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,379
then you get cash right so take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font>

286
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,170
and think about like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job do you</font>

287
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:29,259
understand exactly what value you're

288
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,479
creating and at what points in the

289
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:34,029
creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your product or service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

290
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,950
it applies is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a compliance check</font>

291
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,710
box at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process and we're</font>

292
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,090
could you be creating more value

293
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,890
everybody's everybody's value stream is

294
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:46,820
going to be different / what sort of an

295
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:49,910
organization they work in right so Johan

296
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Baker took a stab at at kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

297
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:55,550
what lean value statements of a security

298
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,680
organization might look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and note</font>

299
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it hinges on creating a solution</font>

300
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,930
custom to your organization right so he

301
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:06,350
wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> a leading security management</font>

302
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,329
white paper that I'm not going to read

303
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,030
all that bullet points to you right but

304
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,180
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what creating value</font>

305
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:17,600
looks like for a for security controls

306
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,750
and one of the points here you know he

307
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,560
kind of makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point a couple times</font>

308
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:26,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's custom right so one of the</font>

309
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,640
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really learned a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot in</font>

310
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,640
DevOps is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever stock</font>

311
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,100
answers you've got taught in<font color="#CCCCCC"> op school</font>

312
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,350
or security school or whatever they're

313
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,930
not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the value that your</font>

314
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:42,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization needs from you right that</font>

315
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,660
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is extremely customized so</font>

316
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,930
it's good that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with an</font>

317
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:50,480
array of practices but even the idea of

318
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,250
well I know best practices like that

319
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,520
started to get frowned on a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

320
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,430
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know some practices</font>

321
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,310
that are good in certain circumstances

322
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,540
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not cognizant enough of</font>

323
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,430
the circumstances<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which you're</font>

324
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,699
applying them you may not be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

325
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,770
right thing so here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

326
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,430
years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at national</font>

327
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:16,310
instruments in the in engineering in the

328
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">ni cloud group and we were making a fpga</font>

329
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">compile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud product right and this was</font>

330
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,920
a SAS product where people would upload

331
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,350
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> fpga designs and compile them all</font>

332
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,430
right it's still online today as best as

333
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know so and of course customers are</font>

334
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,170
uploading<font color="#E5E5E5"> their pretty sensitive IP</font>

335
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:39,020
right you know for fpga sort of

336
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,839
compilations and so we aligned our

337
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,230
security work with end customer concern

338
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,960
so we were like hey one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest</font>

339
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,850
impediments to customers up taking this

340
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,209
product is security concerns

341
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:58,339
so when we came up with a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan</font>

342
00:15:53,209 --> 00:16:00,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was very focused on kind of not just</font>

343
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:03,139
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things but communicating them</font>

344
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:06,380
generating<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive marketing messages</font>

345
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:09,050
about the security work that we had put

346
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,670
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I we've got it we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cissp</font>

347
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,729
we've done threat modeling we've done

348
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,889
all this and your data is yours and and

349
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:19,100
this greatly facilitated adoption right

350
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:20,600
so we never had any like people would be

351
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,089
like what about security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and would be</font>

352
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,730
like here's the stuff we've done and

353
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,649
like then it all you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> always just</font>

354
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,870
go away like we didn't have anybody not

355
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:33,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">uptake the solution because of fears of</font>

356
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:35,420
security right and just just like the

357
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:37,069
point in the earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about you know</font>

358
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not your skill you're</font>

359
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:42,139
selling to somebody it's the you know

360
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,939
it's the communication of it we focused

361
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,709
that security plan around what was

362
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,319
actually going to create value because

363
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:50,089
it anybody in an organization that

364
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:52,579
thinks they don't have anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

365
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:56,000
with with sales or whatever that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

366
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:58,489
dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> attitude to have right if your</font>

367
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,620
overhead prepare to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your ass cut</font>

368
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,680
right whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whenever sales</font>

369
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,539
are down but your business is the health

370
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,339
of your business it's not locking down

371
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:11,299
its data it's whatever it's the health

372
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:14,149
of the overall business right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

373
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:16,220
two security is a bottleneck right we're

374
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:20,179
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get work done and you're</font>

375
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're just slowing us down like oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

376
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:26,959
or not but fortune magazine just

377
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,570
reported this year that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average time</font>

378
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deliver corporate IT projects had</font>

379
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,580
increased from eight point five months

380
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to 10 months in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

381
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:41,928
right and why is that security I mean

382
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the the straight-up answer was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

383
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,640
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> the growth of control and risk</font>

384
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,918
management functions that's too often

385
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,080
poorly coordinated resulting in a

386
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,610
proliferation of new tasks in the areas

387
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">of compliance privacy and data</font>

388
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:59,658
protection right so you know that is an

389
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:03,290
additional you know an additional

390
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifteen percent of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost to delay</font>

391
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:08,629
you makin money right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a</font>

392
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem so now we're going to talk about</font>

393
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second underlying principle of lien</font>

394
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,980
which is waste right so the first one is

395
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:18,970
value second was waste and being

396
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,710
sensitive to time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be honest like</font>

397
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,600
often security departments are guilty of

398
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,150
squandering it in other other

399
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,080
departments as well right so one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

400
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:32,090
one of my favorite interactions of all

401
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,020
time was with the purchasing department

402
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,939
back at national instruments right they

403
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,710
they had a guy and he was great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

404
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,720
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of guy he would go into</font>

405
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,240
walmart and he would come out with a

406
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,290
discount<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stuff he bought their right</font>

407
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,860
like he<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't he was hardcore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hagler</font>

408
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,960
dude right and so we'd would try to buy

409
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,139
some tool you know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

410
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,480
needed to deliver a project and be like

411
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,490
I'm gonna get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that price down but it's</font>

412
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,960
going to take as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as it's going to</font>

413
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,110
take would try to put a timeline

414
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,660
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> who'd be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no the the lowest</font>

415
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,179
price or the highest security right

416
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,890
that's the ultimate value<font color="#E5E5E5"> however long</font>

417
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,130
it takes to get there that's how long

418
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:19,670
it's going to take right the problem is

419
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:23,840
that shows a profound ignorance of

420
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:26,420
business a profound ignorance right so I

421
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,189
was like dude if you delay us by a month

422
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,800
and save us another five thousand

423
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,660
dollars this project we're trying to get

424
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> door is called the million</font>

425
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollar project for a reason like you're</font>

426
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:41,300
losing us money every day you haggle

427
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:45,500
over that<font color="#E5E5E5"> $5,000 you're gonna stop now</font>

428
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:47,510
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's like do the best</font>

429
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,690
you can in this two weeks we're going to

430
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:54,470
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do it so we're going to</font>

431
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:57,350
talk about waste so lean talks about

432
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,840
waste in a very structured way right so

433
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,600
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> three types of waste muda</font>

434
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">Marie and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Maura that the Japanese were</font>

435
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,300
big on early lean so there's a lot of

436
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,920
Japanese words in here right so muda is

437
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,629
the one that gets discussed the most

438
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">although you might see how Marie which</font>

439
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,080
is kind of unreasonable demand and over

440
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,990
pressure and more

441
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,269
which you could say is lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of flow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

442
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,929
can come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in securities interaction</font>

443
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:27,950
with the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization muda</font>

444
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:30,289
has seven forms so I've got two slides

445
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,000
the seven forms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> muda can be seen in</font>

446
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:35,299
security operations and here's a couple

447
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,269
security centric examples right but the

448
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:41,149
overall takeaway is analyze what you're

449
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:43,880
doing and identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the areas of waste in</font>

450
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:46,370
it right so waste can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be excess</font>

451
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,799
inventory<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right this is the this is</font>

452
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,239
the pure developer here's the thousand

453
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,559
page PDF of vulnerabilities I got out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

454
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,590
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to pick on rapid seven but</font>

455
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,960
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever right like you know he</font>

456
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:04,279
reaches go figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out right over</font>

457
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:07,190
production so more security controls are

458
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:09,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">not always a good thing I know this</font>

459
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,750
blows your mind right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

460
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,149
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everybody has to learn</font>

461
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,039
developers have to let you know product

462
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:18,529
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have learned more features or not</font>

463
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,330
always necessarily good developers have

464
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,760
learned more code is not necessarily

465
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,340
always good systems people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

466
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,529
more more systems more complexity there

467
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,809
is not always good more security

468
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:31,730
controls are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always good right if</font>

469
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,760
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are stemming from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fodor from</font>

470
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,159
misalignment with business needs

471
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,830
anything you spend time effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> money on</font>

472
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:44,380
that is not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> highest value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font>

473
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:48,559
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is is a screw-up right</font>

474
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,510
so extra processing right relying on

475
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,428
compliance testing instead of designing

476
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:56,330
security into the process in the first

477
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:58,100
place hey and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting I'm not going</font>

478
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,830
to read each one of these to you but

479
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,928
mood is separated into two types there's

480
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:07,460
what's called type 1 muda which is

481
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:10,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessary like compliance right so it's</font>

482
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,460
necessary but it doesn't add value so

483
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:17,570
value is your product<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes more</font>

484
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:22,070
secure right type 2 muda is just plain

485
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:24,139
unneeded so kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I urge you</font>

486
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:28,279
to think about is even if you're just

487
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:29,179
focused on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the necessary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones do you</font>

488
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,980
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

489
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,650
you know describe your career when you

490
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,380
go home for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thanksgiving as type 1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> waste</font>

491
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:39,020
right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's not super</font>

492
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,640
inspiring right so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

493
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,220
understand the waste<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you generate</font>

494
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,990
now zero waste isn't uh isn't a

495
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,390
reasonable goal right<font color="#E5E5E5"> as everybody</font>

496
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,630
that's tried to follow whatever the

497
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:54,790
newest arcane recycling regulations

498
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:57,920
around here are but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a goal and</font>

499
00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,500
what lean says is hey identify where

500
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,780
you're adding value identify where

501
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,880
you're adding waste so that you can then

502
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,889
work on those frequently it's just

503
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,840
something we don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about right</font>

504
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:12,280
we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like well I got my job done</font>

505
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,810
right I delivered that thousand-page

506
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,440
vulnerability thing I i checked the

507
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,870
check box right but that overall value

508
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,480
stream map that concept to cash flow

509
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:25,580
your company successful is directly

510
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,710
proportional to how fast you get from

511
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,860
this end to that end so if you have done

512
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,390
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it slower like take it</font>

513
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">from eight point five months to 10</font>

514
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,650
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get from here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

515
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,810
here right that's a significant downside

516
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,640
to your company so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you don't</font>

517
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:44,300
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security but you can't just</font>

518
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,030
say well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's super</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

519
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,760
so the waste doesn't matter right which

520
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:53,629
is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be honest an opinion</font>

521
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,970
I've heard right number three security

522
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:59,090
is invisible right so people are tempted

523
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:01,280
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in search</font>

524
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,610
of a problem when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see how it</font>

525
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,950
fits into everything right and we're

526
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:14,060
quick to say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> Security's everyone's</font>

527
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:16,580
job right the problem is that's that's a

528
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:20,590
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern that has been tried and</font>

529
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:23,659
failed before right so in operations

530
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:26,000
performance right performance used to be

531
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:29,210
invisible and we used to say it's

532
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,910
everybody's job right and then no one

533
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,830
did anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it insecurity has a</font>

534
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,660
lot of correlation corollaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

535
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,179
the application performance problems of

536
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,010
five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so in the</font>

537
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,360
performance field there was actually a

538
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,520
bit of a bit of kind of a rev

539
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steve Souders who helped form the</font>

540
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:51,810
velocity conference he was heading up

541
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:54,149
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo high performance group who</font>

542
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:57,690
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem right there like</font>

543
00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Yahoo there's a crapload of groups doing</font>

544
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:03,420
a bunch of crazy stuff we're the

545
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,910
performance team how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we supposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

546
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,950
do this right if we just tell everybody

547
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,530
make your stuff fast or try to put rules

548
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,960
in place like that's that's losing

549
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,600
before you start right but also we can't

550
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,030
do it for everybody that and that's

551
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,939
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how most security organizations</font>

552
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:25,080
are formed in enterprises right now

553
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,880
right so what what they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they</font>

554
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,909
stopped passing the buck around it

555
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,830
started focusing on visualization right

556
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,900
they started putting it's like hey we'll

557
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,240
put in browser extensions so you can see

558
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,600
exactly what's going on we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

559
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,910
share you know research<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you showing</font>

560
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,500
performance to revenue correlation they

561
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,270
had a great they had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great talk at</font>

562
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,330
velocity where they got both Google and

563
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,470
Microsoft to come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on stage and say</font>

564
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,990
so we did experiments where we

565
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:55,080
deliberately inserted<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 milliseconds</font>

566
00:25:51,990 --> 00:26:00,450
of delay into in our websites and this

567
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:02,879
is the revenue hit we took right you

568
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:06,720
know it logs conferences can be

569
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,470
essentially commitment to two metrics

570
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">touring and visualization right and many</font>

571
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:16,890
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same things are being done in</font>

572
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:19,080
security but ask yourself are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

573
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,060
you using<font color="#CCCCCC"> them right so a lot of these</font>

574
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">things exist but they're not i would say</font>

575
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:27,360
pervasive and the trick is to share them

576
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,240
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing the work</font>

577
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,719
right so this is a lean principle it's

578
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,210
called see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole and it says that you</font>

579
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,370
are best able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create value when you</font>

580
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the perspective of what's going on</font>

581
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall system and lean software</font>

582
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,470
development talks extensively about

583
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,890
metrics collection and visible

584
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:50,010
visualization so you have to open

585
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:54,180
adoption or open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brad broadcast kind of</font>

586
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,920
mentality so I know many of you got you

587
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">know whatever need to know</font>

588
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,450
basis least privilege or whatever beat

589
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,580
into you in cissp school or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it</font>

590
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:06,900
was right so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

591
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:09,360
unlearn that to a degree because people

592
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,030
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know so if if you want that</font>

593
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,719
development team to be motivated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put</font>

594
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:17,100
security into there another thing then

595
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,800
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

596
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,020
broadcasting those metrics to write your

597
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,290
whole all I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell the</font>

598
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:27,450
important CIO CEO whatever guy and he'll

599
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,490
force everybody to do it how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

600
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:33,630
working out for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean get a grip</font>

601
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:36,420
right that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> winning I mean I've</font>

602
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:40,950
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've been at security</font>

603
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:42,330
events for a decade right and we're as

604
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,610
best as I could tell we're in a worse

605
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,960
state than we were 10 years ago in terms

606
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,770
of overall security of our

607
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,500
infrastructure right so you have to open

608
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:55,980
adopt that open broadcast mentality and

609
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,600
share right share and add visibility to

610
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people who can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

611
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,110
things secure so visualize it so

612
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,420
everybody can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it number four</font>

613
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,040
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> is always too late right so</font>

614
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,200
there's a part of security that's

615
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,909
inherently reactive right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

616
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,610
there's a breach yeah you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

617
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,010
respond to it a vulnerability has gone

618
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,320
live into production oh we got a we got

619
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:23,129
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix that that's up sev one defect</font>

620
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,760
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deming address this very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> early</font>

621
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,900
in lean so normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't read my</font>

622
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,150
slides but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read this one</font>

623
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,460
sees dependence on mass inspection to

624
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,080
achieve quality improve the process and

625
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,600
build quality into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product in the</font>

626
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,720
first place like Shannon maybe somebody

627
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,219
had a quote very<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this in a slide</font>

628
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,230
attributed to someone newer here at this

629
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,480
conference but this this comes

630
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,250
originally from Deming right so there's

631
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,240
a lean software principal called build

632
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:53,790
integrity in so the more that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

633
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,070
create fast feedback loops these are

634
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:58,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jing Kim's three ways of DevOps right</font>

635
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,990
the more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can create fast feedback</font>

636
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:02,520
loops that detect and remediating

637
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,800
problems continually as part of your

638
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,550
engineers normal work processes the less

639
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,810
waste you generate right so if by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">time a a vole</font>

00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,280
ability has gotten out to production and

642
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,530
you're like oh somebody needs to fix

643
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,410
that right there's a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

644
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,540
waste entailed in that the developer

645
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,610
actually just wrote that code has moved

646
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,800
on to something else that bug may or may

647
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,300
not get assigned back to them it's going

648
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,310
to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product manager get</font>

649
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:33,510
prioritized into a sprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a lot of</font>

650
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,919
handling right to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same effect</font>

651
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,280
that if they had just<font color="#E5E5E5"> caught that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

652
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,720
unit tests the beginning so something

653
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,460
that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to dwell on because</font>

654
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,950
you've heard it and Lord knows how many

655
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,510
presentations here right is integrating

656
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,950
security into your continuous

657
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:51,240
integration pipeline I know Matt to

658
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:54,630
sorrow has a great much more elaborate

659
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,610
presentation on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this since James helped</font>

660
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,980
write this presentation I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

661
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:05,699
legally obliged to pimp gauntlet while I

662
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:07,350
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so so so as an example and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

663
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,000
know we all hear this go by but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

664
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show a little bit actual codes the</font>

665
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,070
chip kind of get get where it's going so

666
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a syntax called gherkin that's</font>

667
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:19,439
used by by<font color="#CCCCCC"> test-driven tools that</font>

668
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,890
developers actually use like cucumber

669
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,480
and robot framework right and so

670
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,950
gauntlet basically uses that exact same

671
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,810
gherkin syntax something that a

672
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:32,520
developer is already going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

673
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with right to define define in</font>

674
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,910
a BDD sort of way you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

675
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,360
testing and then as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run your</font>

676
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,670
continuous integration pipeline you run

677
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,449
you know you you run scans whatever with

678
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,760
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of different tools until</font>

679
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,130
you know until the build either passes

680
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,190
or doesn't and this provides continuous

681
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,810
feedback at a very close point not as

682
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,760
close as like something even built into

683
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:02,340
the IDE which would be best right but

684
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,850
still pretty close<font color="#E5E5E5"> and enables positive</font>

685
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,280
change with the least amount of waste

686
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:11,129
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in even our our QA</font>

687
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:14,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">department right wit an alien vault</font>

688
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:17,130
where I work right now they have focused

689
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:20,670
on building more and more tooling even

690
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:23,580
into the developers IDE because if you

691
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">can catch problems like the second after</font>

692
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,539
they

693
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,689
it in or you know when they're ide

694
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:34,129
auto-saves again even waiting until it

695
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:36,470
goes to a CI pipeline like that takes a

696
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,840
while and it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow our build takes</font>

697
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:41,059
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple hours because of all</font>

698
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,990
the different platforms that it compiles

699
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:47,090
down to write so workshop tutorial James

700
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,860
showed this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk yesterday as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

701
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,110
but if you want a whole hands-on

702
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,600
workshop on how to implement this

703
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:56,209
there's that these slides are already on

704
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,980
SlideShare so you can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

705
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,360
these out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so don't wait till the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

706
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,519
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what could be done in</font>

707
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,120
conjunction with<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of these value</font>

708
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,000
creation steps so number five security

709
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's always in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way so there's a fine</font>

710
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,730
difference between being a bottleneck

711
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,949
due to constraints but i think it's it's

712
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,350
fair to say that in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of places</font>

713
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:20,539
engineers consider security to be

714
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,389
actively messing with them right i mean

715
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:26,210
it has anybody ever had that reaction

716
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:27,949
from from people that they're bringing

717
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,690
you know bringing vulnerabilities to or

718
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,779
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like you're just you're</font>

719
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,490
just jacking with me man like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

720
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:38,360
know it's a it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal human reaction</font>

721
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:40,130
and yes and again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous talk</font>

722
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,949
had some great examples of how do you

723
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,970
how do you maybe communicate it so that

724
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:49,279
you're not that guy don't be that guy

725
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,899
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy right you already</font>

726
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,789
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't make things secure by</font>

727
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:55,668
yourself you need everybody else to

728
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:59,090
cooperate with you but like you know do

729
00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:01,779
you just anger them so there's another

730
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:04,760
lean principal called empower the team

731
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:08,210
right so you need to understand human

732
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:11,690
motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a brilliant</font>

733
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution to this problem so it's funny</font>

734
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:19,880
knit a turian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cockcroft from netflix</font>

735
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:21,678
spoke here here at at last con / app sec

736
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,000
the year that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was that it was both</font>

737
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:29,000
right and he was like oh yet yeah

738
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,370
netflix we don't have any process right

739
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was like holy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you</font>

740
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,629
mean by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's because</font>

741
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,730
obviously that's not even possible right

742
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,740
like you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

743
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:42,650
like your process my crappy or whatever

744
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,590
but like there's a process but what he

745
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:47,630
meant was that they've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

746
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,689
right thing part of the systems that

747
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:54,200
everyone uses so there's perception that

748
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:56,300
there's no process so as part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix</font>

749
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">a simian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> army right it folks may have</font>

750
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,220
heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chaos monkey who's heard of</font>

751
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,690
chaos monkey<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right it's basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

752
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,640
made thing that goes out and kills

753
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,980
servers at random to make sure that

754
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,960
everybody has built their applications

755
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,820
to be resilient right they have another

756
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a number of other monkey's there's</font>

757
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:18,020
the security monkey and the janitor

758
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:21,290
monkey and what these<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is like if you</font>

759
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,679
launch AWS instance and it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

760
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:27,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right tags on it it just kills it</font>

761
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,600
right so think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you normally</font>

762
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,389
address this and and I've done this

763
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,420
right running<font color="#E5E5E5"> team so you're like oh we</font>

764
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:38,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">need people to start tagging these these</font>

765
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,920
systems well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i'm going to i'm</font>

766
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,330
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start generating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of</font>

767
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,090
who's not in compliance i'm going to

768
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,650
email it around<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that caught that</font>

769
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,540
convinced twenty percent of people to

770
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,650
get their act together<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now i'm</font>

771
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start you know i'm going to</font>

772
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,530
start emailing people individual i'm

773
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,449
going to go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

774
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,660
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the clipboard be like hey</font>

775
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:59,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">your things are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of compliance right</font>

776
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:02,420
and then you're that guy people are like

777
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:08,480
oh there's that asshole you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with</font>

778
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:11,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the clipboard right so netflix they said</font>

779
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that basically way said was well so we</font>

780
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">just built that into the system so you</font>

781
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,660
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it and crash and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a</font>

782
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden all of the emotional content</font>

783
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:22,250
dropped out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that transaction it's</font>

784
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,870
like you might think you might think oh

785
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,700
well that would just make<font color="#E5E5E5"> people mad or</font>

786
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,759
whatever it's like you know in terms of

787
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:31,100
intrusiveness of a thing you're doing

788
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,930
like automatically killing seems like

789
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,759
you would keep going up here but it

790
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:38,540
didn't it just dropped off because

791
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,550
people are just like oh well that's how

792
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">it works right i mean you only</font>

793
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,570
occasionally get mad at your cable box

794
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,310
when it when you know because the

795
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,840
channel guide sucks or whatever but by

796
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,029
and large or just like okay like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

797
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,840
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how it works right so</font>

798
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:56,480
Oh automating that process removed the

799
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,660
emotional charge right so it's also

800
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,800
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of be nice and you</font>

801
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,799
know pick your language and stuff like

802
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,470
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> self service automation that</font>

803
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">helps you build integrity in instead of</font>

804
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:12,410
relying on mass inspection after things

805
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:15,200
have already been done wrong so<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

806
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,029
six security is perfectionist and

807
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,859
therefore unrealistic right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

808
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,090
it's like man every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the</font>

809
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,380
security guy they're like well if you

810
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have this and dlp and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I ds's a new</font>

811
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:32,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">fangled wife and all of this stuff then</font>

812
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:34,750
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing it right right so</font>

813
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,430
here's the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is a product</font>

814
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,820
it's like any other product right and

815
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:42,169
all products have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make trade-offs</font>

816
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:47,330
about what they'll do and what they

817
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't do right so if you listen to some</font>

818
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:52,640
folks you can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security without you</font>

819
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:55,730
know directly reporting to the CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

820
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,420
having a 1.2 million dollar budget to

821
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:01,960
buy the six or seven six figure you know

822
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:05,060
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> products that you need right</font>

823
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,820
but what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't get that right or</font>

824
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,380
even if you can many of those tools they

825
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,480
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be a good fit for your</font>

826
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,970
particular needs but also they take a

827
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,530
long time to implement right I mean God

828
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,359
love all our vendors I out there but

829
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,510
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of those things you buy him</font>

830
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,340
and then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

831
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:26,600
reasonably a six-month project with

832
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:30,860
people to get it all going so it has

833
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:35,509
anybody not figured this out yet Mo

834
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:37,550
Money mo problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so lean</font>

835
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:40,160
startup describes the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

836
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:43,160
efficiency problem right rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

837
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,560
adding waste by doing long analysis

838
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,410
cycles implement something small and

839
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,080
fast and lies the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> in iterate</font>

840
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,000
often layers of a couple imperfect items

841
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:57,500
yields better security than one perfect

842
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,360
item right so you know it's it's very

843
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,100
simple if you've got X amount of money

844
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,950
and two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people on your security team</font>

845
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:07,150
right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to spend that</font>

846
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:10,399
first six months just making the best

847
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:12,560
IDs on God's green earth and not

848
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,890
addressing any of the other aspects of

849
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,020
security like security is a weakest link

850
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,629
problem right has everybody heard that

851
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:23,060
right so you've poured a bunch of effort

852
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,740
into doing this one thing great and then

853
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:28,759
you've left all the windows open in your

854
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:30,740
house right so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread it out</font>

855
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,110
and iterate has anybody is anybody here

856
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:36,379
ever been a product manager done product

857
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:39,280
manager work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i mean it's its</font>

858
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:43,630
product management like you security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

859
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,560
by no means immune to the same

860
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,750
constraints right the Iron Triangle

861
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:52,000
right from product man I'm project

862
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">management and you have to you have to</font>

863
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,600
use the same prioritization you're

864
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,620
looking for your best overall outcome

865
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,180
right so I've I've recommended doing

866
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,299
this with monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> before so to use a</font>

867
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,299
simple example right monitoring you set

868
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,630
up a whole new system you do external

869
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:14,780
synthetic monitoring internal you know

870
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:17,480
you can instrument your apps you pull

871
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,400
metrics you take their logs you do all

872
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,500
this stuff right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tell you if you look</font>

873
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the monitoring world much like the</font>

874
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,250
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> world like there's a battery of</font>

875
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:28,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten different things that you would put</font>

876
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:31,010
together to be a you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a full</font>

877
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,319
end-to-end monitoring solution so rather

878
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">than pouring a lot of your time and</font>

879
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,660
effort on doing one of those huge and

880
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,520
then another one of those huge right you

881
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,529
iterate get something in place for all

882
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right you need a little bit of</font>

883
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,530
credentials management you need a little

884
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,160
bit of network security you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font>

885
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,870
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit instrument it figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

886
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,970
which of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need more of</font>

887
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">because again security school doesn't</font>

888
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:58,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean to your company right like do</font>

889
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,930
you need more network security do unit

890
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:03,529
like where are your threats coming from

891
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,180
right so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just iterate right it's</font>

892
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,340
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I did basic stuff okay these</font>

893
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,230
two areas need more<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention now i'm</font>

894
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to buy something more expensive</font>

895
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,520
put a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work into it stuff</font>

896
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,740
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> josh moore did a good lean</font>

897
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:22,770
security 101 presentation in 2012<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

898
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:26,529
a meeting that is worthwhile to look up

899
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:28,960
so DevOps realized that performance

900
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,330
reliability deployment all this was a

901
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,860
product with defined customers and the

902
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,049
need for active management and

903
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:38,410
prioritization it's the glory of the

904
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:40,750
stack rank backlog right i mean in the

905
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,160
end you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I and I've argued with</font>

906
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,510
managers<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this right you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

907
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,859
three top priorities it's like no like

908
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:50,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> bull crap in the end you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

909
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,460
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a stack ranked list and</font>

910
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,040
you do one thing and then you do another

911
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,350
thing maybe that's an explicit list or

912
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,500
maybe you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just making it up but</font>

913
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:01,118
multitasking is a lie right like even in

914
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,460
a computer it's like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

915
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,010
multitasking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's single packet tasking</font>

916
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,119
with context switching right so you know

917
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,650
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do the same thing with</font>

918
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,750
security manage it like a product

919
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:13,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">manager manages all the other aspects</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

920
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,640
a product so one of the reasons there's

921
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,910
been a DevOps track at this conference

922
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,799
since 2012 is because you know not so

923
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,720
many years ago we ops engineers were in

924
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,300
the same situation and had<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font>

925
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,089
same all these same criticisms and

926
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,970
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> leveled at us write operations</font>

927
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,710
was you know it best invisible<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

928
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,240
we were the bean counting bottleneck

929
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:37,090
that you know was always a day late and

930
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,500
dollar short but adopting these lead

931
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,180
principles has helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> our entire</font>

932
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,090
industry begin to innovate its way out

933
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that rut and I'd recommend you check</font>

934
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:47,590
them out and see if I can help you in

935
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:49,240
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> way and now I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know why</font>

936
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:58,600
done of these other presentations<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

937
00:41:49,240 --> 00:42:00,250
questions but questions that's why all

938
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,490
right well cool well thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

939
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">time</font>

940
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,210
