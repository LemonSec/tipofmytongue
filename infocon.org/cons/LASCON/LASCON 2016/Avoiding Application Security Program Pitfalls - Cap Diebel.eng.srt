2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,939
so here's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here's the agenda</font>

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,860
of what we're going to do and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,500
there's going to be some topical overlap

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,330
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous purple team it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,460
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the typical</font>

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,980
genesis of software security the anatomy

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,880
of a breach and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> SS a foundations</font>

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,099
and practices so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a cat people</font>

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I am the manager of application security</font>

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,200
at the denim group a a consultancy based

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,460
out of San Antonio in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in Austin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,309
Austin<font color="#E5E5E5"> off is actually just across the</font>

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">street so we work with a variety I've</font>

15
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,879
been doing this for over 11 years and we

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,910
worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a variety of technologies</font>

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,930
industries doing assessments helping

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">people develop their own programs</font>

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">helping people onboard tools and a great</font>

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,459
security and into their sdlc etc so

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,780
we're going to be focusing on software

22
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,000
security but we're software security

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,700
people so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to dwell on that</font>

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,840
so let's go ahead and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some SS</font>

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,399
a pitfalls so now talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these</font>

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,350
pitfalls because this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

27
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:24,530
we see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wild all the time so</font>

28
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,030
suppose we have executive leadership not

29
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,670
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology people but</font>

30
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision-makers that've drank the</font>

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,450
kool-aid they are on board<font color="#CCCCCC"> with doing</font>

32
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:34,160
application security they must implement

33
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,600
it because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and it could be</font>

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">for whatever reasons incidents</font>

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,458
regulations diligence are cautioned

36
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,429
ideally a combination of multiple ones

37
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:45,649
so being executives they for they have

38
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:47,119
an immediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision to make well who</font>

39
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,280
are they going to make responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,630
this you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they could</font>

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,539
potentially pull somebody out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

42
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,860
development you know but these these

43
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:58,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">people don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any process for</font>

44
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,410
security testing you know no security

45
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:02,599
training no time and well there's a

46
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:07,310
conflict of<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest these these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

47
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:09,440
necessarily security folks and so and we

48
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,090
also don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want people just doing</font>

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,700
security tests of their own stuff so it

50
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,970
makes more sense at the time to pull

51
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,099
somebody out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of i.t i.t has security so</font>

52
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,520
clearly our application security person

53
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,690
should also come from IT I think we here

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,180
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room know that this is not a</font>

55
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,090
terribly wise decision but to executive

56
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,099
leadership

57
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,870
this these are the options are weighing

58
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,720
and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a decision that makes</font>

59
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,450
sense for them so down comes the mandate

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,900
to IT all right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do some apps</font>

61
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:43,609
set so you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for this all</font>

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so I t receives this and says</font>

63
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,129
great well let's let's appoint somebody

64
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,780
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll name a bob or something to</font>

65
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,480
be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps ectly you are now in charge</font>

66
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,580
of application security now this person

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,010
is not necessarily a person is it

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,180
probably somebody is very capable you

69
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,040
know this person does understand

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,140
security they understand protocols and

71
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,970
transport layers and certifications and

72
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,700
hardening a perimeter and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

73
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,660
these these these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get security</font>

74
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,488
but may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a development</font>

75
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,140
background so now the app<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seikaly does</font>

76
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,989
understand that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a knowledge gap</font>

77
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,798
and so they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of figure out</font>

78
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">what how to do their job so somebody</font>

79
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,610
appointed from<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT security needs to get</font>

80
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:31,518
started what is some place<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

81
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:35,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">to in order to learn what to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> los</font>

82
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,079
conferences we see these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> show up</font>

83
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,760
at conferences all the time and who's

84
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:44,340
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to them when they first</font>

85
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:47,130
when they go to a conference yes vendors

86
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,170
right now of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have vendors here</font>

87
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,690
of course and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> good tools and</font>

88
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,268
we use we have used or currently use a

89
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,889
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that stuff but of course the</font>

90
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,650
fundamental problem here is it the first

91
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,329
person that this IT security person is

92
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,310
talking to is someone who's trying to

93
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">sell them something now this could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

94
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,139
good product but this is being procured

95
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,480
by someone who is not necessarily

96
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,819
capable of understanding all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risks</font>

97
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,078
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come with implementing this and all</font>

98
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,769
the work that comes with using this

99
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:19,590
properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now our apps</font>

100
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:23,700
likely has this tool they could be a no

101
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:27,090
static static<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis tool live testing</font>

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,409
tool combination of both and so that app

103
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,909
psych lead is going to retrieve

104
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,169
something that they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test could</font>

105
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,060
be source code maybe that repository

106
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,490
access maybe they<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask for the source</font>

107
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,960
code or a QA runway that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know those</font>

108
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,960
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense to test and</font>

109
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,850
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go ahead and run those</font>

110
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,120
run that stand and now they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

111
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,620
nice set of scan results by the way who

112
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,030
hasn't really been involved in this

113
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,620
process yet who doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

114
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,780
necessarily know what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

115
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,220
probably should know yeah developers

116
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,570
guess what's about to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

117
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,820
to happen to them oh they're about to

118
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,050
find out really<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon what's going what's</font>

119
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,580
what's going on right right looking at

120
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">it from this perspective we can see that</font>

121
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a disaster waiting to happen but</font>

122
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,720
you know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are this is a sequence of</font>

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,760
decisions that made sense at the time

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,340
those decisions were made and so here we

125
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,690
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> absite League gets those scan</font>

126
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:28,229
results and what's he going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

127
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:31,740
them hey developers say suckers I got

128
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">something for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I now have extra work</font>

129
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:39,510
half of which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually be</font>

130
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:43,830
valid problems and I your schedule is

131
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:47,450
what I don't know so scared<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what do</font>

132
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,450
you think is the developers reaction I

133
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,909
can't put a middle finger on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slide so</font>

134
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:58,560
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> result the</font>

135
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:01,110
resort to a frowny face developers you

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,050
know hey fix these developers say what

137
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,270
am I supposed to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this this is</font>

138
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,210
this is how a apps tech program

139
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,640
typically starts out but these are

140
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,310
decisions when you have a series of

141
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,099
decisions it makes sense at the time but

142
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,290
culminate into a situation where you're

143
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,650
actually not you're actually further

144
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,720
behind than you were when you started

145
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,870
avoid these pitfalls to bring ruin

146
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,760
confusion in strife into the developers

147
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:35,670
life so clearly we have our little

148
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,130
developers here here's our security and

149
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:43,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like to think of these little bombs as</font>

150
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:46,890
PDFs of a security vulnerability so here

151
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,580
you go sucker bleep you read this thing

152
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,020
because I don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read it and</font>

153
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,318
sure that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all things you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fix</font>

154
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,210
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a sneak attack it's going to</font>

155
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,400
when a developer sees a scan results

156
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,688
with one or two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three false positives</font>

157
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,560
what are they going to do what are they

158
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:06,439
going to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that set of results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

159
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">right this whole thing is garbage I'm</font>

160
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,580
not going to do anything and so now this

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,069
now this enterprise is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> further</font>

162
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,900
behind what it was that it was when they

163
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:17,629
were doing nothing now there is a poison

164
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,448
relationship between security and the

165
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:22,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">DES this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a situation of pushing</font>

166
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:27,620
mandates the staff are not prepared to

167
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:29,330
handle so the typical genesis of app

168
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,770
security in these scenarios we review

169
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,169
have a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in common the</font>

170
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,789
individual decisions made sense from

171
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:38,180
some perspective and for the person

172
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,969
making those decisions but a formal SS a

173
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,509
program can and a proper start can avoid

174
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:46,729
these pitfalls<font color="#E5E5E5"> so before we get into</font>

175
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,400
some foundations let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and look</font>

176
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,590
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a not too long ago breach and some of</font>

177
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,239
the failures that went into it and which

178
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,128
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those failures could have been</font>

179
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:01,310
addressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by an SS a program target</font>

180
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:02,930
let's talk about target um here has some

181
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,639
familiarity with the web dent how the

182
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,650
target breach happened some of the

183
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,270
things involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so about</font>

184
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,739
without half maybe a little bit less

185
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,359
familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

186
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,759
to dwell on what every little exploit

187
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,050
was but the general gist of it is we had

188
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the attackers here's the</font>

189
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,339
contractor that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially</font>

190
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:25,879
compromised down to a contractor portal

191
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:27,979
partner to partner system and then down

192
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,599
further into targets corporate network

193
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,969
all the way to point of sale so let's

194
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,870
look at what happened first thing they

195
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:38,539
did well as many talks already in this

196
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,698
conference have asserted attackers are

197
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,110
going to want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get credentials</font>

198
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:43,490
first right they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

199
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,440
anything sophisticated if something

200
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,390
simple is going to work in this case

201
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,449
simple being let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> after one of those</font>

202
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,100
mom-and-pop HVAC contractors get key

203
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:54,740
loggers on their machine so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get</font>

204
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,720
some credentials so the attackers used

205
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,550
Citadel<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a building contractor harvest</font>

206
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,190
keystrokes get there get<font color="#E5E5E5"> their password</font>

207
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the contractor portal the contractor</font>

208
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,070
could have

209
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,569
educated this risk but as target you

210
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,800
know there's there's there are a few

211
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,450
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do about this there are</font>

212
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,939
ways you can use like applets to check

213
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,770
and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any malware running</font>

214
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,960
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions for that but really</font>

215
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:20,240
target should be just presupposing that

216
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,920
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen now in the</font>

217
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,690
contractor portal there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

218
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,589
application vulnerable to a malicious

219
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:36,670
PHP uploads they the attackers uploaded

220
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:36,670
a PHP file called xml-rpc RPC stands for

221
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,480
right so anybody who saw this file name

222
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,280
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had smoke blowing out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

223
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,950
their ears when they saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

224
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">server right this is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

225
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,080
pretty this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remotely Sun</font>

226
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,690
right somebody threw up a remote shell

227
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,970
on there from there they started

228
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,440
querying ldap should this<font color="#E5E5E5"> system had</font>

229
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,910
access to ldap oh there's no there was

230
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,520
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for that but it did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

231
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,170
where they were you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so they did</font>

232
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,069
they did install network monitoring

233
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,510
tools they did extract ntlm hashes and

234
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,340
so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found someone else's domain</font>

235
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,870
admin account<font color="#CCCCCC"> and made their own so they</font>

236
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,170
could you know they could have a little

237
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,730
playground from their forward so with

238
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,260
the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> admin account they started</font>

239
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,180
scanning for anything that worked

240
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,890
accessible from this contractor portal

241
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,079
they found other services they found

242
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,060
other vulnerabilities and they set up a

243
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,550
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire a little file server on the</font>

244
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside now you see in the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

245
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,839
there's a little thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> called a fire I</font>

246
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,450
that was actually a proxy Network

247
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,920
designed to detect malicious activity

248
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,740
and it totally worked it actually caught

249
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,660
this activity the fire I did detect

250
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,610
suspicious activity but the info SEC

251
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,819
staff deactivated the automatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> nellore</font>

252
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,890
removal and neglected the warnings the

253
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,720
logging<font color="#CCCCCC"> system was really noisy and</font>

254
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,590
really messy and so they started turnin

255
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,460
stuff off i think to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks ago about the</font>

256
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,870
logging the gentleman<font color="#E5E5E5"> from in the main</font>

257
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,330
room there was talking about this this

258
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,710
kind of risk if you don't have a proper

259
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,030
way of sorting through the noise people

260
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">are tempted to start doing dumb stuff</font>

261
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,170
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this for some reason the point of</font>

to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of sale and this is one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">reason you'll do that so they put</font>

269
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,829
malware on the on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the POS systems</font>

270
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,990
specifically the registers and of course

271
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:38,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">they scraped all the payment card ever</font>

272
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,660
they swipe they scraped every card swipe

273
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,310
loaded up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file server and they</font>

274
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually were able to just toss it</font>

275
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,199
outside to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ftp server that they owned</font>

276
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,959
the failures here or<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost too numerous</font>

277
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:52,790
to count why did the firewall allow an

278
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,149
outbound connection from it no known

279
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,490
file server to unknown locations why did

280
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,139
the fire will allow ftp at all why

281
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,600
didn't the perimeter find the movement

282
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pci there were any if they had done</font>

283
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,120
any of these things you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might</font>

284
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,260
not have completely prevented it but at

285
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,760
least they would have had some early

286
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,350
detection so we can't create a list of

287
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,740
complete list of failures here because

288
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:22,040
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the rest of this talk but</font>

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were general areas of failures the</font>

290
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,079
application there was a obscure but

highly vulnerable PHP application on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

292
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,589
network there was far too much

of network failures but there is threat

335
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,790

did start with the web service this did

339
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,230
start with that PHP server that allowed

340
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,349
them to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web root and then work</font>

341
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:26,030
their way further in so this did start

342
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:28,490
with apps here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing application</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">SDLC just like QA it's not something you</font>

351
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,300
required to do that successfully or very

352
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,709
different as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as infosec we are</font>

353
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,560
looking for this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the similar</font>

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,119
is to do to handle this problem properly

356
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,030
are very fundamentally different so

357
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,670
there is wisdom to gain from mature QA

or<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec program but they cannot lay</font>

360
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:10,580
application security is its own thing so

361
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,189
how should an enterprise manage this

362
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,230
kind of application risk suppose we're

363

in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a combination</font>

be doing so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a gross</font>

373
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,540
oversimplification of some of the roles

within<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

so executive leadership the sea level

development and<font color="#E5E5E5"> production ops so</font>

380
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:59,610
development obviously must adopt secure

design coding and testing the production

382
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,149
ops people<font color="#E5E5E5"> must monitor production</font>

systems maintain a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardened environment</font>

00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:09,230
and respond to incidents makes it sound

385
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:14,670
easy but as we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is quite not easy</font>

386
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:16,139
but executive leadership must provide

387
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,099
the motive and means that make the

388
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,120
program possible very important and

389
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,519
security leadership must address

immediate risk by assessing production

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,500
and managing known vulnerabilities and

392
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,269
they must<font color="#E5E5E5"> also provide guidance and</font>

00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,579
metrics that tie all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these other</font>

practices together<font color="#E5E5E5"> theirs is the biggest</font>

396
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:41,759
bring these practices together these are

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,550
just groups of practices<font color="#E5E5E5"> this obviously</font>

00:16:51,269 --> 00:17:00,899
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can slice this out you know</font>

402
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:04,168
however however a program is not easily

403
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,909
adopted you know executives have to

404
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:07,559
worry about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the budget</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and justifying the budget that they're</font>

407
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,928
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to just say I need to throw</font>

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">security leadership is going to have</font>

414
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,510
out what's worth the limited time and

420
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,320
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what they normally deal</font>

421
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,780
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> day-to-day these are people who</font>

422
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,428
deal with the tax regularly but they

423
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,000
don't know how to recognize application

424
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:51,980
attacks so in excuses when challenges

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,169
come excuse

426
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,780
soon follow these are all quotes we've

427
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,340
heard over the years we are into a

428
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,860
security company or it said we're

429
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,629
compliance attackers won't bother with

430
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:09,409
this well we haven't been compromised

431
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:11,720
yet really why worry now so the case for

432
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,760
an SS a program is big a problem as this

433
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,610
is the situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to be</font>

434
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,049
confusing and overwhelming iterative

435
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,510
measurable progress within a

436
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:24,520
comprehensive plan can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an</font>

437
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,520
enterprise mature while keeping positive

438
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,160
so here's some here's some key elements

accountable for success it's the old

there's an old African proverb at the

the goat owned in common always stars if

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,530
a program<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to clearly define what</font>

your organization is starting from

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,510
suggest changing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDLC network</font>

architects will suggest hardening the

perimeter testers will suggest running

assessments and executives will suggest

operational deployment process the

500
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,100
things that these suggestions have in

501
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:50,139
common is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is people leaning on</font>

502
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,760
what they already know right they're not

503
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:53,799
necessarily making decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on</font>

what needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

505

they're making that decision based on

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay what am i less like least likely to</font>

507
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:02,380
mess up<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now much like a cat will</font>

508
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,658
try to solve every problem with teeth

509
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and claws people will lean back on what</font>

510
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:14,260
they know so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things</font>

511
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:15,879
prematurely so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get all let's</font>

512
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,010
get a full program let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a whole</font>

513
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,409
framework going but let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

514
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">some foundation let's build some needed</font>

515
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:25,389
foundations we want to build some

516
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,820
foundations because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address</font>

517
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:31,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> amok the most immediate risks in the</font>

518
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:33,639
short-term focus focus on practices that

519
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,459
compliment on another one another

520
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:41,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually and give your staff the Intel</font>

521
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,710
and capability to succeed so typical

522
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:47,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">enterprise your company what's the most</font>

523
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:52,410
pressing application security problem

524
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:56,370
not a trick<font color="#CCCCCC"> question do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

525
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:59,400
rebel yeah what problems am I sitting on

526
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,169
right now right that's your most

527
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,970
pressing immediate problem wherever you

528
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:06,600
are that's the most first concern so why

529
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,580
not why don't we start with that let's

530
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at what potential risks I'm sitting</font>

531
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">on right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now and let's fully address</font>

532
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,030
those first I'll elaborate on these and

533
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:18,240
it elaborate on it visa on these in a

534
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,560
bit so find in fix once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have shown</font>

535
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,230
that you're capable of finding and

536
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,020
fixing educate your developers your ops

537
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:27,750
your leaders your architects scope out

538
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,700
the program let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hold of what our</font>

539
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">goals are and how big this program is</font>

540
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to have to be and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finally tie</font>

541
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,770
those all together into your mission

542
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,900
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be whether it be for the next</font>

543
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">year or whether it be multiple years out</font>

544
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:47,730
then we tie all those things together so

545
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's start with finding and fixing for</font>

546
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,530
most organizations assessing

547
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:57,990
applications first is better short-term

548
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:59,940
and long-term now and I bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this</font>

549
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,730
point because a lot of times we came

550
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:07,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">into we come into enterprises we come</font>

551
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:09,450
into teams that may make the decision

552
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,190
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a mix of legacy</font>

553
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,200
applications and active development and

554
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,390
they make the decision well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

555
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,820
change the sdlc first because that's our

556
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,990
new development those are going to be

557
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,520
art those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be some important</font>

558
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,440
applications and vulnerabilities are

559
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,820
much cheaper to fix if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing an</font>

560
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,100
early development those are all things

561
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,330
are all true<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what are some what are</font>

562
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">some drawbacks to that line of reasoning</font>

563
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:33,330
if you start changing up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps and</font>

564
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,379
how they do their day-to-day what you

565
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,199
know if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in with</font>

566
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,630
changes on how they do their day-to-day

567
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:46,410
business what are those developers going

568
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:49,410
to demand of you leave or explain

569
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:51,120
yourself right the problem with going

570
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,310
straight into the sdlc and we do see

571
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,489
this like we'll go in and we'll look and

572
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:58,080
see oh hey you just started assessing

573
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,930
applications but you've had coding

574
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,550
standards for

575
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,040
years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go look at in a minutes</font>

576
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,600
they got like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that owasp SCP and they</font>

577
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,149
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up on their SharePoint portal</font>

578
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,340
and none of the devs know it exists

579
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,230
nobody looks at it because they haven't

580
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,419
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reason to care that it's even</font>

581
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,280
there right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because here's the thing in</font>

582
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,050
a program if you have to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dig</font>

583
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,520
through some obscure portal or dig out

584
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,720
of your filing cabinet to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the piece</font>

585
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:26,379
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper is it a working policy no no</font>

586
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,450
it's not it doesn't count so for more so

587
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,220
most organizations assessing apps is

588
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,950
better in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> short term and the long</font>

589
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,960
term assessing your apps first can

590
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,420
expose exploitable flaws in your

591
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-value Production apps that is</font>

592
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,680
obviously very important provide real

593
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:45,520
data to validate the need for security

594
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,410
to leadership and testers and operations

595
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,139
team can see what vulnerabilities and

596
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:53,020
exploits look like in their environment

597
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,700
it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to just give general</font>

598
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,470
teaching and show them my application

599
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,510
security is cool and while yet the

600
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,740
exploits look cool it's another thing to

601
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,020
kind of show them okay here's the

602
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,690
general exploit and oh and by the way I

603
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,310
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your application here's a</font>

604
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,990
here's injection in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your application</font>

605
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,389
here's here's a fishing off of your

606
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:13,930
application the last the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last training I</font>

607
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:16,690
did I actually it was for a company in

608
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,460
Nevada I was a you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know doing all this</font>

609
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,050
training and I was you know as I was

610
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">showing the individual vulnerabilities I</font>

611
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,560
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling up his one team's</font>

612
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,120
architecture documentation in kind of

613
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,320
showing them all the how the

614
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,350
vulnerability is applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their</font>

615
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,030
environment there was like four or five

616
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,590
teams in there the next day he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like</font>

617
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,149
was I the only guy who gave you my

618
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,679
architecture documentation because

619
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:39,370
you're picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on me a lot it was like</font>

620
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes sorry you were you did a good job of</font>

621
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,479
providing information and had to punish

622
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:47,800
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> by embarrassing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you in in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front of</font>

623
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,180
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what</font>

624
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,680
these vulnerabilities look like because

625
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that goes towards the end of</font>

626
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,840
understanding what are our most

627
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,729
immediate problems you know if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

628
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,500
if your vulnerabilities are just a

629
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,000
handful of like tiny little oversights

630
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,620
and your encoding and so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

631
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,260
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one cross-site scripting but it's</font>

632
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,580
not everywhere then okay then<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you</font>

633
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,379
just need to do some assessments from

634
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,960
time to time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I start seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> broad</font>

635
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,910
swath of like no access control you use

636
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,150
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

637
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:17,310
js2<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use your note js2 kind of</font>

638
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,260
determine what role somebody is when the

639
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:21,300
access your services well those are

640
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,220
signs of deep-seated lack of knowledge

641
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and your developers in your architects</font>

642
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,570
and so now you understand what's more

643
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,040
important so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Intel</font>

644
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:33,060
you're going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> from just running</font>

645
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,460
some assessments first so how to do this

646
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,409
identify your top two to five apps it's

647
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,330
an informal process everybody knows what

648
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,430
their top two to five applications are

649
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:45,360
we don't need to get formal with our

650
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:46,770
application risk rating yet discover

651
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,610
Mulder abilities communicate the

652
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,350
findings and verify remediation well

653
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,350
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know can this</font>

654
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,149
process work in to end at all you're

655
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,850
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know well are they</font>

656
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,020
going to ignore your request for fixes

657
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,159
when you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them something to fix are</font>

658
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,110
they just going to respond in middle

659
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,700
fingers or are they actually going to

660
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,669
fix it are they going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it and be</font>

661
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,980
salty about it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

662
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,870
do they care because whether or not they

663
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,370
care is going to determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

664
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">not you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to bring some sort of</font>

665
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,449
authoritarian mandate into the picture

666
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,160
you don't want to have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

667
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,470
want everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on board and just</font>

668
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,630
make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen but we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen all kinds</font>

669
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,370
we've been to very large enterprises

670
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,410
where you don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have an</font>

671
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:31,320
executive mandate to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> things because</font>

672
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:33,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture is such that they will get</font>

673
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,649
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> done all you have to do is show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

674
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,899
what the problem is make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they</font>

675
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,490
understand it and developers are smart

676
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,070
people they can figure out fixes with a

677
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,900
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of help will it can test the</font>

678
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,030
findings with assumptions outside their

679
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,620
domain are they going to say well yeah

680
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,230
but nobody's going to exploit this

681
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,330
because there's a VPN connection well if

682
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,920
a developer says that well the controls

683
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,960
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your services are</font>

684
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,640
not your business you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume</font>

685
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's been compromised in if you</font>

686
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,200
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that conversation then this</font>

687
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">is Intel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need right now if you have</font>

688
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,570
to have those kinds of conversations

689
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,220
will they implement incorrect fixes

690
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,960
without consulting somebody with

691
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,090
appropriate expertise that's another

692
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,100
piece of information we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to know do</font>

693
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,480
they know who they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn to going</font>

694
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,209
through this process is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach</font>

695
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,950
us that if the process doesn't work you

696
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,370
have other problems to solve before you

697
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,789
can move forward so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

698
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,539
make sure you

699
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:29,158
have an order before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you move on so with</font>

700
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this foundation you've got knowledge of</font>

701
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,519
and fixes for your highest profile

702
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,799
vulnerabilities real data to validate

703
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,350
the need for secure dev<font color="#CCCCCC"> into inform</font>

704
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,908
training and insight into the nature of

705
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,100
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> flaws and how developers address</font>

706
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:44,100
them all good stuff so you have

707
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,859
assessments what<font color="#E5E5E5"> next developers must</font>

708
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,189
understand the importance in nature of

709
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:51,749
functional application security with

710
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,369
assessments in hand you can strengthen

711
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:54,960
your training with real data like I just

712
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:57,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about it's one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to teach</font>

713
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,830
them about vulnerabilities it's another

714
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to teach them about vulnerabilities and</font>

715
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,129
then pull up<font color="#E5E5E5"> their source code in front</font>

716
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,369
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and show them give them a reason</font>

717
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:06,449
to care developers again they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

718
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get your training they're going to</font>

719
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,899
understand you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them a</font>

720
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason to care security awareness</font>

721
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:16,590
training is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough what topic should</font>

722
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:18,869
I cover in our domain of application

723
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,908
security training I bring this up

724
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:23,129
because one common pitfall we see is

725
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:27,169
well i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach the OWASP top 10</font>

726
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:29,580
is the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 a cool wonderful thing yes</font>

727
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:36,080
does the 0 is the OWASP top 10

728
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:38,789
appropriate for a standard know why not

729
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,580
it's just top 10 it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a list of</font>

730
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:43,830
fun facts right it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of what are</font>

731
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,408
some interesting common vulnerabilities

732
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,119
the whole point of the top 10 is to get

733
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,649
people interested and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to care</font>

734
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,349
and it works it's lonely serves that

735
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:54,330
purpose the problem is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

736
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:56,249
take the next step and start building

00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">their standards off of it they start you</font>

738
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:59,700
know setting their code scan filters

739
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:02,639
based on the OAuth top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 they start</font>

740
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,259
using it as a baseline for their actual

741
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:05,609
functional security because that's all

742
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:08,340
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to wrap their hands</font>

743
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:10,199
around so there but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

744
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,119
doing is your full set of functional

application security requirements and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0</font>

747
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:20,129
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all they put that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in front</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

748
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:21,659
you some other training pitbulls I think

749
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:25,320
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> session with the purple team</font>

750
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:26,669
made this very<font color="#E5E5E5"> same point because we run</font>

751
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,408
into this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time the time I just</font>

752
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">want my developers to write secure code</font>

753
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:32,549
not know how to attack applications

754
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,619
that's a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I don't want them</font>

755
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:35,999
hacking myself I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want them to know</font>

756
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:36,809
what the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> code is supposed to</font>

757
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:41,580
look like what's the

758
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:43,678
back of that why is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to teach</font>

759
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,259
teach of developers we work with like

760
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,210
how to attack your stuff there's wisdom

761
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:56,009
in that what what what is one of the

762
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:57,389
benefits of that yeah like<font color="#CCCCCC"> new you first</font>

763
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they they want you want them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

764
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:01,649
understand why these things are problems

765
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,939
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want that knowledge in the</font>

766
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:05,248
wisdom<font color="#CCCCCC"> they get from that training to</font>

767
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,659
translate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> other domains you don't</font>

768
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:08,009
want to teach them something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

769
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,929
away the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very moment they change</font>

770
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:11,659
platforms or frameworks or write a new

771
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:14,369
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> app or go from web to mobile</font>

772
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:16,139
right you want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand what</font>

773
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:18,720
risk really is what it looks like get

774
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:21,240
them a little scared let them see that

775
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,999
actually attacking applications is not

776
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,529
that difficult the strength<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bring into this situation is app</font>

778
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:30,539
security professionals is our experience

<font color="#CCCCCC">in our in our like mindset that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we take</font>

780
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,658
when we approach these applications and

781
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,939
the ability to manage the complexity

782
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,950
that comes with assessing an application

783
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what we bring to it it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

784
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,999
the it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the attacks we do or</font>

785
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,158
just beyond their depth that's not the

786
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:45,629
case developers are smart people they'll

787
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,879
get it if we give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a compelling</font>

00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:50,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to and so it is in our best</font>

789

interest to teach them what attackers do

790
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:53,549
and to make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">own standards but however you do it</font>

799
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,998
there is some essential content you're

800
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,070
going to need in your standards so

801
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,470
solutions for functional security

802
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,418
requirements what are functional

803
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,860
security requirements these guys these

804
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,019
are functional security requirements

805
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,789
right what do you do for authentication

806
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:28,710
that's a functional security requirement

807
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:30,059
will you do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your output encoding and</font>

808
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,429
scaping validation those are all

809
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:34,289
functional security requirements so your

810
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard should have solutions for those</font>

811
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:40,289
things code configuration and other

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:43,889
that's actionable a<font color="#CCCCCC"> blacklist is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

870
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,050
it is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules and policies by in for</font>

871
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,730
more mature practices and cooperation

872
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,290
between security and development we

873
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:56,219
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a healthy relationship</font>

874
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,870
between the two and scoping is something

875
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,240
that we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> in parallel with</font>

876
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:02,640
educating our developers and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> parallel</font>

877
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,149
with more finding and fixing

878
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:13,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">program scope and strategic imperative</font>

879
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:15,660
so so gather the application portfolio

880
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:17,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">Enterprise leadership must allocate</font>

881
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,339
limited resources for tools and

882
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:22,049
assessments so the security leadership

883
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:24,509
must gather the data to inform those

884
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:26,880
decisions what are the applications

885
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,500
technical and business profiles what

886
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,900
language do they use how big is it what

887
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,930
frameworks leverage also like who is it

888
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,000
for who is it exposed to this is the

889
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,490
time early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to gather that</font>

890
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,160
information there's all sorts of reasons

891
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,180
we want to do that why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

892
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,578
consider everything remember target

893
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:52,529
target was a was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breach</font>

894
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:55,980
started with a exploit of a obscure PHP

895
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:57,869
portal for contractors I guarantee you

896
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,119
they did not think to apply any security

897
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:01,980
scrutiny to it because their thinking

898
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,890
was well this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for the partner</font>

899
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:08,359
portal nobody uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing so I</font>

900
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:11,759
clearly target com is far more important

901
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:13,140
but they failed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to account for several</font>

902
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:15,930
things when they made that decision they

903
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:21,240
didn't account for access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sensitive</font>

904
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:23,910
assets and they didn't they also didn't

905
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:27,180
take into account if it allows elevation

906
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:29,220
of privilege within the enterprise so

907
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,839
they didn't consider all the factors

908
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into the decision about whether</font>

909
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:35,430
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they should apply some security</font>

910
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,200
scrutiny to this thing before using it

911
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:42,058
in a wild so if you're gathering your

912
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,058
portfolio just a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

913
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:47,130
pitfalls is too well if you've already

914
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:49,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">got your inventory centrally controlled</font>

915
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:53,579
that's great wonderful you may need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

916
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,480
ensure its complete but great now of

917
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,910
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're one hundred percent</font>

918
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,569
complete list is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always feasible but</font>

919
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:02,399
the mistake we often see is to get an

920
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:04,859
application list is just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

921
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,420
different lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> business like hey</font>

922
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,788
your job is to know it all the apps are

923
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,589
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a list and you know what they'll</font>

924
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:12,509
do is they'll just get out a you know a

925
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:14,369
dry erase marker and start like writing

926
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:16,700
down names on a board what's the problem

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

928

00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,100
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> person is not going to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

930
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if they start doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

931
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that like writing down their list</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of apps on a whiteboard what that means</font>

00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have that list sorted soft</font>

934
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:39,060
copy somewhere and they really should so

935
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,130
you should go<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward so so you you want</font>

941
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,339
data what we like to do is then go

backward<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right if we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roof yes</font>

970
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:12,240
here's one last time we did one of these

reviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a product they used SD</font>

973
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">would actually take the technical</font>

974
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:19,349
profile you would give it like what it

975
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:21,930
does who it's for what kind of data

976
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:23,430
handles and one it's a place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

977
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,839
keeps your inventory into if you like

978
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,160
plug it into your change management

979
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:28,740
system it'll start like creating

980
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,089
assessment tracks like you know you give

981
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,308
it the parameters and you'll say hey

982
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:33,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this application in case you forgot</font>

983
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it you should assess it once a</font>

984
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,470
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can put in things like</font>

985
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:40,640
if it detects that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been updating</font>

986
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:43,140
it a lot then you can you know

987
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,660
accelerate further assessments or make

988
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,000
it part of the release cycle ideally we

989
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,680
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> both right in the last</font>

990
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,210
session was about integrating security

991
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,629
into the sdlc and we want to use

992
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:58,049
continuous integration for our up for

993
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,819
our new development but there's two

994
00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:02,430
reasons you want to do full assessments

995
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:04,259
one you have legacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not part of</font>

996
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,779
that continuous integration process

997
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,579
right well three reasons there's got

998
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,779
there's products you can't do the

999
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,450
continuous integration because you don't

1000
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:13,859
own it it's someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else who built it if</font>

1001
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,118
you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like if you're</font>

1002
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:17,339
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1003
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,779
ASAP<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know somebody assesses</font>

1004
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:21,029
that but if it's like a more obscure

1005
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:22,500
niche product you might be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

1006
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">people actually care about the security</font>

1007
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,900
for it so you might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lean on</font>

1008
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:30,089
assessments for that in addition the and

1009
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,069
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally there are a level of</font>

1010
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:33,630
security tests that really do require

1011
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:36,930
manual review and I'm sure a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1012
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:39,690
previous classes in this conference have

1013
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,700
touched on what those things are and one

1014
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,289
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and we worked with one</font>

1015
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,640
company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had it solution like how do</font>

1016
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:46,799
I make the decision what do I fully

1017
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,210
assess versus what do I rely on on

1018
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:50,190
continuous integration and what they

1019
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,680
would do is that they would run scans

1020
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,930
and then what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you you give</font>

1021
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,480
them data to create a heat map of what

1022
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,339
applications justify the closer manual

1023
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,039
review and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people have to deal</font>

1024
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">with literally thousands of apps so in</font>

1025
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">your scope establish your goals so your</font>

1026
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,940
goals do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come from executive</font>

1027
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,819
leadership not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> security otherwise</font>

1028
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,380
you're not going to have

1029
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:16,479
the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> compelling mandate so set</font>

1030
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,920
set those goals how many apps should

1031
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:20,799
your program cover within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next year</font>

1032
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,420
or your app subject to PCI DSS or other

1033
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:25,719
compliance drivers and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often should</font>

1034
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,009
you assess<font color="#CCCCCC"> your highest risk apps so</font>

1035
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,349
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some things to consider</font>

1036
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:30,789
when you're setting your goals but with

1037
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:32,739
this foundation you've got your goals

1038
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:34,839
you have the known gap between your

1039
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:36,549
policy and practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have a</font>

profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl throughout the</font>

1041
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:40,660
organization and believe very

1042
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:42,999
importantly you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your portfolio you</font>

1043
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,098
are now getting an idea of how big<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1044
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:47,558
program is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know</font>

1045
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:49,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">how goals to compare those two because</font>

1046
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,670
there might be some figuring out that

1047
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:54,759
needs to happen if what the executives

1048
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:56,559
are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide and how big of a</font>

1049
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:58,690
how big of a scope your program needs to

1050
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,069
have if there's a big disconnect this is

1051
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,359
the time to figure that out before you

1052
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:03,459
start actually building a road map

1053
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:06,249
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you otherwise you're building a</font>

1054
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:08,859
road map that cannot succeed so anyway

1055
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:11,288
once once you devil those together it is

1056
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,410
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your mission this is the time</font>

1057
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:17,140
to consider adopting an SS a framework

1058
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:18,519
such as open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam Microsoft stld sim I'm</font>

1059
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:23,199
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> several of these were mentioned</font>

1060
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:25,359
during this conference open Sam divides

1061
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,309
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> activities into you know for</font>

1062
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:32,769
business functions with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice neat</font>

1063
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:35,319
three act three practices each this is

1064
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:37,390
an open model<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Microsoft sdl is very</font>

1065
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:39,249
much focused<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your change control</font>

1066
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:41,499
process all the different things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

1067
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:46,390
be doing for security in your dev

sigil based a solution that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works very</font>

1070
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:56,859
similar to open Sam in that it has your

1071
00:42:52,690 --> 00:43:00,640
four areas of practice with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a three with</font>

1072
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:02,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">three practices under each category so</font>

1073
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,779
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different advantages and</font>

1074
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:08,819
disadvantages to consider when adopting

1075
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:11,170
these things the important thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1076
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:14,109
you need to consider your foundations

1077
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:16,319
first and important things to consider

1078
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:18,848
is that once you have done these

1079
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,469
foundations you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a much</font>

1080
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,039
better idea what framework is

1081
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,779
appropriate

1082
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,640
for you it's better<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do those</font>

1083
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:28,089
foundations you don't need a framework

1084
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,589
at the very beginning so again assign a

1085
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:31,569
charter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of responsibilities who's</font>

1086
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:32,828
responsible are they capable to succeed

1087
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:37,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the resources</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1088
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:39,459
succeed so I'll just make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick point</font>

1089
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:42,009
about metrics since we're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1090
00:43:39,459 --> 00:43:44,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit low on time this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

1091
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:46,029
common metric I you know we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see like</font>

1092
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:49,479
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security leadership give to the</font>

1093
00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:50,890
executives because hey I had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1094
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:52,479
vulnerabilities and now I have fewer

1095
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:56,618
vulnerabilities what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fail to</font>

1096
00:43:52,479 --> 00:44:00,189
convey risk this is not count for risk

1097
00:43:56,619 --> 00:44:02,199
right there is blindness here so what

1098
00:44:00,189 --> 00:44:04,178
you want to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also give</font>

1099
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:06,119
metrics that put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your overall risk this</font>

1100
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:08,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what we we will do from time to time</font>

1101
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,019
these are the vulnerabilities I know

1102
00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:13,479
about if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I compare if i extrapolate that</font>

1103
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:15,640
data onto my entire application

1104
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:19,739
portfolio things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scanned or</font>

1105
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessed yet I'm fixing the stuff but</font>

1106
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:25,329
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of other things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1107
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:27,909
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know discover as this</font>

1108
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,739
program grows so you want to use metrics

1109
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:31,779
like this to communicate the need to

1110
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:33,429
executives that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this program needs to</font>

1111
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:37,179
grow because there is more risk that I

1112
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:40,299
still in potentially sitting on so your

1113
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:42,249
roadmap it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea for your</font>

1114
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:45,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">roadmap to just plan out the next year</font>

1115
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:48,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">or so don't don't try to make like a</font>

1116
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">five-year plan yet make a year plan make</font>

1117
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:51,630
sure you can meet that your plan and

1118
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you maybe get get a little more</font>

1119
00:44:51,630 --> 00:45:03,069
sophisticated so just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

1120
00:44:56,859 --> 00:45:05,019
let's see so security leadership does

1121
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:06,999
have the biggest role this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a rather</font>

1122
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:08,828
robust list we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to go</font>

1123
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:10,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">over this entire list that's this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1124
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:13,509
normally something we talked about over

1125
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:16,449
two days I'm sure a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font>

1126
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:20,159
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered in the in the other other</font>

1127
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:23,799
other sessions for this a conference so

1128
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,869
but some some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick out here</font>

1129
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:27,549
is you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty obvious</font>

1130
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:29,309
assessing production vulnerability

1131
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:31,479
management also pretty straightforward

1132
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:34,119
risk intelligence we talked about the

1133
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,540
portfolio as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> measurement we</font>

1134
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,330
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1135
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,520
that but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing receiving public</font>

1136
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,930
finds make sure you have a solution for

1137
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,360
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody finds a vulnerability</font>

1138
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:46,509
in the wild who do they talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

1139
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:50,710
sure you have an answer for that let's

1140
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:53,380
talk about secure coding in design I

1141
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:55,420
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had a discussion earlier</font>

1142
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:59,460
about threat modeling and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the challenges</font>

1143
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:01,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that come with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it threat modeling is</font>

1144
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,680
something you may want to consider

1145
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,390
getting some practice for early on

1146
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">because threat modeling proper threat</font>

1147
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:10,810
modeling is very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> data flow</font>

1148
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:12,190
diagrams make it easy to start and you

1149
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good data at the start</font>

1150
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,120
but making a complete threat model is

1151
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,380
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person who</font>

1152
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:21,759
builds it has to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think like a</font>

1153
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:24,340
developer and architect and a network

1154
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,900
ops person and there are not a lot of

1155
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who can do that I'm not one of</font>

1156
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:32,640
them like I'm short on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network ops</font>

1157
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:35,590
side of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we cannot exclude ops</font>

1158
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,390
we can't expect the production team to

1159
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:39,730
be application<font color="#E5E5E5"> experts but they should</font>

1160
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,040
know when to recognize application

1161
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:44,050
problems mitigate vulnerabilities and

1162
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,660
escalate to developers as a pro as

1163
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:48,010
appropriate we had a one o'clock talk

1164
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,049
just across the hall that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about</font>

1165
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:52,060
specifically that and how they would

1166
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:54,640
separate logs that belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the AB</font>

1167
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,660
developers and logs it belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them so</font>

1168
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,060
that they could detect malicious

1169
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,500
activity and verify that it actually is

1170
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:02,410
malicious and not something intended

1171
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,970
you're in trouble so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion assa</font>

1172
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,490
is a challenge in managing risk in

1173
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:08,290
complexity this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple</font>

1174
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenge but it is a manageable one</font>

1175
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:13,480
quick early wins or useful short term

1176
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:15,340
and long term get your pro s<font color="#E5E5E5"> sa program</font>

1177
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,760
goals scope and charter in order before

1178
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:20,740
taking the big steps and a proper SS a

1179
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,410
framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> like open Sam will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> critical</font>

1180
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,629
to grow but you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

1181
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:27,990
one and that's and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important</font>

1182
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:34,210
part getting started is the hardest<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

1183
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:36,290
that's it any questions and

1184
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,910
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be providing them to last</font>
