00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,520
good afternoon everybody i'm glad you

00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,720
could attend my talk I know it is

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,280
getting late in the day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,630
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a load of information</font>

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,300
so I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of keep this</font>

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,250
light-hearted informational and just

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,330
have a good time please there's a going

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,980
to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> section for answering our</font>

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,940
question answer at the end but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,769
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really want to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ask by all means raise your hand I'll</font>

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,100
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and address it we only have a period</font>

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,160
of time so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we</font>

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,950
get through the presentation as was

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,500
communicating the introduction the topic

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,500
of the conversation is could a few lines

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,510
of code it all up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of</font>

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,519
looking at some aspects you may bought

20
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,710
not be thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,760
developing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in open source so more than</font>

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety percent of commercial</font>

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,220
applications make use of open source

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:10,550
software open source software is great

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,470
but you're always concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

26
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,640
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I'm going to get into</font>

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,039
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more as we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,600
conversation today but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the major</font>

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,509
open source packages that people are

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">using nodejs it's quickly becoming a</font>

31
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:25,100
leading framework but there's some

32
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,289
issues with the repository in the way

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,160
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used in communicated and</font>

34
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:35,869
downloaded by the consumers of the

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:39,199
technology if you will so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do not know</font>

36
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:40,910
how to totally pronounce this person's

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,950
name right I get take a guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia</font>

38
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,780
kakhulu is what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

39
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,470
anyone have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other alternative</font>

40
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,660
spellings or pronunciations no you can't

41
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,580
get creative if you want well there's a

42
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,149
story associated with this this is a

43
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:59,080
fairly anonymous developer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font>

44
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:02,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> liberate his modules following a</font>

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,349
disagreement with NPM staff who knows

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,060
what NPM we're going to talk about it

47
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:10,098
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> who knows what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mpm is very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

48
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,750
he got into a fight with node package

49
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,880
manner and said fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm taking my ball</font>

50
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going home his ball being his coat</font>

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,120
you should fall as an example there he

52
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:24,739
takes his code and goes home among them

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,939
was a module named left<font color="#CCCCCC"> pat ok he takes</font>

54
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,909
his code how does that affect other

55
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:31,069
people how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically may be</font>

56
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:33,048
hurt as was<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned some of the major</font>

57
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,298
organizations in the world this obscure

58
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:37,909
developer nobody's ever heard of takes

59
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:42,379
his code and goes home and there's huge

60
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:46,280
ramifications when somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> was trying</font>

61
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use an apple you know a package left</font>

62
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,079
had was a dependency and it would cause

63
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,540
things to go awry if you can see you get

64
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:59,030
all sorts of error messages it's missing

65
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,950
let that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gone it's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer a</font>

66
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,129
dependency that the code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

67
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,418
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use is looking for so</font>

68
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,730
highlight this and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're</font>

69
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,699
kind of going with this conversation

70
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:12,108
left pad is not an in the NPM registry

71
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,090
you should bug the author to<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish it</font>

72
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:18,519
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you bug him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always want he took it</font>

73
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,480
and went home or use the name yourself

74
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,169
anybody know the ramifications of that

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,000
and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> NPM works it's only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the name</font>

76
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:29,780
is the identifying piece so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if somebody</font>

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">else wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to upload into NPM something</font>

78
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,079
called left had everything would then

79
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,290
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> consume that there's no versioning</font>

80
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,519
there's no specific mapping to something

81
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">else so somebody else could basically</font>

82
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,949
just say up it's gone i'm going to put

83
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,479
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there and they could put whatever</font>

84
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,909
code they wanted in that piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

85
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:47,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">that piece of download very very</font>

86
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:51,620
dangerous in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept so what this</font>

87
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:54,349
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> did was left pad was used by over</font>

88
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">40</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mpm modules so immediately there were</font>

89
00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:00,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">40 modules that people were using</font>

90
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">including the two-parent of reactant in</font>

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,229
Babel were used by Facebook and Airbnb

92
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,298
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> many others these at these apps just</font>

93
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">broke they started to look for that</font>

94
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,349
missing component and they broke this

95
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,679
actually triggered a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> conceptual</font>

96
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,570
interesting conversation about how can

97
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,909
this guy just take his coat he put it

98
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,250
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for use as part of an open</font>

99
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:23,750
source package and it's gone how can

100
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,400
this happen shouldn't ought to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

101
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,560
to unpublish his work without a process

102
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,349
what happens to the available module

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,000
names again everything is mapped by

104
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:33,320
their name and if somebody takes it out

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,639
and it's gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody could jump right</font>

106
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,469
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put the same name in there</font>

107
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,030
so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're getting</font>

108
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:40,460
sometimes you have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very cautious</font>

109
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,448
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dependencies in the</font>

110
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,448
availability to the code

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,240
now we'll talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> npm platform as</font>

112
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,070
was mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> the npm platform is in the</font>

113
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:59,060
upper<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand corner mpm no JS</font>

114
00:04:52,070 --> 00:05:01,250
package manager it is primarily the main

115
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,740
point or managing of open source

116
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,780
packages associated with no<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeaious you</font>

117
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,130
can find share reuse packages of code

118
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,070
from hundreds of thousands of developers

119
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,620
and there's around 300,000 modules

120
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,450
available it's a lot of code to choose

121
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,370
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of things you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to</font>

122
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,210
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself why do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to reinvent</font>

123
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,330
the wheel when somebody's already

124
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,770
created the wheel for you much easier to

125
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,539
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else's work as long as it's</font>

126
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,909
tested as long as it's used

127
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:31,000
appropriately from thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

128
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,980
too around a hundred thousand of these

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,520
modules have no dependencies they are

130
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:42,470
what they are however 200,000 of them

131
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:45,560
actually have dependencies some of them

132
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,000
have many dependencies one of the

133
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,979
biggest numbers we saw on our research

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">single modules that have more than</font>

135
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:55,520
80,000 dependencies you got to think

136
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that that's complexity complexity</font>

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,510
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give some examples of you</font>

may not perceive how many dependencies

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,469
are actually happening when you download

140
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,479
a there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> b c d e f there's many</font>

different modules that basically could

142
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:11,810
be dangerous we're going to talk about

143
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:15,260
how this can be dangerous one of the

144
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:21,370
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by 10pm semantic</font>

there's no control over<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

it is it basically publishes it and then

anybody can download that and if the

212
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,550
example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just something to think</font>

213
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,459
about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually are using</font>

214
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,579

215
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,050
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is especially if you're not</font>

216
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,089
actually a developer and you're actually

217
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,069
managing teams this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something you</font>

218
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:11,399
should ask your team's think about this

219
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,769
so for example

220
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:18,279
there's a package called active

221
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:25,540
directory it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> for authentication pretty</font>

222
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:29,019
much ldap authentication for auth it had

223
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,310
around 13,000 downloads last month this

224
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,690
is this presentation that might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

225
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to date with last month when I Kirk</font>

226
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,820
when the presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> was committed</font>

227
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,570
created that was the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> number a lot</font>

228
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:43,300
of downloads and then to think about it

229
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,180
it has four dependencies that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

230
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,750
lists<font color="#CCCCCC"> for dependencies you think that's</font>

231
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,430
the actual value dependencies it has

232
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,870
this is where the the scary aspects of

233
00:09:51,430 --> 00:10:00,339
knowing what is in your code really

234
00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens for dependencies if I click this</font>

235
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:06,550
this is the install it's a little

236
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,420
animation here this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me it</font>

237
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work in a slide presentation</font>

238
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,519
well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an animation of the</font>

239
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,380
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a basic all this chunk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

240
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,579
data pops down and there's a big chunk

241
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,100
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data you don't understand what it is</font>

242
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:26,519
but hey it works it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work it's</font>

243
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:29,170
in there that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> light so this little</font>

244
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,890
interesting math<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 plus 10 plus four</font>

245
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:37,240
plus one equals 19 query the audience

246
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:40,709
what do you think that means well we

247
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,709
know for there's four dependencies

248
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:47,199
there's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> r4 dependencies bill</font>

249
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,180
directly from a go there's our four

250
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:50,229
dependencies and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

251
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,859
quick and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about one of</font>

252
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,860
the tendencies

253
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,600
each one of these dependencies has

254
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,950
multiple dependencies one of the

255
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:08,310
dependencies is this very<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique small</font>

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:24,090
this so we'll do the same thing 30

259
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:29,340
million downloads because of all the

260

dependencies that using it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:39,660
dependencies so it's consumed it doesn't

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually consume anything and it has</font>

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,550
preview example with left pad imagine if

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,140
this one was taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how many modules</font>

266
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,760
how many how much code in the world

267
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,980
would break if this was removed and

268
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,480
again with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concern about</font>

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,280
semantic versioning all that really

271
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">takes effect on many different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> types of</font>

272
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,160
application so again a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple lines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

273
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,740
code really could mess everything up

274
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,579
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a couple lines of code</font>

275
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:15,390

276
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,980
pretty important not that somebody

277
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,340
couldn't do this that by themselves very

278
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,510
very quickly but that's all it does so

279
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:26,070
if somebody was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

code this this low dash out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ndm it</font>

281
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,940
would cause a lot of havoc for a lot of

282
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,750
companies so a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines of code</font>

283
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,370
could really mess everything up

284
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:43,560
questions up to this point a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

285
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:46,410
head-shaking and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> already talked about</font>

286
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,609
90,000 89 90 90 s a bigger number

287
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,060
everyone gets impressed by bigger

288
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:55,410
numbers so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some potential</font>

289
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:58,530
scenarios you could create a useful

290
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,930
module do some good old marketing push

291
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,970
your module make it sound like it's the

292
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,069
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing since sliced bread it does</font>

293
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,590
the most amazing computation it saves

294
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,019
you time it does all these things it

295
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,179
gets a mass adoption

296
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,480
hello dash and then you update it you

297
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:17,399
change it for maybe your own personal

298
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,199
gain maybe financial gain maybe you just

299
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:25,110
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with people but it is</font>

300
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:26,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible you could create a module with</font>

301
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,809
a similar name it was a security

302
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">researcher that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a research project</font>

306
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:46,529
the name a little bit one letter tons of

307
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:50,128
people downloaded it thinking it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

308
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:52,619
actual coffee script you have to make

309
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:55,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you know what you're downloading it</font>

310
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:59,549
was widely widely successful research

311
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:04,230
project by a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher on how</font>

312
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:07,049
to potentially leverage npm taking over

313
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,029
control of the legit account somebody

314
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:10,410
walks away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the workstation you know</font>

315
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,369
what you're doing you know you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

316
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,549
upload<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what the name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

317
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:17,639
something is you could very easily take

318
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:25,170
over legit account and publish dangerous

319
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:26,699
code questionable code<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecure code now</font>

320
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,009
we go that was malicious somewhat

321
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,139
actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something now we</font>

322
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:32,699
go to careless so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about</font>

323
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:36,540
the inheritance of the dependencies and

324
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:38,189
how far down the chain they are so

325
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,779
everybody take a look at this block of

326
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:42,420
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know everybody is maybe not a</font>

327
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,160
coder but think about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

328
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:53,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially the vulnerability in this</font>

329
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:56,779
block of code any any any comments any

330
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,779
any ideas

331
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,639
yeah it's a potential denial service

332
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,229
attack because you're checking for that

333
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,320
loop with the null byte but you're not

334
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">checking for any type of size limitation</font>

335
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,339
so we're going to talk about this and

336
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we found some of</font>

337
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues i'm going to talk about</font>

338
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,100
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other ones we basically download</font>

339
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:22,888
the top 50 popular packages in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top</font>

340
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,600
50 dependent upon packages so something

341
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,070
that people are downloading a lot and

342
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,800
then dependencies that are buying being

343
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:31,019
consumed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dependent by the popular</font>

344
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,510
packages and some other packages that

345
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we thought were pretty cool we</font>

346
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyzed the results we performed</font>

347
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,750
responsible disclosure to the developer

348
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">because all that's information is there</font>

349
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,040
pull them what vulnerabilities we're

350
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,560
happening waited for a patch and then

351
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:51,329
publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data this is where the</font>

352
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:54,899
interesting part happened so here's an

353
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:56,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of what we did one of the things</font>

354
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,019
that's interesting though if you see

355
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,990
here here's some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packages we scan</font>

356
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,970
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we scan them the loc is the lines</font>

357
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,610
of code some of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small we</font>

358
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,800
cut we contact the the owner of the code

359
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,180
it's a you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple line we saw it</font>

360
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,229
lodash look like couple lines of code

361
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,810
you could fix something in there really

362
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly some of these are large look at</font>

363
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,069
lodash it's a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and twenty eight</font>

364
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:18,569
thousand lines of code so to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

365
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,970
vulnerability in that code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

366
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,740
take some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time even if you communicate</font>

367
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,300
the right information it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a</font>

368
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,339
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that vulnerability to be</font>

369
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,670
fixed it and for the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

370
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:32,250
published and everyone to be happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

371
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,170
consider the complexity in the size the

372
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,839
raw size of these applications can

373
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:41,969
sometimes delay the process for an

374
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:46,949
accurate remediation so again here's the

375
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:50,069
code snippet we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with our</font>

376
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:55,979
platform identify of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> denial of service</font>

377
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:58,349
attack based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that null byte it was</font>

378
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,690
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> package that we downloaded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> node</font>

379
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:05,370
ecstatic it has a very very large<font color="#CCCCCC"> twelve</font>

thousand downloads in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> latin this is</font>

381
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,658
not yesterday this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when i create the</font>

382
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,429

385
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,720
seventy eight thousand downloads in the

386
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:23,420
math last month 369 other packages are

387
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,640
dependent on this in this head the same

388
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,040
vulnerability you can see very similar

389
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,150
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other vulnerability we have found</font>

390
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we tried to prove it we sent a</font>

391
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:42,870
load check marks calm with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the null and</font>

392
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,180
we reported<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the developer said I</font>

393
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think it's a bug not a bug not</font>

394
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,580
worried about it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bug he said</font>

395
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:55,350
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's really an issue nope don't</font>

396
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:58,409
bother<font color="#E5E5E5"> me okay with a 22 k b payload</font>

397
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:01,919
weight on one second lag 35 kb payload a

398
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:05,400
three-second lag and<font color="#CCCCCC"> an 86 k</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> palin kb</font>

399
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,500
payload the server crashed this is where

400
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,150
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets interesting so we go back go</font>

401
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:18,990
back a couple slides there was 369 other

402
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:20,970
packages dependent on this 369 so well

403
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:27,720
we showed him the results of the the

404
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:29,190
payload he said oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then this was</font>

405
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:35,850
just basically for an old browser anyway

406
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:37,680
and just commented it out these are the

407
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,659
things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be concerned about so</font>

408
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,360
the vulnerable code wasn't even real

409
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,710
code I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was yeah we usually put</font>

410
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,060
that in there for an old browser nobody

411
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,970
uses anymore so we'll just comment it

412
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:53,730
out uploaded it and then the payload it

413
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually fixed it we also found this</font>

414
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,390
one's not publish it so I can't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

415
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,399
who it is but we also found a command

416
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,080
injection<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the variable input was</font>

417
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,030
used as an argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an OS command</font>

418
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,399
the flaw exists because the original

419
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">author used it possible solution just</font>

420
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,770
delete<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file it's still in there he</font>

421
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,240
hasn't fixed it but his fix was ah

422
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,920
that's somebody that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here anymore</font>

423
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,670
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really know what it does just</font>

424
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,900
delete it you should be good these are

425
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,570
the things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

426
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,070
carelessness code that's just kicking

427
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,450
around especially with the complexity of

428
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,460

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,950
because the dependencies have

yes it is a concern it does save time
