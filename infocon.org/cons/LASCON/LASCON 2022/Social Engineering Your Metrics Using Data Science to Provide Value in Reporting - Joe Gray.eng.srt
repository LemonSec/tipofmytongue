welcome to social engineering your

7
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,520
metrics uh this is using data science to

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,559
provide value and Reporting if you're

9
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,239
here looking for a data science talk

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,319
where we're going to be talking about

11
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,420
all these fancy neural networks long

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,640
short-term memory models and all of that

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,780
fun stuff

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,180
you might be disappointed

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,939
they're all going to be mentioned but

16
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,700
that's not going to be the main focus

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,040
honestly this was probably if we want to

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,439
talk mathematically a stats 101 level

19
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,400
course

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,580
but it's something that's important it's

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,380
a conversation that needs to be had can

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,560
everyone in the back hear me okay cool

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,960
uh I like to pace so having a microphone

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,000
a handheld one's a little tricky at

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,759
times so anyway

26
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,200
um about me

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,600
I'm the founder instructor and content

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,420
developer at the Ascension uh by day uh

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,860
I do threat hunting and intelligence at

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,200
mercari uh I served in the Navy on

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,720
submarines I've written for Forbes and

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,840
other Publications such as the fine at t

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,420
Security Alien Vault blog not that

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,520
Kate's back there and there might be a

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,200
check in the mail

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
um or any of that I do a lot of

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,219
competition as well in both ocean and

38
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,920
social engineering I'm the 2017 derbycon

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,020
scctf winner I've been on the winning

40
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,580
team for the past three years at the

41
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,099
desk Defcon uh ocean search party

42
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,720
powered by Trace Labs the missing person

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,180
CTF

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,319
despite not speaking French at the time

45
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,000
I was the runner-up in a french-speaking

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,120
sec TF uh the phrase parlez-vous worked

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,099
really well

48
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,599
um I think I also became a tap dancing

49
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,360
professional that day as well

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,819
um coming up with excuses as to why a

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,319
non-french speaker is calling French

52
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,819
people

53
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,140
it worked

54
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,180
uh I also wrote practical social

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,819
engineering here's a copy

56
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,620
um there's two copies that will be part

57
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,060
of the giveaway if you want to order it

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,920
go for it those are both redirect

59
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,440
domains hence the HTTP one takes you to

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,420
Amazon the other to no starch but

61
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,360
either or don't feel obligated I'm not

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,459
here to pitch the book I'm actually here

63
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,680
to try to educate people and change

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,760
things

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,980
standard disclaimer thoughts and

66
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,379
opinions are mine not my employers past

67
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,239
present or future some of the past ones

68
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,819
might want to think it's theirs but no

69
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,560
anyway

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,599
so here's the objectives for today we're

71
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,180
going to talk about General metrics then

72
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,500
we'll talk about social engineering

73
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,720
specific metrics

74
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,239
and then the problem with metrics

75
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,300
from there I'm going to introduce you

76
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,640
some new metrics maybe not necessarily

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,580
entirely new but under

78
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,980
terms you may not be intimately familiar

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,980
with that may be more relatable than the

80
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,019
ones you may be aware of we'll talk

81
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,879
about some analysis models and then the

82
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,860
potential for future integration

83
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,260
so when we think about current infosec

84
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,518
metrics what comes to mind

85
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,299
yes what else

86
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,620
patches yes what else

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,239
mttr yeah

88
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,480
uh incidents yes all of those things are

89
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,400
there right we also have password

90
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,400
metrics right so this is the number of

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
passwords within a breach

92
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
okay cool

93
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,220
here's what I like to know about those

94
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,320
anytime I get my hands on breach data I

95
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,260
want to know the length and complexity

96
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,639
and periodicity or frequency rather of a

97
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,440
specific passwords occurrence

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
just because it's on John or rocky.txt

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,120
cool but I want to know what the the

100
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,740
average length is I want to know about

101
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,440
reuse because that's that's where

102
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,699
adversaries are really going to catch

103
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,040
you with your pants down right

104
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,320
they don't care that it's a 12 character

105
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,919
password but if it's you know spring

106
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,840
2022 exclamation point spring 2022

107
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,180
I mean is that really hard to guess

108
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,340
uh just a few days ago on LinkedIn

109
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,259
someone had posted a screenshot they

110
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,580
were building a lab environment they

111
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,560
were using pro wrestlers names for the

112
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,300
active directory accounts and someone's

113
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,340
like you totally left off Hulk Hogan I

114
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,080
was like if you create a Hulk Hogan

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,460
account that password had better be

116
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,250
brother brother

117
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,300
[Laughter]

118
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,340
ironically my cousin's in Orlando at a

119
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,780
Hulk Hogan autograph signing right now

120
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,759
uh I tried to get him to take An

121
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,259
ancestry DNA test with him but he

122
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,820
wouldn't do it

123
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,380
just to prove that everybody's not his

124
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,660
brother but umptious

125
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,400
um but we also have breach metrics right

126
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,500
so with that that's going to be things

127
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,479
like dwell time and how bad they were

128
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,400
pwned and the financial loss and all of

129
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,340
that stuff it's important I mean yeah

130
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,220
but it's not

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,820
always important response metrics now

132
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,380
we're talking about things that somewhat

133
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,580
matter

134
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,259
dwell time

135
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,340
that makes some really good vendor

136
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,800
Publications

137
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,720
it's it's real it's something we should

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,900
be concerned with but

139
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,960
if if they're able to get in and stay in

140
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,120
undetected that long the dwell time is a

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,380
moot point

142
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,720
it's like you need to you need to go

143
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,780
back a bit and then of course there's

144
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,880
return on investment right so when we

145
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,680
talk about passwords again we've got

146
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,120
length complexity age

147
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,280
breaches the number of assets password

148
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,600
reuse

149
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,240
the number of breaches that occur

150
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,620
and then the ratio of users in breaches

151
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,500
well these breaches uh collectively uh

152
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,080
affected on average 143 000 users per

153
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,280
organization

154
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,380
okay

155
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,300
how does that help me improve my

156
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,960
security program

157
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,520
my organization does not have 143 000

158
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,500
people in it so

159
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,120
that

160
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,979
that is a perfect example of the flow

161
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,919
chart between data

162
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,460
information and intelligence right

163
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,180
and an example of intelligence is

164
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,759
at this current moment at 3 13 PM in

165
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,800
Austin Texas

166
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,840
it is

167
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,380
um 79 degrees outside

168
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,460
that's

169
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,380
that's intelligence because that tells

170
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,280
us that we probably don't want to be

171
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,240
wearing a sweater outside right uh it is

172
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,380
sunny outside as well so if you have

173
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,580
sunglasses you may want to wear them

174
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,919
especially if you have sensitive eyes

175
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,199
another data point would be right well

176
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,020
data would be the current temperature in

177
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,180
Seattle Washington is I don't know

178
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,220
presumably I'll say 58 that's probably a

179
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,599
safe guess

180
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,340
that's data

181
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,199
is it undisputable

182
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,080
yes well that one is disputed but if I

183
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,139
actually knew the number off the offhand

184
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,000
it is factual

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,539
it is true but it is irrelevant

186
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,599
it does nothing for us right here

187
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,880
in the world of working from home it is

188
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,319
not a reason to put a shirt on to get on

189
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,560
Zoom

190
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,960
response metrics mean time to respond

191
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,300
that's a good one right how long does it

192
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,460
take us to respond I really like this

193
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,720
metric but I'm actually going to give

194
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,520
you a different terminology for that

195
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,900
that's probably going to be a little bit

196
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,319
easier for delay person the less

197
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,039
technical uh team members and management

198
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,060
to consume because at the end of the day

199
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,979
we have to be able to speak nerd we have

200
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,240
to be able to build a rapport with each

201
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,180
other but the higher you ascend in

202
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,620
management the more you need to be able

203
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,199
to translate nerd to business

204
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,520
they don't care about a cross-site

205
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,020
request forgery

206
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,159
they care about how much they're gonna

207
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,599
have to pay on a bug Bounty or how much

208
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,620
it's going to cost when they get caught

209
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,479
with their pants down

210
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,760
the return on investment and the

211
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,640
realized risk right keep that in mind

212
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,099
the number of incidents that's a that's

213
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,560
uh that's questionable as well depending

214
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
on your threat model

215
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,120
dwell time yeah we know it's how long an

216
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
adversary remains hidden and dormant

217
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,180
before being detected whether

218
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,899
voluntarily or involuntarily

219
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,580
Roi

220
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,380
ratio of expenditures versus the

221
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,700
forecasted

222
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,160
uh or perceived losses so let's talk

223
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,620
about true social engineering metrics

224
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,360
Chris what do you think of when you

225
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,600
think social engineering metrics

226
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
yep

227
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,839
especially using some of John strand's

228
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,640
terminology especially if you're dealing

229
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,760
with like a pen test puppy mill right

230
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,940
what do they care about clicks and opens

231
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,339
we're we're super Elite we sent this out

232
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,640
and 98 of the organization opened it and

233
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,620
60 clicked on it

234
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,180
what's rule number one of Improv

235
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,040
no matter the question the answer is

236
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,600
always yes and

237
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,220
yes and they clicked on it but what

238
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,300
happened

239
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,459
I don't know

240
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,220
okay I click on malicious crap all the

241
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,000
time

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,220
not even when I'm analyzing it how are

243
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,860
you supposed to know something is

244
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,160
malicious if you don't investigate it

245
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,120
granted some of the people clicking on

246
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,980
it are barely qualified to show up to

247
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,660
work on time and do their job adequately

248
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,839
much less investigate something but

249
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,260
that's not that's not a them problem

250
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,180
that's an us problem

251
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,700
so when we talk about these metrics

252
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,880
opens clicks credentials stolen that's

253
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,500
one that I actually like because it's

254
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,180
actually indicative of something that

255
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,459
can cause some serious havoc in your

256
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,700
organization I mean

257
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,740
wasn't there a breach or something

258
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,060
that's been making the news lately that

259
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,920
had something to do with snagging

260
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,000
credentials from somewhere

261
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,580
hmm sounds like somebody's trying to get

262
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,720
a ride back there

263
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,160
yeah

264
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,779
but anyway

265
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,399
if you want to go a little step further

266
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,220
you can go with averages or ratios

267
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,920
ratios are really good uh opens clicks

268
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,980
and stolen credentials right so

269
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,220
what's the problem with all of these

270
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,820
any ideas

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,240
They Don't Really measure a whole lot

272
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,060
if anything they measure

273
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,940
a consultant's ability to monetize the

274
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,240
minimal effort for the maximum paycheck

275
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,079
I mean I say that it really sounds mean

276
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,519
I'm sorry

277
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,600
but it's a bitter I mean it's

278
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,279
you ought to know it's a Jagged Little

279
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
Pill

280
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,000
I mean

281
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,839
sorry so the reason I say that emails

282
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,000
are meant to be opened

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,560
even if someone doesn't directly open

284
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,399
them

285
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,399
in some cases some male providers and

286
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,899
browsers

287
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,720
also have a preview pane

288
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,240
sometimes preview pain

289
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,579
the preview paint itself will indicate

290
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,440
to someone who's measuring opens that

291
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
it's been opened when it hasn't

292
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
right

293
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,540
honestly a lot of the training platforms

294
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,480
they fall short on detonating links

295
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,300
because they're like oh just report this

296
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,060
okay it gets reported what happens

297
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,160
it sits there whoever it is that's

298
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,540
running the training platform gets to

299
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,279
benefit from it whether they do

300
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,920
something with it or not but you the

301
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,480
customer that's paying for the platform

302
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,339
do you ever see feedback based on that

303
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,440
do you ever see changes

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
right

305
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,260
I'm not going to speak for every

306
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,839
platform out there but I'm going to say

307
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,060
confidently that greater than 50 percent

308
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,820
of this audience would agree that the

309
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,800
client never sees anything discernible

310
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,899
come from that

311
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,519
so you know and honestly most tech folks

312
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,800
people like my mom

313
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,839
they use the same password or some

314
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,880
variant thereof everywhere

315
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,260
we've not gotten to the point of

316
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,899
getting things like password managers in

317
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,300
the mainstream granted things like I

318
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,620
don't know if Android's doing it but I

319
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,240
know iPhone's offering something kind of

320
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,800
similar they're offering email

321
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,079
obfuscation Services now

322
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,360
they're trying to take steps and they

323
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,820
are they are working to get things

324
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,160
more normalized

325
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,079
I'm not a fan of DuckDuckGo I'm not

326
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,480
going to get into a into why in here but

327
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,740
if you want to have that conversation we

328
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,940
can have it in the lobby afterwards

329
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,740
they're doing good things for security

330
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,540
though

331
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,920
I don't agree with the fact that they've

332
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,540
got a billboard like every city and

333
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,360
honestly I think that their commercial

334
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,620
uh with

335
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,380
um the music of who is it sting uh

336
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,339
that's making fun of all the other

337
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,320
search engines

338
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,880
um I think it's stupid but it's doing a

339
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,139
lot of good things for security because

340
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,760
in the airport yesterday I heard a

341
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,040
couple of old ladies talking about it

342
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,019
and then I got to pontificate why I

343
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,160
think doctor goes trash

344
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,579
but as a byproduct we as Security

345
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,320
Professionals have not found a way to

346
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,180
integrate security and the concepts that

347
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,000
we need in the workplace into someone's

348
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,160
personal life you teach someone how to

349
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,660
secure their kids account how to secure

350
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,279
their home network they're going to go

351
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,180
home they're going to do it they're

352
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,500
going to take it hard and it's going to

353
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,220
become part of their lifestyle right it

354
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,500
goes back to diet versus lifestyle you

355
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,820
do a diet you're going to fall off of it

356
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,320
you make a lifestyle change you'll be

357
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,660
fine right same thing

358
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,480
so keep that in mind right if you need

359
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,399
proof that people use the same password

360
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,019
all over the place

361
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,240
go take a look at dehashed

362
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,040
connect to the have I been poned API

363
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,600
it'll tell you all you need to know and

364
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,920
then some

365
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,839
so what am I getting at

366
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,820
if we care about opens

367
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,740
it is encouraging

368
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,639
punishing people for opening emails

369
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,019
granted you're going to have most people

370
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,579
acting in good faith but you're going to

371
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:39,899
have those troubled employees that

372
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,120
purposely blow off emails that are

373
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,740
important for things they don't want to

374
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,480
do saying Oh I thought that was a fish

375
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,540
I mean I've seen it happen

376
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,100
right

377
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,139
it already

378
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,480
that is a slippery slope and you're

379
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,980
going to have some naive employees that

380
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,480
are going to think everything's a fish

381
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,699
and they're just gonna start consuming

382
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,980
so much of Securities resources to try

383
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,839
to validate things

384
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,880
but yeah

385
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
they're meant to be opened it doesn't

386
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,040
accurately address risk because let's

387
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,260
face it if your architecture is so

388
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,180
fragile that someone opening a phishing

389
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,880
email collapses your architecture

390
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,680
might I recommend going and getting a

391
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,339
cissp

392
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,839
system hardening might not be in your in

393
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,440
in the best uh pursuit of your um Career

394
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,000
Success at this time

395
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,980
you might want to go and look otherwise

396
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,139
because that completely negates the

397
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,600
concept of Defense in depth right if a

398
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,899
system is that fragile then

399
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,240
why why are you even at a maturity level

400
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,560
why when you should be phishing

401
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,300
employees

402
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,699
getting into clicks I will admit clicks

403
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,100
are more relevant than opens

404
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,260
it tests the human

405
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,300
but honestly if you have proper defense

406
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,339
in depth that should be minor because at

407
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,380
the end of the day

408
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,139
social engineering is human intelligence

409
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,120
it is human

410
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,100
it is

411
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,720
the human element

412
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,139
it is attacking things that people may

413
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,959
call the lizard brain right

414
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,699
you're dealing with underlying

415
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,560
psychological Concepts that are in many

416
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,120
cases subconscious to a lot of people

417
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,040
but at the end of the day these tests

418
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,500
should not be to test the people the

419
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,839
tests should be to test your processes

420
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,420
most importantly secondarily your

421
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,459
architecture and then finally as a

422
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,680
tertiary thing it should be there to

423
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,000
condition

424
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,360
the humans to make the decisions you

425
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,199
want

426
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,180
but they should only be confronted with

427
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,880
making those decisions only after your

428
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,959
procedural and your technical

429
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
implementations have either lapsed

430
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,579
failed or in many cases just

431
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,019
non-existent

432
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,060
that's the problem too many times you

433
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,740
deal with managers it's like I I want

434
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,300
you to come in I want you to bulldoze

435
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,680
everybody I want you to fish them all I

436
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,300
want you to prove just how stupid they

437
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,419
are

438
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,859
yourself

439
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,980
um

440
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,199
okay maybe

441
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,419
can I prove how stupid you are

442
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,620
that sounds like a more fun game

443
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,500
but honestly it should be more of a test

444
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,819
of your technical solution than the

445
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,839
people but you know as the slide says

446
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,080
managers often miss that point

447
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,120
stolen creds

448
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,740
it's predicated on failing to have a

449
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,140
password policy it's predicated on not

450
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,679
having multi-factor Authentication

451
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,880
it does hold weight because of password

452
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,559
reuse

453
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,020
but you know if

454
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,000
somebody wants my Facebook password just

455
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
hold a gun to my head I'll open one

456
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,419
password and show you and then I'll go

457
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,400
change it it's all good

458
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,080
I mean do you want me to try to read out

459
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,780
all 64 to 100 characters of it

460
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,000
I ain't got time for that

461
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,460
I've got more smoking and joking to

462
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,559
doing the speakers room later today I

463
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,559
think I don't know but anyway it can

464
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,080
also lead to scope creep and it does

465
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,360
lead to illegal activity like when I do

466
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,980
an ocent report or a social engineering

467
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,120
report

468
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
if one person hires me to do an

469
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,620
engagement against just them I will give

470
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,039
them usernames and passwords no problem

471
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,919
if a company hires me here's your choice

472
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,539
do you want the users that need to reset

473
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,620
their passwords or do you want the

474
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,880
passwords that you need to put on the

475
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,880
block list you're not getting both

476
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,220
and here's why I have no Assurance after

477
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,620
transmission of that report that they

478
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,200
that everyone in that company I have no

479
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,520
assurance that the company is going to

480
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,980
secure the report correctly

481
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,960
assuming they do I have no assurance

482
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,760
that people with access to said report

483
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,860
are going to act legally and ethically

484
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,020
and not use it to abuse people

485
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,240
and quite honestly

486
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
they don't need both so you have that so

487
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,700
here's the tldr on that

488
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,440
organizations often and I'm not saying

489
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,940
this is not a blanket statement that all

490
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,100
organizations but many put the burden

491
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,500
solely on non-technical employees

492
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,320
let's be honest Finance and Accounting

493
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
I care that they know the bare minimum

494
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
about security

495
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,760
I don't care if they know what

496
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,200
cross-site scripting is I don't care if

497
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,720
they even know what SQL is

498
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
honestly it's probably better that they

499
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,179
don't

500
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,260
what I care about is that they are

501
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,780
rightly suspicious about things and that

502
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,160
my paychecks come into the correct

503
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,200
account on time that's what I care about

504
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,240
should they know what a password manager

505
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,460
is depends on your company

506
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,919
should they know what what the

507
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,020
difference between Shaw 256 and 512 is

508
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,460
no

509
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,340
they could probably say oh well

510
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,720
one's bigger than the other

511
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,200
okay what Shaw doesn't matter

512
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,440
right and organizations also fail to see

513
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,260
that technology is never going to

514
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,020
completely solve the problem to kind of

515
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,539
get into a different cultural reference

516
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:04,980
I've hit you with some Alanis Morissette

517
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,720
let's let's go to some like New York

518
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,179
hip-hop here you know

519
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,860
what do you have to have to buy

520
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,260
Technical Solutions

521
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,400
money

522
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,740
Mo Money Mo what

523
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,320
problems right so more Technical

524
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,720
Solutions they may potentially they

525
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,520
won't fully solve a problem

526
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,919
but they can potentially mitigate it but

527
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,160
the thing is oftentimes and this is a

528
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,820
problem in various Arenas it's in Vendor

529
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,660
marketing materials it's in Vendor

530
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,340
analysts like

531
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,380
I don't know what's what's that magic

532
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,980
magic quadrant thing

533
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,120
foreign

534
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
it's in that and it's also in the

535
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,559
mindset of management of I don't want to

536
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,360
fully confront this problem and take the

537
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,100
time to work through the steps to solve

538
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,480
the problem I just want to throw money

539
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,460
at it and be done with it

540
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,620
that is the problem

541
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,740
and then at the end I mean

542
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,740
it is a bitter pill to swallow

543
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,000
but

544
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,980
a lot of people have too much ego and

545
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,380
pride to admit their own shortcomings

546
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,660
and having worked in Consulting

547
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,840
one of the things I mean I was paid to

548
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,280
go in and tell organizations that their

549
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,080
babies were ugly

550
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,820
organizations have a hard time hearing

551
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,380
that

552
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,000
because you've got people who have

553
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,340
intimately worked on constructing

554
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,380
something and putting it together and

555
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,480
for you to say it is flawed and here is

556
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,760
why they take it as a personal attack

557
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,100
and that's the problem

558
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,840
so

559
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,760
thanks for talking about the crash

560
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,000
course in current metrics you all ready

561
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,260
to hear about some that actually matter

562
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,460
at least in my opinion

563
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,600
open to click ratio

564
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,280
so

565
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,039
in comparison a hundred people opened

566
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,980
the email but only 33 click it

567
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,960
that is something that is manageable

568
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,240
that is something that if we're talking

569
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,280
statistically

570
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,460
qualitative versus quantitative that is

571
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,620
quantitative in nature because you can

572
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,380
repeat that type of Engagement and

573
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,440
measure the progressive improvements

574
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
you can measure differences between

575
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,400
those engagements to determine potential

576
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,440
triggers where you can invest time and

577
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,360
effort or potentially Technical

578
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,120
Solutions if need be to solve that

579
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,500
problem

580
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,020
open to action what's an example of

581
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,340
action

582
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,039
clicking inputting data

583
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,799
forwarding I mean that's one of my

584
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,740
favorites like with a fish

585
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,620
clicking is so uh so last year right

586
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,440
actually it's like so five years ago

587
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
macros I don't know let's not even talk

588
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,940
about macros but if you can get people

589
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,380
to forward it

590
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,539
and then you get people replying all to

591
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,559
say stop replying all

592
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,600
if you embed a link somewhere in there

593
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,220
I'll tell you my personal favorite place

594
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,900
is

595
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,520
doesn't matter what the link says I just

596
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,860
need the word unsubscribe

597
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,140
put it at the bottom you've got your

598
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,580
denial of service going on because

599
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,260
everybody's replying all to say stop

600
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,059
replying all meanwhile someone's going

601
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,500
to be smart and click unsubscribe

602
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,539
the most successful fish I did it was

603
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,059
absolute junk

604
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,340
not a single Link in it

605
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,620
13 days in a row

606
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,919
on the 14th day I am sorry

607
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,860
it has been uh it has been brought to my

608
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,380
attention that this email campaign is

609
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,299
not in compliance with the USA can spam

610
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,520
Act I did not have an unsubscribe Link

611
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
in it if you wish to be unsubscribed

612
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,700
from this list please click here

613
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,120
's your next musical reference

614
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,158
what can I say except you're welcome

615
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,400
but the the important metric here open

616
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,880
to reporting how long from the time

617
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,100
an email is opened until it is reported

618
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,980
whether that be through a report fish

619
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,940
button

620
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,340
forwarding the email to security calling

621
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,679
security walking to security or I mean

622
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,120
quite frankly if you're into smoke

623
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,679
signals Morse code or carrier pigeons

624
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,419
that works too

625
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,059
I mean there's that and then the same

626
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,580
thing for clicks right you can do the

627
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,380
same thing for opens and clicks and

628
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,240
they're both meaningful sets of metrics

629
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,980
because you can work on how do we get

630
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,900
fewer people to open these emails how do

631
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,039
we get fewer people to click these

632
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,539
emails how do we get more people to

633
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,880
report this that tells you where you

634
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,799
need to invest your time and effort and

635
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,960
then of course whatever action they do

636
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,480
whether it be click open enter whatever

637
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,400
to reporting

638
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,919
when I oversaw Security in a previous

639
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,039
role I had someone that clicked a link

640
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,240
and they came and they were like I am so

641
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,679
stupid I clicked this link what do you

642
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:53,700
want me to do

643
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,440
I was like

644
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,179
I'm coming to your office it's all good

645
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,740
so I just unplugged it from the network

646
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,159
did what I had to do it was all good

647
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,620
after that uh anyone in here ever been

648
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,679
in the military or worked uh in a on a

649
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,020
government site

650
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,940
so do you all remember those pesky

651
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,620
laminated bomb threat worksheets that

652
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,480
was next to every single phone with the

653
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,100
grease pencil that was like here are the

654
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,059
questions you need to ask

655
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,539
I call those the oh worksheets

656
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:26,220
I created my own version of them

657
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,779
laminated them and put them on

658
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,380
everyone's desk

659
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,880
I clicked something here's the website I

660
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,440
was on this is the email this is

661
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,760
everything

662
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,520
they fill that out they leave it there

663
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,320
I changed all the network cables to

664
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,640
Yellow if you've ever worked in

665
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,720
classified environments you can

666
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,039
understand why the Department of Defense

667
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,279
absolutely lost their mind on me

668
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,799
this was on an unclassified Network

669
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,620
and then I went and I bought zip ties

670
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,120
and scissors

671
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,980
and I zip tied a pair of scissors to

672
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,320
every single network cable and I said if

673
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,700
you're not comfortable unplugging a

674
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,000
yellow cable cut it

675
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,159
that way all evidence is preserved it's

676
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,539
off the network we're good

677
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,539
that way the next time someone clicked

678
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,679
on something they could fill out their

679
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,659
oh worksheet but at the same time

680
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,159
they could immediately report it to me

681
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,200
that's driving that action to reporting

682
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
time drastically down that's taking it

683
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,700
from 10 minutes we'll say 10 to 15

684
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,380
minutes because when this user

685
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,580
specifically did this I was outside

686
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,620
smoking I smoked at the time

687
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,220
to a minute and a half

688
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,480
so

689
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,880
containment

690
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,799
so with this you know we talked about

691
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,419
open to click

692
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,960
yes

693
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,479
thank you

694
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,039
none

695
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,720
I I know of one but that's only because

696
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,279
I adopted it but I'm pretty sure since I

697
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,299
left they've rolled it back

698
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:01,679
yeah

699
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,080
I mean I've been pontificating it from

700
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,900
the the the speaker Pulpit for some time

701
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,240
but I I've never had any feedback of

702
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,520
anyone that's actually implemented it

703
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,100
but I mean you can't get shocked from

704
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,260
cutting a networking cable

705
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,860
I mean

706
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,419
yeah

707
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,460
what what website were you on what

708
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,380
application were you using what time of

709
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,299
day was it what was the subject line of

710
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,620
the email there's so many different ways

711
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,000
you could go about it and it would work

712
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,279
fine because that's giving you context

713
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,480
that we're going to get into a little

714
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,460
bit later that's going to give you some

715
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,980
hunt context and some IR context you can

716
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,480
go hop into your mail server oh well

717
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,679
here's the subject line let's see who

718
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,179
else got it let's let's pull it all back

719
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,279
yank it from the inboxes cool had this

720
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,600
domain all right we're going to sinkhole

721
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,760
this we're going to do that boom

722
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,559
oh it's because of this application oh

723
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,120
this application's not on the allow list

724
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,059
cool let's go into our MDR or EDR and

725
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:57,600
take that out too done what other events

726
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,100
exist with this oh well seven other

727
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,419
users did this okay cool let's

728
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,179
quarantine them as well

729
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,559
there you have it

730
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,539
right that's why

731
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,480
it's a big deal so with opens we have

732
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,059
clicks as well so

733
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,520
you know inevitably you want the click

734
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,820
to action ratio to be like honestly zero

735
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,860
to zero you want the ratio to be one

736
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,980
right that's what you really want

737
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,900
that's utopian

738
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,640
if we lived in a utopian world we would

739
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,400
not be having these conferences

740
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,779
really we would have nothing to talk

741
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,700
about

742
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,140
Chris would not have a reason to drink

743
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,279
whiskey

744
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,659
he would have he'd have to find one

745
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,059
where there's a will there's a way

746
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,140
so

747
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,020
that's the action ratios

748
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,720
here are some distance ones

749
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,779
open to action click to action open to

750
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,520
report click to report Action to report

751
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,080
so

752
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,240
what is a distance measurement

753
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,620
everything we were talking about before

754
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,179
were ratios

755
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,520
this is distance

756
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,279
this is hinged Upon Time

757
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,539
mean time to respond mean time to detect

758
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,919
honestly when you're talking about like

759
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,480
statistic things like the mean time to

760
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,539
do whatever like the meantime to see

761
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,340
Chris drink whiskey

762
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,620
that really just sounds kind of

763
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,179
intimidating

764
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,299
I know what I know what mean means I

765
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,460
know that the mean is an average

766
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,559
but sometimes people don't understand

767
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,899
that you're speaking statistically and

768
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,340
sometimes when you're using terminology

769
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,520
like the mean time to do something

770
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,700
it sounds like big words and some people

771
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,799
they have fragile egos they don't like

772
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,299
hearing big words

773
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,059
so use distance

774
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,520
this is the distance between this the

775
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,799
distance is 39 minutes

776
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,779
okay your next engagement it's 36

777
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:52,980
minutes okay there's a three minute

778
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,340
Improvement that is quantifiable

779
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,779
that is something you can measure and

780
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,159
improve upon

781
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,120
so that's why it's a big deal the the

782
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
relevance is honestly yes do we want our

783
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,559
incident response team to be busy all

784
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,360
the time no

785
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,059
if anything we want them to be threat

786
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,980
hunting going to training going to

787
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,380
conferences writing blogs updating

788
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,440
githubs doing nothing

789
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,860
again that's utopian

790
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,480
but

791
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,539
at the same time we want to be notified

792
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:28,799
sooner rather than later if someone

793
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,140
clicks on something I want them to tell

794
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,980
me

795
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,260
not some other user that just had

796
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,340
something pop up on their screen

797
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,020
demanding Bitcoin

798
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,659
or I mean that's like so five years ago

799
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,340
Monero

800
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,960
right

801
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,240
if it's demanding cryptocurrency or

802
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,980
something like that I would rather find

803
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,480
out okay well someone clicked something

804
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,100
and it just happens to be an exploit kit

805
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,080
for this type of ransomware or this type

806
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,320
of other malware

807
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,120
disconnect it from the network stop the

808
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,419
spread minimize the spread so that I'm

809
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:01,919
finding out from you the incident

810
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,320
response team has work to do but less

811
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,059
work to do than if it's the entire

812
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,799
organization and then that way you don't

813
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,419
have to worry about getting emails and

814
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,799
phone calls from Brian Krebs

815
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,880
just saying

816
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,500
also

817
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,260
he's not here today but uh with a hat

818
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,500
tip to good old winch worto

819
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,000
a seminal book in this industry I think

820
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,500
everyone should read as time-based

821
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,940
security

822
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,399
the tldr of the book is this you

823
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,779
shouldn't be investing all of your

824
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:37,740
effort into trying to stop everything

825
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,740
you should invest to such a level to

826
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,919
where you have enough defenses to

827
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,740
protect and

828
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,260
defend until you can detect and act upon

829
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,279
it

830
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,140
so you're not looking for the perfect

831
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,260
solution you're looking for the most

832
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,419
suitable solution

833
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,419
so focus on building your defenses in

834
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,659
such a way that provide an a suitable

835
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,220
amount of protection

836
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,320
while also building up your detections

837
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,600
to where I'm going to use vendor terms

838
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,100
here so if you're playing a drinking

839
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,080
game Sorry

840
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,419
we want to shift those detections to the

841
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,380
left

842
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,720
to the left to the left

843
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,799
right

844
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,659
I I'm not I'm not going to choreograph a

845
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,159
dance to that I'm not even going to try

846
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,600
to sing it either I'm the person karaoke

847
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,039
bars pay to come in at last call and

848
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,960
make people leave

849
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,220
so

850
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,320
that's the closest to The Beehive you're

851
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,580
going to see me

852
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,279
anyway with that being said that's what

853
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,419
we're trying to do we're trying to

854
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,960
enable detections to move to the left

855
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,840
so basically how much lead time do you

856
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,140
have to enact your incident response

857
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,820
activities

858
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,919
before it becomes an oh holy moment

859
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,200
how long before someone with Chief in

860
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,620
their title comes barking up your tree

861
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,380
or even worse general I'm not talking

862
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,640
about military generals I'm talking like

863
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,279
general counsel

864
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,860
or human resources because usually that

865
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,620
means that uh somebody's about to go

866
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,120
bye-bye

867
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,519
or um you know

868
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,899
goodbye

869
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:18,899
for any of the AOL Generations here

870
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:22,158
what if I'm a consultant

871
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,760
you're in a particular

872
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,200
advantageous position

873
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,000
because you can provide even more value

874
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,340
to your clients within the community and

875
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,860
the community as a whole because you can

876
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,940
do

877
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,679
you can do

878
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,039
per client metrics right

879
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,019
you can anonymize them or heavily redact

880
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:43,919
them

881
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,559
on a per client basis or you can do

882
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,299
sliced

883
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,360
engagement metrics so we ran the same

884
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,500
phishing engagement against seven

885
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,200
organizations this is the outcome and

886
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,220
then you can even compare those

887
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,899
organization one two three four five six

888
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,500
seven right

889
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,460
that's the easy way to do it

890
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,640
you can also go for population metrics

891
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,399
so the samples per client

892
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,960
that would be all of the engagements

893
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,520
with the same client

894
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,839
and then you've got your full population

895
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,119
so this is getting into that stats 101

896
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,679
stuff right so like when you're talking

897
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,359
about your samples n equals 30 for

898
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,159
minimum viable sample size and then

899
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,899
you've got the entire population which

900
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:24,780
blah blah blah blah yeah so that's where

901
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,339
we're going with this so getting into

902
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,379
the basic statistic measurements you've

903
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,659
got the mean let me put that into Sesame

904
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,239
Street terms that's the average

905
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,879
that is the most central tendency of a

906
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,960
data set

907
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,359
you've got the median that is dead

908
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,699
center that's where I graduated in high

909
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,099
school my graduating class had 146 I

910
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,679
graduated 73. my class my senior

911
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,000
prediction was that I was going to be a

912
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,080
meter maid

913
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,460
people took bets on how long it was

914
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,520
going to take me to fail boot camp

915
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,379
I have a 20-year reunion coming up and I

916
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,879
can't wait to drive up in my Jaguar

917
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,820
it'll be very nice

918
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,760
anyway standard deviation that is the

919
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,800
amount of variance between the data

920
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,720
points a high standard deviation means

921
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,660
that it's largely dissimilar

922
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,579
a very small standard deviation means

923
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,720
that it's all grouped kind of close

924
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,400
together like if you're shooting at a

925
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,020
Target you want a very low standard

926
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,359
deviation typically Center Mass

927
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,240
but you know it is what it is I've

928
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,320
talked about quantitative and

929
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,380
qualitative qualitative is like low

930
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,480
medium and high

931
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,339
you understand what it means but you

932
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,020
cannot directly

933
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,300
compare it to something else what I

934
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,119
consider medium you may consider High

935
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,119
right it is what it is

936
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,040
you also have mixed method which is some

937
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,420
combination thereof and that's what

938
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,800
we're seeing with like the vulnerability

939
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,140
scoring stuff right so you've got CVSs

940
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,680
which is largely quantitative numerical

941
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,660
based it's something you can measure and

942
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,339
then a low medium and high but you can

943
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:58,260
also apply mitigating factors to say

944
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,260
this is low medium high so that's

945
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,720
somewhat mixed method so when we talk

946
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,940
about things like data science this is

947
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,560
probably going to be the most data

948
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,240
sciency thing that I say in the whole

949
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,040
presentation

950
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,780
you could do regression analysis

951
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,000
regression is great because it allows

952
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,980
you to compare

953
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,140
data points against all other data

954
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,000
points in a numeric format and find

955
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Trends that's how people find who the

956
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,800
best person to Market to is I took a

957
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,420
graduate level data science class and

958
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,220
they handed me a spreadsheet and said

959
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,900
find the best person to Market to or

960
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,160
better yet find the best woman to Market

961
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,680
to so I had to filter out everything

962
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,859
that was man in the spreadsheet and then

963
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,800
go through and using regression

964
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,760
coincidentally there's only six lines of

965
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,220
code using R but anyway comparing each

966
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,380
data point against each other data point

967
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,420
and it was like women between the ages

968
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,880
of 35 and 40 that are either divorced or

969
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,220
married with two or three children with

970
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,140
an income of this that is how they come

971
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,660
across that it gets normalized it gets

972
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,599
put into one's normalized it's in a

973
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,160
numeric format and then it's compared

974
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,980
that's a huge chunk of data science if

975
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,200
you want to compare known true and known

976
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,420
false then you can do that with two data

977
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,640
sets and it's called cluster analysis

978
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,500
but if you have a data set big enough so

979
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,480
if you're a consultant especially if you

980
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,700
have a data set big enough

981
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,820
you can get some valid use out of it

982
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,400
if you run a program like this for a

983
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,140
significant amount of time you can get

984
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,460
value from it you're not going to be

985
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,099
able to start an engagement tomorrow and

986
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:30,900
then in six months have enough data to

987
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,180
run regression I mean you could do it

988
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,920
the numbers are going to Crunch they're

989
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,359
going to show something there may be

990
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,240
some validity to it but the data set is

991
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,160
going to be so small that it's really

992
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,800
not going to be meaningful for you so

993
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,000
when we talk about the practical

994
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,240
application of this

995
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,300
you need to integrate with your sim or

996
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,220
system logs of some sort

997
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,400
right because in doing so that affords

998
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,260
you the ability to trace all the steps

999
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,660
you know the equivalent and wiresharka

1000
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,060
follow stream right it gives you the

1001
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,520
steps to say well

1002
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,760
emails with this word or with this type

1003
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,420
of subject or I mean if you really want

1004
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,380
to get really nerdy about it this font

1005
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,240
are more apt to be clicked on than

1006
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,099
others

1007
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,079
that is a data point that it would be

1008
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,060
measurable and you can go back with your

1009
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,099
system logs or your sim trace the steps

1010
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,859
going in and say oh yeah this worked

1011
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:31,140
same thing with the ticketing system you

1012
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,420
know I hate tickets I think we all hate

1013
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,940
tickets everybody except for my boss he

1014
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,079
lives and dies by jira

1015
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,240
hey I mean it is what it is

1016
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,839
but basically the big thing with that is

1017
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,859
you've got to have some sort of time

1018
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:53,880
so that's going to rely on probably UTC

1019
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,160
you should probably be using ntp or

1020
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,260
something similar to make sure your time

1021
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,320
is synced so that I mean a few seconds

1022
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,359
is not a big deal in terms of your

1023
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,880
reporting but you need to know precisely

1024
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,220
when the email was sent or when the

1025
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,260
email was opened and when all the

1026
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,079
activities happen so when they report it

1027
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,119
the person taking the report needs to

1028
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,460
say this happened at this time

1029
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,800
all right this hour this minute

1030
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,839
so that that way you can measure your

1031
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,920
distances

1032
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,599
I've pseudocoded the concept but I've

1033
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,220
not finished it so I really honestly

1034
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,440
don't feel comfortable sharing that in

1035
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,000
the integration with data science you

1036
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,440
can do your cluster analysis that's

1037
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,940
going to give you some a b testing of

1038
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,380
sorts that's the easy way to think about

1039
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,480
it does this work or does this work

1040
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,180
which way works better I mean you're not

1041
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,200
going to be able to tell the adversary

1042
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,820
what type of fish you want them to send

1043
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,660
you

1044
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,020
but you can learn which ones your users

1045
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,640
are more apt to fall for and then you

1046
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,320
can further condition them not to fall

1047
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,839
for that type

1048
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,820
you've got recurrental recurrent neural

1049
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,079
networks and long short-term memory

1050
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,400
models that's something you can do

1051
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,540
specifically within like natural

1052
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,520
language processing that's far more

1053
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,740
advanced to look at Beyond this

1054
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,320
um in the I would say in the model of

1055
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,020
crawl walk run that's probably like

1056
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,079
Hussein bolt like

1057
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:10,619
um

1058
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,240
sprinting or like Ultra marathoning so I

1059
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,920
I wouldn't be looking at that quite

1060
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,980
right now so in conclusion you don't

1061
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,119
have a you don't have to have a

1062
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,040
doctorate in data science uh to be able

1063
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,300
to collect analyze and interpret the

1064
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,880
data points right you can look at it you

1065
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,740
can inform your own decisions and you

1066
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,660
can describe that you don't have to have

1067
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,619
a doctor you don't have to have a

1068
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,660
master's even a bachelor's

1069
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,160
you don't have to have any education on

1070
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,200
it I mean you should probably read up on

1071
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,359
it so that you don't come out saying

1072
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,540
something entirely wrong I mean

1073
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,280
keeping with my musical references you

1074
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,119
want to make sure you have the right

1075
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,380
lyrics you don't want to be singing hold

1076
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,560
me close young Tony Danza right it's

1077
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,240
Tiny Dancer

1078
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,920
right you want to make sure like you

1079
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,300
don't have to have that formal education

1080
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,599
but having some level of familiarity and

1081
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,420
exposure and I I don't want to use the

1082
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,460
term education but

1083
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,619
pseudo-educational the topic goes a long

1084
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,839
way I mean I've taken a couple graduate

1085
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,339
level classes at this I'm actually

1086
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,859
considering going and getting another

1087
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:12,839
Masters maybe even a doctorate in it but

1088
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,280
I don't know if I'm ready for that level

1089
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,920
of punishment right now and let's be

1090
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,540
honest there's a lot of snake oil within

1091
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,740
data science

1092
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,800
but it's there especially within sales

1093
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,300
and product teams wow is that much

1094
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,260
different than infosec

1095
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,339
see me in the hallway afterwards and I

1096
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,140
will I will demonstrate my advanced

1097
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,420
persistent Next Generation AI powered

1098
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,140
machine learning enabled zero trust zero

1099
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,819
knowledge pencil eraser

1100
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,320
exactly

1101
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,900
and let's be honest statistics can be

1102
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,359
manipulated for ill gains

1103
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:51,000
right that's just the reality of it so

1104
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,040
understanding something like the

1105
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,900
framework of crisp DM which is talking

1106
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,660
about data modeling and ensuring that

1107
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,339
you're doing ethical data collection and

1108
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,380
ethical

1109
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,140
um analysis is very important so you

1110
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,660
know just keep all of that stuff in mind

1111
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,579
um I've got a coupon code and stuff to

1112
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:09,960
show you but I'm going to open it up for

1113
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,700
questions right now before I share the

1114
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,540
coupon code with you

1115
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,660
any questions concerns

1116
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,520
complaints grievances thoughts opinions

1117
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,599
are otherwise not that I've ever

1118
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,560
rehearsed that phrase

1119
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,720
in terms of reporting to management

1120
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,359
leadership sea level like your engineers

1121
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,160
yeah if you looked at like different

1122
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,980
ways of communicating your results

1123
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,960
it's going to view on that the easiest

1124
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,760
way I would say to report it is you're

1125
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,260
gonna have to socialize the concept to

1126
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,240
management this is what we're doing this

1127
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,280
is the end game show them some metrics

1128
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,040
and some instances where people have

1129
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,020
gotten burned from social engineering

1130
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,359
type attacks and say okay we're going to

1131
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,740
Institute a program this is going to be

1132
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,060
the scope and purpose of the program

1133
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,180
basically a concept of operations

1134
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,560
we're not asking for your permission

1135
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,260
we're just informing you we're going to

1136
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,060
do a baseline test

1137
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,980
here is the formal Baseline test this is

1138
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,020
how it Stacks other companies really

1139
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,160
don't share this data with other

1140
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,359
companies so we don't have anything to

1141
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,040
compare this with so we are going to

1142
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,180
compare with ourselves we're going to be

1143
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,339
doing these engagements at this interval

1144
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:16,380
or this infrequent interval how would

1145
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,300
you like us to report it more often than

1146
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,220
not it could just be a single piece of

1147
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,920
paper last month this month or it could

1148
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,480
be a formal report where they actually

1149
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,099
look at the fish and they look at all

1150
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,020
the technical stuff some are going to

1151
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,640
enjoy that some are going to say give me

1152
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,020
one page

1153
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,900
or hey uh I'm on the elevator to the

1154
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,180
eighth floor you've got until then

1155
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,319
so

1156
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:40,380
it the best way to communicate

1157
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,420
is the one that works

1158
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,099
the same thing with like oh well what's

1159
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,020
the best operating system for oscent the

1160
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,800
one that works for you

1161
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,900
any other questions

1162
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,720
here's my contact information

1163
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,280
um so

1164
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,740
I'll be around uh thanks for coming out

1165
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,440
and uh have fun

1166
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,440
foreign
