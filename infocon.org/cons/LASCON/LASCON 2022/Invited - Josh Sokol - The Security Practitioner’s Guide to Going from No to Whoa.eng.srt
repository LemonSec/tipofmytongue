are you guys having fun at last Cotton

7
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,480
so far

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,940
yeah heck yeah I was talking with uh

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,059
James Wickett in the hallway earlier and

10
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,920
we realized that we've been doing this

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,860
since 2010 and when James and I first

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,979
started this conference we had no clue

13
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,720
what this was going to turn into it was

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,240
just us going like yeah maybe we can put

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,100
something together it might be fun if we

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,020
got like a bunch of our friends in the

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,479
same room and talk security stuff and to

18
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,159
see what all this has turned into is

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,020
pretty incredible it's a pretty amazing

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,220
feeling

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,780
um kudos to Kyle and to Tiana and to all

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,060
of the last con team this event does not

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,700
happen without all their volunteer

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,140
efforts so give them give them a round

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,560
of applause

26
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,020
awesome

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,020
um so I have the the fortune of getting

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,700
to talk to you guys immediately after

29
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,159
lunchtime uh this is the time when the

30
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,740
food coma starts to set in and you know

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,479
we all start to to zone out a little bit

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,759
so I wanted to start us off with some

33
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,640
some jokes jokes well you call a group

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,939
of math and science Geeks at a party

35
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,079
social engineers

36
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,560
oops uh why did the programmer leave the

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
camping trip early

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,099
it's one for my daughters there were too

39
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,840
many bugs

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,599
uh and what are asiso's two biggest

41
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,580
cyber security fears

42
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,260
everyone who works at the company and

43
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,920
everyone who doesn't

44
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,800
get that uh hey I'm Josh uh I used to

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,060
run the security program at National

46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,520
instruments uh I've spent over a decade

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,800
running their security program

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,220
um after that I moved on and now I run

49
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,900
my own business I'm the the founder and

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,360
CEO of a company called semperus a free

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,239
open source GRC uh product

52
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,099
um I was supposed to do this talk with a

53
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,500
buddy named John John is based out of

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,900
Utah uh John uh has been a CSO for a

55
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,060
long long time currently he's the CSO

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,620
over at uh

57
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,440
um Alpine software group ASG and he's

58
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,000
basically like the CSO for a bunch of

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,160
other companies that may or may not have

60
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,319
seasons so his job is even harder than

61
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,040
mine and John unfortunately told me like

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,739
two days ago they can't be here so sorry

63
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,280
John uh but we we all wish you uh the

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,300
best

65
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,239
um if you want the slides I know people

66
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,860
like to look up slides later so I'm

67
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,060
going to make this easy on you I'm going

68
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,920
to put a big long link up there and I'm

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,420
going to put that QR code up there to

70
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,819
make it even easier and because we're

71
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,980
all security people and we don't like QR

72
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,420
codes apparently people were complaining

73
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,099
about the badge and the back how it has

74
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,080
a QR code by the way that's a game it's

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,060
not me trying to to Rickroll you or

76
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,799
something like that

77
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,019
um here's a bitly because bitlys are so

78
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,659
much more secure than QR codes

79
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,580
right yeah

80
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,319
um leave that up for another second

81
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,299
everybody get cool

82
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,480
um yeah so let's uh let's talk about the

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,860
atlas syndrome

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,180
um I talk with customers all the time

85
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,459
about this and as security practitioners

86
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,620
oftentimes we feel like we're Atlas we

87
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,760
have the Way of the World on our

88
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,599
shoulders and everything that we do

89
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,580
every issue that we find every

90
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,260
vulnerability scan that we won't run

91
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,860
every pen test report that we get is

92
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,160
just another weight on our shoulders we

93
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,940
start to to feel the weight of that and

94
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,160
I want you guys to take a moment just to

95
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,740
think about that I think about all the

96
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,960
tools that are in Your Arsenal how many

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,419
are there they're five ten more than

98
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,460
that probably more than that right

99
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,919
you've got your ngav you've got your

100
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,780
firewalls you've got your sim all this

101
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,680
stuff

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
and think about the alerts that are

103
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,280
coming from

104
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,740
don't sorry no heart attacks here today

105
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,940
right

106
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,520
um there's a lot of them and there was a

107
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,120
SC media survey a while back uh 2018 RSA

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
conference and they said that 55 of

109
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,979
Enterprises see more than 10 000 alerts

110
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,000
a day

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,199
whoa uh 27 are seeing more than a

112
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,080
million alerts per day that's a lot can

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
you actually triage all those alerts can

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,280
you do something with those alerts and

115
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,900
even worse

116
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,759
every single one of those alerts is just

117
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,800
another another straw in your back it's

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,500
just more weight on your shoulders uh

119
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,780
there was a demisto state of soar report

120
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,639
and they said security teams were

121
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,479
bombarded with 174 000 alerts a week an

122
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,240
average of just shy of 25 000 a day

123
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,940
so regardless of the source we all know

124
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,680
our security teams are up against a

125
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,940
constant barrage of alerts

126
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,039
now when I was at ni we had over a

127
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,660
hundred thousand vulnerabilities that

128
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,100
were found by our scanner that was

129
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,539
waiting to be triaged and for me I felt

130
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,360
kind of like that guy right the world is

131
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,039
burning around me we've got a lot of

132
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,660
stuff a lot of problems there out there

133
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,060
uh every platform that I learned every

134
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,639
vulnerability that we found I felt like

135
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,639
they were my burden to bear

136
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,500
I'd have panic attacks thinking about

137
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,780
all the what-if scenarios what if a

138
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,160
hacker found that thing that we didn't

139
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,680
fix yesterday what if we have an

140
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,100
internal threat some uh person who finds

141
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,780
that issue on our Network and is able to

142
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,340
compromise that and then the data and

143
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,460
all all these what-if scenarios and if

144
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,600
you're anything like me you probably

145
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,520
have trouble sleeping at night sometimes

146
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,380
thinking about that thing that might be

147
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,139
your final nail in the coffin any of you

148
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,759
guys relate to this am I in the wrong

149
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,000
place okay all right cool we're among

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,300
friends uh so what do we do about

151
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,740
there's a few things we can do about

152
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,199
that the the first is Chicken Little

153
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,639
um Chicken Little is the the security

154
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,620
practitioner that basically runs around

155
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,620
they go the sky is falling right every

156
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,660
new issue the sky is falling there's no

157
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,819
prioritization there's no way to discern

158
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,380
which thing is the most important thing

159
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,000
for us to work on

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,039
and it becomes a constant distraction

161
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,979
from the work which is actually paying

162
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,520
the bills

163
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,360
so what happens next how do we get out

164
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,139
of

165
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,860
this

166
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,479
well management starts telling you no

167
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,060
they start to ignore you uh you get used

168
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,979
to hearing the word no because you're

169
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,199
you're being seen as an inhibitor to the

170
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,280
business

171
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,500
uh John and I were looking at uh Reddit

172
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,340
there's a our CSO on Reddit uh there's

173
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,099
our security on Reddit and I can't tell

174
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,280
you how many times we've seen these uh

175
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,400
security practitioners talking about how

176
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,460
their management doesn't get it right

177
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,919
they talk about how their ciso is a tool

178
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,380
how you know they can't get funding from

179
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,720
the business

180
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,680
you guys relate yes yeah

181
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,539
so I'm gonna give you guys a chance

182
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,780
right red pill blue pill moment here

183
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,099
um

184
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,840
you take the blue pill the story ends

185
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,340
you go back to work continue to feel

186
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,759
like Atlas uh you're gonna bemoan to

187
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,380
your fellow security practitioners about

188
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,880
how you're constantly being told no

189
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,319
right

190
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
or you take the red bill you get to stay

191
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,759
in Wonderland with me and I get to show

192
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,979
you how deep this Rabbit Hole goes

193
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,819
so we're offering the truth nothing more

194
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,520
um so red pill same old way same binary

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
approach same Atlas syndrome or we find

196
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,199
a new way

197
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,080
and this is where my buddy John comes in

198
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,639
and John gets to talk about good

199
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,080
information security and risk management

200
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,479
leadership because well now I guess I'm

201
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,099
the vendor that nobody cares about right

202
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,099
and John's the ciso John John's the the

203
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,500
smart guy in the room it's weird as soon

204
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,059
as you turn to a vendor it's like you're

205
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,700
you're no longer that person

206
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,099
so you know the foundation of this

207
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,180
perspective is that security

208
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,519
leadership's responsibility is to Define

209
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,800
to assess and to contextualize the

210
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,899
reporting we want to make sure that

211
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,060
security practitioners our job is to

212
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,519
assess the risks to find the stuff

213
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,839
that's out there

214
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,839
to convey the risks to make sure that

215
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,240
management that the sea levels that the

216
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,120
board is aware of these risks that exist

217
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,820
but nowhere does it say that our job is

218
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,560
to accept the risk

219
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,899
in fact I would argue that is absolutely

220
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,480
unequivocally not our job as security

221
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,200
practitioners

222
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,140
so Know Your Role right the key here is

223
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,600
that we're not the risk owners

224
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,459
if you guys are assessing the risk if

225
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,260
you're finding these issues how many of

226
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,519
these issues do you guys actually have

227
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,220
the money to fix directly

228
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,959
how many of you guys have the people on

229
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,060
your teens to be able to fix these

230
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,399
issues I'm guessing the answer is like

231
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,760
nobody right as security practitioners

232
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,279
we need to find the issues but we are

233
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,779
never the ones who can actually fix

234
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,100
these things

235
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,260
so we're the discoverers and we help

236
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,500
teams by understanding and responding to

237
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,959
the risk to the threat that we're facing

238
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,220
we're making sure that management is

239
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,320
aware of this

240
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
so how do we do that uh our companies

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,860
trust us to do risk assessments once we

242
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,959
do these risk assessments we get to

243
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,660
propose uh what we should be working on

244
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,459
what things that we should be focusing

245
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,399
on and we agree together

246
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,899
what that is

247
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,640
we start looking at things like control

248
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,740
framers and we look at what are the

249
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,660
controls for our environment mutually

250
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,459
agreed upon controls

251
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,640
that we should be utilizing and then we

252
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,839
analyze against these different

253
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,140
Frameworks so as security practitioners

254
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,720
our job is to be there to serve the

255
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,720
business and to support the business in

256
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,220
improving security

257
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,200
and the sooner we start to figure this

258
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,220
out

259
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,459
the better off we are in our industry

260
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,220
so to accomplish all this our program

261
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,959
needs to be written down

262
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,240
and now only written down but if you

263
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,800
write something and you follow away it's

264
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
just like a pen test report it goes into

265
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,459
a folder somewhere we never look at

266
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,140
again we need to make sure that we're

267
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,940
taking this information and we're

268
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,320
sharing it with our management team

269
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,899
we're saying hey these are the controls

270
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,160
these are the Frameworks for our

271
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,860
organization do you agree does this

272
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,440
sound good are you willing to support me

273
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,040
in helping to achieve these goals

274
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,420
now

275
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,720
at one point I was running the ni uh

276
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
socks on it publicly traded company and

277
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
I was working directly with our third

278
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,100
party audit firm UI uh

279
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,860
to basically validate the controls that

280
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,120
we were testing

281
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,480
and my team would do a first kind of

282
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,399
pass at all of our controls make sure

283
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,200
that we're doing okay if there were

284
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,480
issues we'd identify them up front and

285
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,279
fix those hopefully before the Auditors

286
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,600
came in

287
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,160
but the first thing that happened when

288
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,200
these Auditors came in is they would sit

289
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,160
me down

290
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,019
and they'd have a sheet of paper and it

291
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,120
was literally a checklist they had the

292
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,459
little box do they do this you check yes

293
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,560
or no right it's like do you like me

294
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,399
check yes or no

295
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,120
so we'd sit down with the otter and

296
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,620
you'd go through his checklist and I

297
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,680
he'd be like do you have a firewall yes

298
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,920
you know are you monitoring traffic yes

299
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,160
do you do access controls yes

300
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,440
and so at the end of this

301
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,959
we said yes to everything we got a big

302
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,220
hat on the back

303
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,200
were we ain't more secure from going

304
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,640
through that checklist

305
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,519
definitely not right and I wrote this

306
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,560
blog post about the experience that I

307
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,779
had here it was that Auditors just don't

308
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,839
understand security because any time you

309
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,540
take a checklist approach to security be

310
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,459
that literally going down the checklist

311
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,820
or be that hey we have to do PCI so I'm

312
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,579
only going to do PCI that's not good

313
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,760
security right that is truly a checklist

314
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,040
so just because we say this is our

315
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
framework these are the rules we're

316
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
going to follow that doesn't necessarily

317
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
mean that we're any more secure

318
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,740
than we were the day before

319
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,620
it's kind of funny I uh after I wrote

320
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,060
this post one of those Auditors happened

321
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,599
to see it

322
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,240
and he he said hey hey Josh I saw that

323
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,760
blog post that you wrote he's like do

324
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,380
you really feel that way I was like Alex

325
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,839
yeah I do I was like they literally came

326
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,820
in here with a checklist

327
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,339
can you tell me that they understand the

328
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,839
results of that checklist or were they

329
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,380
just looking for the yes no answers

330
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,519
foreign

331
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,820
so our risk management framework uh this

332
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,860
is a bit of a more visual way of looking

333
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,220
at what we do as Security leaders we run

334
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,320
parts of the company through this kind

335
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,060
of traditional risk management framework

336
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,380
or process

337
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,180
and what's important is that we have a

338
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,120
clear definition of what's done for a

339
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,339
given control because otherwise frankly

340
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,079
the business runs out of patience with

341
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:46,860
us

342
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,079
if we can't tell the business what is

343
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,420
the done state

344
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,360
the question gets asked when will this

345
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,639
stop and my manager literally asked me

346
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,760
that he we were I had this you know big

347
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,560
plan for security and everything else

348
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,720
and I every year I'd ask for more tools

349
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,220
more Technologies and he sat me down

350
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,079
he's like Josh when do we stop paying

351
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:07,980
for stuff

352
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,440
and of course my first thought is this

353
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,139
dumbass yet never

354
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,120
we are going to be paying for stuff year

355
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,100
after year because the threats are

356
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,480
changing

357
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,639
right the environment is changing we're

358
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,680
constantly deploying new stuff and so

359
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,740
I'm always playing from behind

360
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,079
it will never stop

361
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,200
now to try and uh be a little bit more

362
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,779
PC with my manager I said all right how

363
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,459
about we do this we're gonna do a road

364
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,980
mapping exercise so we took the nist

365
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,620
cyber security framework uh we being me

366
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,740
and our internal guy Alex we took the

367
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,839
new CSF framework and we went through

368
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,699
and we said let's do a maturity exercise

369
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,920
let's figure out where we're at today

370
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,560
versus where we want to be and we'll

371
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,899
label this from no we don't do it at all

372
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,180
all the way up to it's an optimized

373
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,040
process we've got auditing in place it's

374
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,839
automated whatever

375
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,880
so we want to try and figure out how

376
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,579
mature we were at these processes

377
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,199
and then ultimately we took those

378
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,199
results and we said if there's a gap

379
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,839
there's a risk and if there's a risk we

380
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,199
need to identify a mitigation how are we

381
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,440
going to fix this particular issue

382
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,579
and so for us this was a

383
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,260
I won't say easy because this literally

384
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,360
took us weeks to put together but it was

385
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,880
a it was a good way for us to show

386
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,320
management

387
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,740
a a thought process behind this we

388
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,899
looked at a framework in this case in

389
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,260
this CSF we applied a methodology

390
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,019
the maturity modeling and we came up

391
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,240
with here's where our gaps are here's

392
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,740
how we're going to address this and we

393
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,320
use that to Define our roadmap these are

394
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,880
the things we're going to work on now of

395
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,160
course I can't do everything right it's

396
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,540
not like we're going to have all this

397
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,160
done by next year but now I can say

398
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,500
these are the themac issues these are

399
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,060
the projects that we need to be working

400
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,980
on

401
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,899
we'll do this one next year we'll do

402
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,760
this one two years here's the cost for

403
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
that and now we actually have a strategy

404
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,180
we have a vision we have something that

405
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,519
we can sell to management about what

406
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,380
we're doing here

407
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,760
now

408
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,740
this is where John comes in and he says

409
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,560
it stops when we meet the bar set by the

410
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,880
control frame so that bar the where

411
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,860
we're going to get to

412
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,760
is not ours to decide SQ practitioners

413
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,240
we can advise we can say hey I think we

414
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,279
should be a level three across the board

415
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,320
because I don't know three is a cool

416
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,540
number it's halfway between one and five

417
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,279
right

418
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,399
but reality is again we don't have the

419
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,139
people we don't have the money

420
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,500
we're trying to help the business and so

421
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,180
we present our bar

422
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,980
to senior leadership

423
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,440
and Leadership then needs to go does

424
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
this make sense are these guys full of

425
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,199
crap right and once leadership approves

426
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,639
hopefully leadership approves if

427
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,260
leadership doesn't approve you may want

428
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,599
to find a new job but once leadership

429
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,880
finally approves and you guys agree on

430
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,059
what the next steps are

431
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,939
now it's your job to meet it we get to

432
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,459
set what we're going to do how to do it

433
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,579
now I want to emphasize that this is not

434
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,760
this is a proposal this is not a

435
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,559
decision by security and I think this is

436
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,020
where a lot of us get wrong oftentimes

437
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,900
we are looking at uh at these control

438
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,580
Frameworks and we say we have to do all

439
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,960
this stuff

440
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,179
this CSF says we must do all this stuff

441
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,299
ISO says we must do all this stuff

442
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,860
we don't

443
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,080
sometimes it's okay not to get the ISO

444
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,240
certification or not to have a hundred

445
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,240
percent CSF compliant it's it's the

446
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,059
world we live in it's it's reality

447
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,640
but we should have a reason for why

448
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,260
we're not mean those things

449
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,440
and maybe even a plan to eventually

450
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,059
address those things sometime in the

451
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,200
future that's our roadmap

452
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,880
all right so which comes first our

453
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,980
business they need a robust scope

454
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,960
control set which is going to map

455
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,320
reasonable to realistic threats or the

456
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,179
controls which are justified by policy

457
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,760
by standards by procedures uh and

458
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,280
supported by guidelines

459
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,020
so some people are going to assert that

460
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,059
we need policy and procedure first

461
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,940
usually the Auditors by the way

462
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,000
uh others say we need the controls and

463
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,340
it's kind of an age-old argument and the

464
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,799
reality is the answer is both

465
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,240
it's kind of a trick question because it

466
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,799
really doesn't matter which one comes

467
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,120
first and you're kind of going to

468
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,940
alternate between modifying both of them

469
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,220
but the bottom line here is that your

470
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,340
business looks to you to establish

471
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,380
strong governance Foundation that is our

472
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,020
role of security and so it's our job to

473
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,539
use these security control Frameworks

474
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,160
and the policies and the guidelines and

475
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,240
standards to support them that's our job

476
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,520
so we want to identify and communicate

477
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,020
the risk

478
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,720
and that's part of having a strong risk

479
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,880
management program and all of our

480
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,160
Associated processes are key so how do

481
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,320
we track which decisions are being made

482
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,600
and who's making the decisions because I

483
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,340
said hey we're going to assess we're

484
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,500
going to convey but it's not our job to

485
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,559
accept so how do we track that

486
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,120
well

487
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,160
um they're going to keep saying no until

488
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,039
you figure out this way right and the

489
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,419
reason why they're going to keep saying

490
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,880
no is because we don't have the context

491
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,940
around the decisions that the executives

492
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,140
are making

493
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,120
you don't know the issues they're facing

494
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
sometimes it's better not to know to be

495
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,679
honest with you it's not that they don't

496
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,380
value security most cases

497
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,539
but rather that in the context of

498
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,700
everything else security may or may not

499
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,919
be the priority

500
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,780
and this is really where you as a

501
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,240
security leader can Define yourself

502
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,179
you can complain you can whine

503
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,600
or you can accept that the answer is no

504
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
and try to come up with an alternative

505
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,280
to compensate for that

506
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,520
and it might not be full migration

507
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,860
but it might help to reduce the risk to

508
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,380
an acceptable level and that's really

509
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,179
all risk management is it's figuring out

510
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,460
what the issues are and how do we put

511
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,700
this into a a place how do we mitigate

512
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,799
to the point where we're okay with

513
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,919
accepting whoever that risk is

514
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,020
and there's an interesting quote here at

515
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,799
the bottom no is not a Terminus it's a

516
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,299
junction

517
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,820
so just because they say no

518
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,039
doesn't mean that the conversation is

519
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,660
over

520
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,240
mitigating this completely is not our

521
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,500
only solution

522
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,720
so we can look at how do we partially

523
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
mitigate this how do we transfer the

524
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,179
risk should we improve our monitoring

525
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,980
there's lots of different things that we

526
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,160
can do even with that no answer that are

527
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,320
productive for the organizations and

528
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,700
show the value of us as security

529
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,760
practitioners

530
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,559
all right

531
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,919
let's talk about tools and tricks

532
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,760
so this is how we get rid of the atlas

533
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,720
syndrome

534
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,380
now we want Creator uh strong governance

535
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,020
Foundation use our control Frameworks we

536
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,460
want to develop a strong risk management

537
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,580
process that's easy to understand for us

538
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,700
to follow when four separate roles for

539
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,200
risk assessment conveyance and

540
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
acceptance you want to enable the

541
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,280
business to make informed risk-based

542
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,659
decisions

543
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,600
now the business is probably going to

544
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
fight you on this

545
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,900
they're going to fight you on this

546
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,780
because now they have to accept the

547
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,080
responsibility for saying no

548
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,900
when the business tells you sorry we

549
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,400
don't have the people we don't have the

550
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,679
money to be able to fix this thing and

551
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,299
you go hey I need you to assign your

552
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,280
name here

553
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,159
they're going to fight you

554
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,799
and they'll probably also fight you the

555
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,200
first time you document their decision

556
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,020
to not fix something because up until

557
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,900
this point it's been a conversation in

558
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,020
some conference room somewhere or maybe

559
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,080
maybe you got in writing an email but

560
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,140
they're usually smarter than that

561
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,179
but once we get a risk management

562
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,640
program in place

563
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,919
and we Define this as our corporate

564
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,960
process

565
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,059
it sets us up to have the right

566
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,880
conversations and have the right people

567
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,440
being the ones who are accepting this

568
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,900
responsibility

569
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,820
you guys ever seen a spreadsheet like

570
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,980
this

571
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,600
if you look up like Risk Management

572
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,460
spreadsheet it looks like this online

573
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,860
you'll get dozens of templates that look

574
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,659
exactly like this and I will tell you

575
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,580
there's nothing really wrong with this

576
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,400
spreadsheet well there's I'll talk in a

577
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,539
second about all the things that are

578
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,039
wrong with the spreadsheet but you can

579
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,380
you can use this spreadsheet right there

580
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,240
you you can certainly put this to work

581
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,100
and you can use this to enter your risk

582
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,799
and things like that but

583
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,760
spreadsheets

584
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,539
spreadsheets don't scale

585
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,200
um

586
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,600
spreadsheet that has a dozen risks for a

587
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,480
single team it might be manageable when

588
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,980
I first started out my risk management

589
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,820
program I had an Excel spreadsheet and

590
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,240
when it was two three ten risks it

591
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,740
wasn't a big deal

592
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,900
but once you're trying to manage

593
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,419
hundreds or thousands of risks across

594
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,820
multiple teams it truly becomes unwieldy

595
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,220
having multiple people adding the same

596
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,760
spreadsheet at the same time is a recipe

597
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,340
for disaster and worse yet how do you

598
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,620
maintain an Enterprise approach to risk

599
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,299
management while ensuring that one team

600
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,520
doesn't see another team's risk

601
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,700
right do you have a separate spreadsheet

602
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,340
for every team

603
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,720
I don't know

604
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,880
so the second item here a spreadsheet

605
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,120
isn't a database fact right you can do

606
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,159
pivot tables in Excel you can do some

607
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,620
fancy formulas some magic you can join

608
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,900
data from distinct tables it's difficult

609
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,940
but it's not impossible

610
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,440
but

611
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,720
in simple risk in the application that I

612
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,059
wrote database queries can sometimes

613
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,820
span a dozen or more tables

614
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,880
and that takes a fraction of a second

615
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,220
so there's really no substitute for the

616
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,679
efficiency and the scale of a database

617
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,480
we're joining multiple distinct sets of

618
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,179
data is concerned you just can't do it

619
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,120
with a spreadsheet and then third

620
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
when you have a spreadsheet it requires

621
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,080
a considerable amount of Maintenance

622
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,140
those who fall into the spreadsheet

623
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,880
approach to risk management will usually

624
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,100
spend as much time tweaking their

625
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,480
spreadsheet and messing with their

626
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,640
formulas as they do actually managing

627
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,820
risk and so each new report that you

628
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,799
want to add requires a substantial

629
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,780
investment in terms of time to create it

630
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,580
and ends up really being a waste of

631
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,100
resources they're far better utilized

632
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,080
elsewhere in their organization well

633
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,700
let's face it most of us they're

634
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,520
managing risk are really part-time Risk

635
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,740
Managers we've got other things to do

636
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,840
with our time and the risk management is

637
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,459
just another thing on our plates

638
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,159
so once I realized that my spreadsheets

639
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,480
wouldn't work

640
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,919
um I actually used a homegrown lowest

641
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,159
notes database for risk management

642
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,039
yeah that was fun

643
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,440
Lois notes can do that it's uh

644
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,080
yeah

645
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,600
all right next

646
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,179
um so in any case our ideal solution

647
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:43,980
here what we really want to get to is

648
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,200
something that's just as effective at

649
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,059
thousands of risks across multiple teams

650
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,740
we want something that's going to scale

651
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,539
for our organization

652
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,400
we want something that allows multiple

653
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,740
people to perform risk management tasks

654
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,299
at the same time

655
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,159
there's going to be multiple teams that

656
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,539
are using this

657
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,760
we want reporting that rapidly combines

658
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,279
multiple different data sets and we want

659
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,960
something that allows us to focus our

660
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,000
limited time on actually managing risk

661
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,679
and not managing the platform that

662
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,419
manages risks

663
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,200
and so again this is where not having

664
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,600
John here really hurts because now I'm

665
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,940
the vendor he's the customer he's the

666
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,200
guy who gets to talk to you about this

667
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,900
but while I truly believe in the power

668
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,260
of using a tool like Sim Forest I I'm

669
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,940
also not a big fan of promoting it

670
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,659
during a talk now I will say it's free

671
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,700
um but it's much nicer to hear it from

672
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,220
the user of it than the guy who wrote it

673
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,620
right I'm the bias here

674
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,640
um

675
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,500
thank you James

676
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,360
he was supposed to be heckling me I

677
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,220
don't know what happened

678
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,840
um we're going to walk through the risk

679
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,400
management process we're going to talk

680
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,720
about this I'm going to take you through

681
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,820
the process of making risk we're going

682
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,159
to get rid of the atlas syndrome and

683
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,600
figure out how do we involve Management

684
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,640
in the process and that's really the

685
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,200
piece I want you guys to take away here

686
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,179
yes you could certainly download SIM for

687
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,159
us you can use it it's free it's open

688
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,640
source but any other tool any other

689
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,799
platform should be able to do the exact

690
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,679
same thing

691
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,900
uh so let's talk governance we talked

692
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,059
earlier about the the strong governance

693
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:21,960
function our controls and so we want to

694
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,940
be able to either add our own custom

695
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,679
controls and Frameworks into the system

696
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,440
or maybe leverage something else

697
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,480
and if you've never heard of it there's

698
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,880
actually this framework it's a free

699
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,200
framework you can download it from

700
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,480
securecontrolsframework.com

701
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,860
um it's called the secure controls

702
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,900
framework and it's a common control

703
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,400
framework it's got over a thousand

704
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,200
security and privacy related controls

705
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,659
that have been mapped across 190

706
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,760
different Frameworks and that includes

707
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,900
things like nist ISO PCI gdpr HIPAA like

708
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,960
big long list 190 different Frameworks

709
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,299
so if you're an organization that either

710
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,580
needs to uh

711
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,340
leverage multiple Frameworks so maybe

712
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,140
you're like or ISO but we're also in a

713
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,960
CSF shot and by the way cmmc is part of

714
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,400
our organization too

715
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,679
compliance Forge is cool because you can

716
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,779
set a single set of controls you can

717
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,159
Define which controls you're going to

718
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,380
use and then those will map across all

719
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,580
the other different Frameworks so I'll

720
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,440
show you a cool picture of that in a sec

721
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,059
but it also really helps if you're

722
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:23,820
moving from one framework to another so

723
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,600
like ISO 27001 the 2013 version was like

724
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,120
the thing for the past decade and then

725
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,400
all of a sudden we've got the 2022 and

726
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,900
you want to figure out which controls

727
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,480
are new which things have changed and it

728
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,360
helps us to do that

729
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,919
uh

730
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,559
number of controls

731
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,360
how many controls should an organization

732
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,740
have

733
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,559
Let's uh let's take a quick poll

734
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,900
should an organization have

735
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,700
20 controls

736
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,059
at least 20 controls

737
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,159
yeah all right all right I'm with you

738
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,980
what about 50 controls should we have at

739
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,100
least 50 controls

740
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,799
nobody what one a couple all right cool

741
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,559
100 controls

742
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,860
300 controls should we have all thousand

743
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,659
SCF controls

744
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,100
oh no

745
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,200
what I can tell you is that a lot of

746
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,720
these Frameworks that you get like a PCI

747
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,179
framework you got like 300 controls

748
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,380
right and so my advice to you around the

749
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,919
control piece is don't look at as entire

750
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,559
framework look at in terms of which are

751
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,600
the things that we value for our

752
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,700
security program which of these controls

753
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,200
are the things that's going to add value

754
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,260
to our organization to our teams and

755
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,700
start there

756
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,279
and you can re-evaluate a layer point

757
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,559
maybe you're like eh full disk

758
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,940
encryption we don't really need that

759
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,100
right now but you know let's let's talk

760
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,539
about it down the road that's a big

761
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,600
project we'll deal with it then

762
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,120
so for me

763
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,640
each control should allow me to map my

764
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,260
current and my desired maturity levels

765
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,179
it's that exercise that I talked about

766
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,880
before that Alex and I did to do Road

767
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,919
mapping to show our management this is

768
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,240
what we're going to do

769
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,340
and then if we have a nice little spider

770
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,799
chart like this we can use this as the

771
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,020
roadmap for our security program we can

772
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,299
say hey we're doing really really well

773
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,100
at Asset Management I don't think we

774
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,980
need any more investments in that but

775
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,179
guess what secure engineering and

776
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,500
architecture maybe we should hire

777
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,760
somebody who actually knows what he's

778
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,200
doing because I don't

779
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,120
all right let's let's hire somebody to

780
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,559
help us out there because the the

781
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,580
numbers don't lie

782
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,940
now risk management process uh for me

783
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,080
when I first started my information

784
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,940
security program

785
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,000
um I came across nist 800-30 uh if

786
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,140
you're looking for some like bedtime

787
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,659
reading material it's great uh it's like

788
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,120
100 pages long and it'll put you asleep

789
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,539
but the the basics of it are pretty

790
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,220
simple

791
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,559
we have a risk registry we want to make

792
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,059
sure that every risk that we're finding

793
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,919
is getting into a system where we can

794
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,960
track it that's the first piece

795
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,059
assessing the risk

796
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,919
then from there once we have it in a

797
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,440
risk registry we need to say what are we

798
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,059
going to do we're going to plan our

799
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,200
mitigation

800
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,700
now in terms of what we're going to do

801
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,100
the answer might be hey we're just going

802
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,840
to watch this maybe we're going to

803
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,980
transfer the risk we're going to buy

804
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,899
some insurance for that thing

805
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:29,340
maybe we're going to actually fix it

806
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,260
the next piece here is to accept that

807
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,600
mitigation to to say yes

808
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
mitigation valid we agree management is

809
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,580
on board we're going to bless it with

810
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,320
the money the people to make this thing

811
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,659
happen

812
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:44,880
uh then management goes they do the

813
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,399
review that's the blessing piece and

814
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,059
then

815
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,159
risk management is a cyclical process

816
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,720
that that's the reason these arrows go

817
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,159
all the way around by the way cyclical

818
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,679
uh risk management is a cyclical process

819
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,840
so we don't just review our risk once

820
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,120
and then forget about them we need to

821
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,620
make sure that we are re-reviewing our

822
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,299
risks on a regular basis now why do we

823
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,880
do that because risk changes because

824
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,460
environments change that risk that we

825
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,919
found a year ago might not be valid

826
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,059
anymore

827
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,820
that risk that we found a day ago might

828
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,240
be really really uh worse in three

829
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,240
months because uh back then it was in no

830
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,860
day it was just like a proof of concept

831
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,539
wherever and all of a sudden there's a

832
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,100
worm that's uh running around on the

833
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,179
internet

834
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:30,500
our risks are going to change

835
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,460
uh

836
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,260
I was having a conversation with John

837
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,000
about this when we were preparing for

838
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
our presentation for besides Vancouver

839
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and he said ah he's like tracking wrists

840
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,399
is kind of like jira for security I was

841
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,679
like that you're you're right man like

842
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,399
the very simple risk management workflow

843
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,500
uh gives us a simple intuitive air face

844
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,500
we like create our ticket right and then

845
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,419
we say this is how I'm gonna fix that

846
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:59,940
thing and then we drive that to closure

847
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,919
like Risk Management is jira for

848
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,880
security duh

849
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,559
uh so this is where we plan our

850
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,020
mitigations we make sure that hey we

851
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,640
understand this risk this thing that was

852
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,200
submitted and we're going to say this is

853
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,820
how we're going to fix it

854
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,799
now

855
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,320
interesting uh this verse right here

856
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,179
this is a 10. this is like the worst

857
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,760
thing and and arsenic talked yesterday a

858
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,620
little bit about this idea of like was

859
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,459
it 10 really mean

860
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,659
I think that you can answer that

861
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,580
question but I think the way that you

862
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,960
answer that question is with

863
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,460
contextualization

864
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,820
in when we look at our organization

865
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,200
oftentimes as security practitioners we

866
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,519
throw a 10 out there and we see if it

867
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,539
sticks to the wall because it's

868
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,519
something that we feel is bad but if

869
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,820
that 10 is on a non-production system uh

870
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,860
something that you know very few people

871
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,200
touch maybe it's protected by some other

872
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,179
compensating control something like that

873
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,000
is it really a tent just because the cve

874
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,860
score says it's a 10 doesn't mean it's a

875
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,600
10. right

876
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,760
and when we look at it in terms of the

877
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,399
bigger picture here so if we look at in

878
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:08,460
terms of our Enterprise the real risk

879
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,800
that everybody is worrying about

880
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,240
is cve

881
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:17,339
2018-0123 is that really the biggest

882
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,800
issue that we face

883
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,139
or do we have to worry about like oh

884
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,418
making payroll next month because we

885
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,480
don't have enough customers

886
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,599
right we our business faces much bigger

887
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,480
risks than we're privy to

888
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,639
so we need to contextualize this we need

889
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,139
to look at that and say

890
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,239
yeah that's not really a 10. that's on

891
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,460
one system it affects one user who logs

892
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,739
into that system occasionally

893
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:46,638
that's a two

894
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,839
either way we need to make sure that

895
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,339
we're documenting the decision-making

896
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:56,060
process how did we come to this decision

897
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,660
making sure that we're performing

898
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,480
reviews so we can't really expect

899
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,280
management to like sign off on this

900
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,080
thing if they're not involved if

901
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,700
everything that we do is we assess the

902
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,980
risk and we say like here's the problem

903
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,220
maybe we send them like that uh send

904
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,839
them the email that says like here's the

905
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,720
vulnerability report right

906
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,520
we want to make sure the management is

907
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,079
involved in the process that they

908
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,380
understand the issue that you assessed

909
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,420
that they're aware of the risks that are

910
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,579
involved

911
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,800
and now you let them make the informed

912
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,000
decisions about that particular risk

913
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,140
now

914
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,820
I like to think of risk management kind

915
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,220
of like a pyramid I I put this report

916
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,040
into simplest years ago and it's like

917
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,200
stupid simple right it's like you know

918
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,760
just tell me how many risks at each

919
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,040
level but every time I looked at this

920
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,140
report I was like I've got this tiny

921
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,760
little Capstone at the top and I've got

922
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,380
a few more and a few more and a few more

923
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,839
and it made this pyramid I was like

924
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,579
brilliant

925
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:59,099
so most organizations it's going to look

926
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,599
exactly like this you have the heavy

927
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,760
bottom with less worse at the top and I

928
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,460
was like how do I how do I span this out

929
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,500
how do I make everybody in my

930
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,940
organization all the management people

931
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,500
involved in this process sounds like

932
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,579
boom

933
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,300
management is a freaking pyramid

934
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,339
so let's use that to our advantage and

935
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,720
when we start building out our

936
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,160
responsibilities and things like that

937
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,859
let's assign the different review levels

938
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,599
for the different risks to the different

939
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,160
levels of management

940
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,980
I was like cool my managers you can

941
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,960
review the the low and insignificant

942
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,579
level Risk by the way those are the

943
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:33,839
people that have the money and the the

944
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,119
people resources to fix those things

945
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,160
then I'd say the section managers you

946
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,960
guys review the medium level risk my

947
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,119
directors review the high and the VP

948
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,460
reviews the very high level is so now

949
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,380
we've taken advantage of this like I

950
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,480
don't know scale we have this cool

951
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,400
pyramid with our management we like slap

952
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,900
our risk management thing right on top

953
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,940
of it and we go all right VP you see

954
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,560
these like five risks that are seeing at

955
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,579
the top

956
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,200
tell us what we should do about those

957
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,000
things those are your purview those are

958
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,240
things that you're responsible for

959
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,460
now we can also decide which users can

960
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,619
create risks or who can modify risk

961
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,720
things like that now my advice here and

962
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,740
what I did when I was at National

963
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,180
instruments

964
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,180
is I thought why should I restrict

965
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,660
anybody from creating a risk

966
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,640
I mean after all my job is to assess

967
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,380
risk so if I'm putting like these

968
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,660
artificial Inhibitors between me and

969
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,220
actually figuring out what the risks are

970
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,800
like that's kind of dumb right

971
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,020
so I said everybody in my organization

972
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,579
has the ability to log into the platform

973
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,079
and create risks

974
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,420
because I want that Unix admin who finds

975
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,579
like the uncrypted SSH key at like two

976
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,200
o'clock in the morning I want him to be

977
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,940
able to create that risk and go right

978
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,380
back on to what he was doing but now I

979
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,180
have that placeholder I have something

980
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,859
that we can go back to later on and say

981
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:50,839
all right cool tell me more

982
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,040
uh mitigations so

983
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,320
try doing mitigations in Excel by the

984
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,140
way how are you going to fix these risks

985
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,940
so for every one of the risks that we

986
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,339
found we need to basically say like this

987
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,040
risk maps to this control or maybe we

988
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,540
need to add this control in place

989
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,640
whatever it is

990
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,160
we need to be able to say this is how we

991
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,740
fix the risk

992
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,300
so

993
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,820
in terms of making informed decisions

994
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,220
about the risks that are out there our

995
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,260
goal after all is to enable the business

996
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,359
to make informed risk-based decisions

997
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,280
like I said earlier

998
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,380
so one of the ways that we can do this

999
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,720
is we can evaluate the biggest risk for

1000
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,040
our organization

1001
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,260
and so we want to look at kind of The

1002
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,000
Ordering of our risks and we look at the

1003
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,740
highest level risk the critical risk in

1004
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,180
our organization

1005
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,599
now tarsenic's point yesterday

1006
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,780
the stuff that bubbles up like

1007
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,599
is it a 10 I don't know but the stuff

1008
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,700
that bubbles up to the top should be the

1009
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,060
highest priority and after all this is

1010
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,160
really a prioritization process it

1011
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,780
doesn't really matter what that score is

1012
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,520
what matters is the fact that it's the

1013
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,079
highest one up there

1014
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,820
right those are the ones we need to

1015
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,500
figure out

1016
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,240
but that's not the only way we can look

1017
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,820
at our risks so we can also look at

1018
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,000
appetite every organization has a

1019
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,380
different level of risk appetite

1020
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,359
and so if I can say my risk appetite is

1021
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,400
I don't want to have risks that are like

1022
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,859
uh higher than a seven

1023
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,260
then I can report on that and say all

1024
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,579
right here's all the risks that are

1025
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,140
higher than seven

1026
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,119
what should we do about these how do we

1027
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,760
lower the risk maybe not mitigate but

1028
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,920
how do we reduce the risk for this

1029
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,079
particular thing lower the likelihood

1030
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,640
lower the impact of this particular

1031
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,060
issue

1032
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,839
and then we can make decisions based on

1033
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:51,180
the level of effort as well

1034
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,400
so still looking at the prioritization

1035
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,900
and what's the highest issues in my

1036
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,119
environment but now I look at

1037
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,160
that's a trivial thing to fix you told

1038
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,240
me it's going to take you like five

1039
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,980
minutes to do that and it's a 10 risk

1040
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,180
score

1041
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,760
why wouldn't we do that like you know

1042
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,619
I'll give you an extra five minutes on

1043
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,940
your lunch break go make it happen

1044
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,540
and we can tie our wrists back to our

1045
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,660
organizational controls and say Here's a

1046
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,180
control here's all the risks that are

1047
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,859
associated with that control so if you

1048
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:24,900
want to tell me like hey that's not key

1049
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,180
control I can tell you why it is because

1050
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,440
these are all the risks that we're

1051
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,780
making that we're mitigating as a result

1052
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,820
of that control the cool thing is you

1053
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,680
can also flip this chart over and you

1054
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,180
can say show me each risk and all the

1055
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,859
controls that are associated with it and

1056
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:39,420
this is a great way to identify a lack

1057
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,920
of defense and death

1058
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,900
so if I look at a risk and I see a

1059
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,160
single controller it's like web

1060
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,540
application firewall that's all I'm

1061
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,619
doing

1062
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,180
man maybe I should start doing some

1063
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,220
encryption or something else to kind of

1064
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,780
bolster that control set because if one

1065
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,619
thing fails that thing right there

1066
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,500
so now our management has the context

1067
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,960
that it needs to make decisions they've

1068
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,540
got reporting they understand what our

1069
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,700
appetite is they understand what the

1070
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,260
highest level risk in our environment

1071
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,720
they understand the controls that we've

1072
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,540
implemented where they're failing they

1073
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,060
understand it all and now management can

1074
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,520
make these informed decisions about how

1075
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,740
do we treat the risk and we have a

1076
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,000
platform that we can use to actually

1077
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,160
communicate it across the business

1078
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,040
that's it

1079
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,500
that was easy yeah so the the question

1080
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,380
is hey you you're you're trying to tell

1081
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,140
management to like sign here and how do

1082
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,599
we overcome that how do we make how do

1083
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,220
we turn that like no I don't want to do

1084
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,400
it into yes like okay and it's actually

1085
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,700
starts with management support uh when I

1086
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,900
was doing this at National instruments

1087
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,520
one of the things that I did first and

1088
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,099
foremost is I went to each of the

1089
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,260
managers not the teams I started at the

1090
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,359
management level and I said hey

1091
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,480
this is what risk management is and I

1092
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,280
talked to them about the process you and

1093
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,260
we create risks we plan migations we

1094
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,420
perform reviews and then what I told

1095
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,520
management was look right now these

1096
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,260
risks they're skeletons in your closet

1097
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,839
they're bad things waiting to happen

1098
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:14,520
and our goal with this risk management

1099
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,800
process is to get those skeletons out of

1100
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,480
the closet we want to bring them forward

1101
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,579
we want to put them into a place where

1102
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,740
now you have visibility

1103
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,359
and that's the thing that management

1104
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,339
lacks today if you don't have a risk

1105
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:28,619
management process is the visibility you

1106
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:30,780
can't make informed risk-based decisions

1107
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,720
on problems in your environment if you

1108
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,980
don't have visibility into the issues

1109
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,000
that you're supposed to be making the

1110
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,380
decisions on

1111
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,300
so if we can get those issues out of

1112
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,339
that closet put them into a registry and

1113
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:43,740
start to actually plan migations

1114
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,960
we're better off for it and that's how

1115
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,060
we convince our management now the flip

1116
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,119
side to that is the people because you

1117
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,099
got convinced that the the individual

1118
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,800
contributors the employees to do this

1119
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,680
thing too and the way you do that is you

1120
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,760
tell them hey

1121
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,500
right now all these issues that you're

1122
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,520
finding

1123
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,619
that's the atlas syndrome that's the

1124
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,420
weight on your shoulders and everybody

1125
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,280
goes yeah you know I found that issue

1126
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,020
but you know I figured if I told

1127
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,220
somebody they wouldn't do anything about

1128
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,440
it anyways so I just kind of kept it to

1129
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,940
myself

1130
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,400
and ultimately that means that if that

1131
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,960
issue comes to fruition it's their about

1132
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,400
that's on the line that's like the thing

1133
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,859
that's going to get them fired and so if

1134
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:24,960
we can tell them hey

1135
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,400
well I'll

1136
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,859
tell you guys a story so I was hanging

1137
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:31,200
out with uh one of our Unix admins and

1138
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,520
he said Josh

1139
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,079
I feel kind of like I'm at the doctor

1140
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,240
with my pants around my ankles right I'm

1141
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm showing you the goods I'm telling

1142
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,960
you everything that's wrong here what

1143
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,700
are you gonna do for me Josh

1144
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,460
I said look these issues right now

1145
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,800
they're you're burned to bear

1146
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,560
my promise to you is that if we can take

1147
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,960
these issues if you help me to collect

1148
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,760
these risks to put them into our

1149
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,460
registry my promise to you is that

1150
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,099
management will see them not only that

1151
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,839
but management is going to make a

1152
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,839
decision about what to do with this

1153
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,579
maybe that decision is we're not going

1154
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,319
to do anything at all but I will make

1155
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,740
sure that management sees this and makes

1156
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,720
a decision about what to do

1157
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,760
and so for the individual contributors
