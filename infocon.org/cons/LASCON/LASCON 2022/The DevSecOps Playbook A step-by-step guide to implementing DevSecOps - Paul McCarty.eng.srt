00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,280
g'day everybody my name is Paul McCarty

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,660
I'm

8
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,780
I am the that good looking guy right

9
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,619
there I am the CEO of secure stack

10
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:07,320
secure stack is a startup based in

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,659
Australia now I might not sound

12
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,820
Australian that's because I'm not I'm

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,140
from Detroit

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,360
but I've lived most of my life in Utah

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,220
I met an Australian girl and I moved to

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,799
Australia in 2016 and I started secure

17
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,540
stack in 2017.

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,640
um we were based on the lovely Gold

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,159
Coast in Queensland

20
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,140
um I'm there with my wife and my three

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,420
kids and my team is on the Gold Coast

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,640
with me there

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,200
um I have been in the game a long time

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,079
don't let the baby face foia I've been

25
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,000
in the game

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,820
31 years this year I know surprise him

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,680
right

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,299
um 31 years I started out in the early

29
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,079
90s um and I started out originally as a

30
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,020
Unix admin right way back in the sun OS

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,520
days and um

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,820
and somehow quickly found myself in an

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,880
early burgeoning Linux kind of um

34
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,100
firewall and and

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,159
um security space and my career has gone

36
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,020
on as I'm sure all your careers have

37
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,419
done in the varying pivots and ticks and

38
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,679
tacks

39
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,260
um I've spent roughly about half of my

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,800
career working for large organizations

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,480
and the other half of my career working

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,700
for startups including my own well

43
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,140
actually including multiples of my own

44
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,400
and I've seen the challenges we're going

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,720
to talk about today

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,300
both for those larger organizations and

47
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,879
for those smaller organizations

48
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,760
um my specialty nowadays or before I

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,959
started secure stack was helping

50
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,819
organizations like some of the ones you

51
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,160
see up there build secure application

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,739
infrastructure at scale so I was an

53
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,379
early proponent of puppet and ansible

54
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,420
and things like that like I'm sure many

55
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,400
of you were and that really kind of

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,379
changed my career it allowed us to take

57
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,060
deployment times for applications from

58
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,500
when I was at Blue Cross Blue Shield

59
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,140
with one of our main applications the

60
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,840
deployment would typically start at nine

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,760
o'clock on a Friday and all those

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,220
suckers that were on on call that

63
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,440
weekend would all be on that crappy

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,860
phone call right for hours right until

65
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,900
the DBA is at the end of this long

66
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,940
complicated process

67
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,060
deploy the database changes

68
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,739
hopefully you crossed your fingers and

69
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,959
the database gods were happy and it all

70
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,760
worked and um

71
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,500
that typically would take seven or eight

72
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,239
hours through the middle of night which

73
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,500
sucked

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,819
um especially after you had kids and

75
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,980
families in regular lives which most of

76
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,140
us did and then something like ansible

77
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,940
or public came along and allowed us to

78
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,400
take that whole night process with like

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,220
20 some people and bring it down to an

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,620
hour with two people

81
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,000
um and that changed my career and that's

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,620
my jam

83
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,900
so we're here today to talk about the

84
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,299
devsecops Playbook that's a little thing

85
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,860
that I wrote

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,760
um and it it comes out of my background

87
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,580
in building devops and now I don't want

88
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,500
to say devops and devsecops teams

89
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,480
because that's really not what they

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,799
should call the teams but that's where

91
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,540
we are right how many people in the room

92
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,420
right now have worked for a devops team

93
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,099
anybody

94
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,639
one two three four five six maybe

95
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,600
um

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,339
I'm not gonna fight that battle there's

97
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,720
many battles that are not worth fighting

98
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
that ain't one of them

99
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,320
um the uh the the issue though is that

100
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,820
um we have a problem

101
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,100
and we still have that same problem

102
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,380
after very after many years and and the

103
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,240
devsecop's Playbook was my attempt at

104
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,520
coming up with a solution for myself

105
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,919
and ultimately that solution

106
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,080
is something that I could then expose to

107
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,300
other people and that's what I've done

108
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,360
um basically the devastick Ops Playbook

109
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
started out as a list of tasks that

110
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,100
organically grew

111
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,860
as my career progressed over the last 10

112
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,660
years or whatever

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,600
um and grew and groom grew and and kind

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,560
of spanned a wide variety of roles in

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,180
the industry

116
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,979
um that now we kind of bundled together

117
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,160
as this thing called devsecops

118
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,660
The devsecops Playbook is really about

119
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,060
building a minimally viable Baseline for

120
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,880
y'all for you specific for you and your

121
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,880
applications and your teams

122
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,380
um as I said I've been doing this for a

123
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,880
long time

124
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,280
um and the problem hasn't really gotten

125
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,380
a ton better over the last 20 years

126
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,520
um you can make arguments that in some

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,080
places it has but

128
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,680
um

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,380
the problem ultimately comes down to the

130
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,180
fact that

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,220
humans are humans

132
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,139
and

133
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,699
we say that we want to collaborate and

134
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,039
work together but ultimately we often

135
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,840
don't right why because I have my own

136
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
territory and my own things I have my

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,380
own toys and I don't want to play with

138
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,699
them

139
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,139
um but unfortunately after all these

140
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:52,940
years

141
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,000
we still kind of have a problem with

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,919
deploying secure applications now I said

143
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,680
earlier that I've worked a lot with

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,500
startups and Enterprise something I want

145
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
to say early on is that I built the

146
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,600
devsecops Playbook to be usable by any

147
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
size organization right the the

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
requirements for those different

149
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,139
organizations are really different right

150
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,699
just makes sense startup is going to

151
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:18,720
have very different requirements than

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
Enterprise

153
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,699
will have issues around compliance and

154
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,740
other things that startups really don't

155
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,720
think about because they are concerned

156
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,039
about surviving

157
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,780
startups often especially the smaller

158
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,819
they are are concerned about simply

159
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,160
surviving so for them if you're like

160
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,560
compliance or surviving which one are

161
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,419
they going to choose right

162
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,460
um so the Dem stick Ops Playbook had to

163
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,860
take that into account

164
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,960
um they have different types of teams

165
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,780
Enterprises have security teams and

166
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,940
operations teams and and Engineering

167
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,100
teams startups usually have a ton of

168
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,240
Developers

169
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,180
and maybe one security person and not

170
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,639
very many Ops people at all it's just

171
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,560
kind of the kind of standard makeup of

172
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,660
the average startup but regardless of

173
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,520
how they are laid out I wanted the

174
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,859
devsecops Playbook to map to all of them

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,560
evidence of the problem there's I picked

176
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,080
four but if given time I probably could

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,600
come up with like a thousand right but

178
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,240
evidence of the problem is that

179
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,940
because the cloud has come along and

180
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,099
give given developers oh I should

181
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,180
probably not move around because of

182
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,380
video huh

183
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,080
you got me cool sweet let me do the

184
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,479
Eddie Murphy right back and forth

185
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,259
um so the software engineering teams

186
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,639
often have direct access to the cloud

187
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,380
and for Enterprise organizations you

188
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,580
might have controls around that you

189
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,020
might have guardrails around that but I

190
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,460
can tell you for startups and scale-ups

191
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,160
they don't they absolutely do not or

192
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,259
typically they don't uh which means that

193
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,139
the engineers who often don't have a

194
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,199
background in security or operations

195
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,199
have unfettered access to to the cloud

196
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,660
um unfortunately infosec teams have not

197
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,740
joined

198
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,900
the devops

199
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,720
um kind of mandate and culture right and

200
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,860
that's a problem and we'll talk about

201
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,599
that a little bit later

202
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,259
um

203
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,120
and the reality is that we're deploying

204
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
faster than we ever have before when I

205
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,819
was at Blue Cross Blue Shield and we

206
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,699
deployed that monolithic app once a

207
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,440
month or once a quarter

208
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,220
that's ancient that's archaic right now

209
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,199
one of our startups at secure stack

210
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,080
deploys over 80 times a day to prod

211
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,899
right once a month or once a quarter

212
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,159
versus 80 times a day can any anybody in

213
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,240
the room by the way I want this to be

214
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,339
interactive so if you have if you

215
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,599
disagree with me if you got a question

216
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,940
please shout those out I I like

217
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,140
interacting with the audience that's

218
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,700
that's kind of that's kind of my

219
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,620
preferred way to do this but has anybody

220
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,140
in the or in in the room today seen

221
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,660
somebody deploy more than 80 times a day

222
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,540
that's not Google

223
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,480
it's a lot huh so that changes the model

224
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,700
that we have to use right

225
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,519
um and finally that this idea there's

226
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,680
this weird kind of thing that's like if

227
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
containers or serverless are only around

228
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,820
for a minute or 10 minutes or whatever

229
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,160
it is this short period of time that we

230
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,399
don't have to secure them right a great

231
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,980
example of that is that I commonly see

232
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,980
when I look at a workload okay mate

233
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,620
when I look at a workload the container

234
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,360
that the the is being used or the

235
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,220
runtime is being used for that process

236
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,000
is old right it's not ancient but it

237
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,240
ain't new and that's a problem right we

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
have this idea that if something's going

239
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,420
to be short-lived as part of a CI CD

240
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,980
pipeline or whatever the case may be

241
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,080
that we don't have to secure it and

242
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,620
that's a problem

243
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,779
so I know I'm not going to bludgeon you

244
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,000
with Statistics but the reality is that

245
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,700
um in this environment where

246
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,339
um security hasn't joined the devops

247
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,959
kind of movement

248
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,940
um and where Engineers are able to often

249
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,320
deploy

250
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,880
um to the cloud directly

251
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
we just have a lot of problems that come

252
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,700
out of that right

253
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,860
um That Number 96 of the cloud breaches

254
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,420
being self-inflicted that's actually a

255
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,420
lot higher it's 99 now so the reality is

256
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,060
that what we're doing now is just kind

257
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,060
of sprawl right it's just sprawl at

258
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,160
scale

259
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,800
so let's talk about why we're in this

260
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,140
position that we are today so first and

261
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,040
foremost

262
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,779
we have to assume who in this room

263
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,899
started out as a software engineer

264
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,920
ah boom yes I like it

265
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,700
um

266
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,680
software engineers

267
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,740
provide value to the business in the

268
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,160
form of features and functionality right

269
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,160
and because of that security is always a

270
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,000
third or distant you know it's not going

271
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,380
to be up there right it just is that's

272
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,620
the reality of it because because

273
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,420
software engineering teams are building

274
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,160
and deploying functionality as quickly

275
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,839
as possible

276
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,779
um the uh the security is is a bolt-on

277
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,399
at the end

278
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,980
so we understand why this is because the

279
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,000
business wants these features that

280
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
allows the business to build revenue and

281
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,300
new market streams and all those kind of

282
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,040
things they do but imagine if we

283
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,160
incentivized let's say bus drivers in

284
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,240
the same way that we incentivize

285
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,040
software Engineers if we set a bus

286
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,839
drivers hey the most important thing

287
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,040
about your job is to get from the

288
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,800
beginning of your route to the end of

289
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,700
your route

290
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,279
as quickly as possible

291
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,720
probably not going to work out very well

292
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,620
right

293
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,959
boom hyperbole

294
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,160
um the reality is that's what we're

295
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,360
doing with software engineering teams

296
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,860
right we say hey move as quickly as

297
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,260
possible and then we wonder why

298
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,060
you know sometimes the the applications

299
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,180
they deploy they build are not up to the

300
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,760
security kind of mandate that we want

301
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,019
so

302
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,339
that was software engineering teams

303
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,579
infosec infosec has not moved towards

304
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,620
the center like many of us did during

305
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,260
the devsecops revolution that's just a

306
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,660
reality right security is code in many

307
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,000
of these Concepts our Illusions are

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,160
often are Illusions they didn't really

309
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,180
happen

310
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,040
and that's a problem

311
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,860
infosec didn't evolve To Join the devops

312
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,019
Revolution and so guess what we're still

313
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,700
bolting Security on

314
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,260
10 15 20 years later

315
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,420
evidence of that problem is that

316
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,060
many infosec teams to this day I live in

317
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,720
Australia and I can't tell you like the

318
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,040
number of security questionnaires I've

319
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
gotten in the last year that when I look

320
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
at them I'm like oh my God I got this 20

321
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,420
I got the same security questionnaire 20

322
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,000
years ago right like it hasn't changed

323
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,220
who's got a security a questionnaire in

324
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,380
the last year

325
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,120
how much did you love it

326
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,860
you loved it right

327
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,380
it's an Antiquated ancient inefficient

328
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,399
system

329
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,920
and yeah infosec teams especially large

330
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,200
organizations continue to rely on this

331
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,540
ancient Antiquated mechanism

332
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,160
they're also still focused on the edge

333
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,779
and they haven't really kind of aligned

334
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,399
themselves with the cloud strategy I see

335
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,600
this all the time when I'm dealing with

336
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,220
customers in Australia less than the us

337
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,620
but definitely in Australia where

338
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,540
you talk to the you talk to the infosec

339
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,160
team about the data center and they've

340
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,480
got they've got controls they've got

341
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,100
intrusion detection and all the things

342
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,720
that you know we typically have but when

343
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,040
we talk about the cloud infrastructure

344
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,779
yeah we ain't got that it's like wait

345
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,160
hold on

346
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,839
for the data center you've got these

347
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,300
controls but for your Cloud VMS you

348
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,000
don't why not well because we didn't

349
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,139
really have the tooling and there's a

350
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,579
bunch of excuses and that's kind of

351
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:30,839
where we are

352
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,880
um the security tooling is often siled

353
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,220
right a security team will buy something

354
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,360
that's supposed to be for the

355
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,820
development teams but then they hold on

356
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,920
to it I'm precious

357
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,620
right my precious

358
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,480
um I was interviewing

359
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,399
um a customer during customer discovery

360
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,760
about a year ago and I said to him

361
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,220
um ah what what kind of security tools

362
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,680
are your engineers using typically day

363
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,660
to day like oh no we don't let them do

364
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,180
that oh why not well because we do that

365
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,220
in the CI CD pipeline oh okay cool so

366
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,060
what kind of stuff are you doing there

367
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,680
oh I don't really know why not because

368
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,660
that's owned by that other group right

369
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,060
and that's common and that's a problem

370
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,680
this stuff needs to be shared across

371
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,120
these these security tools and these

372
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,040
these Solutions and these processes need

373
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,519
to be shared across uh the organization

374
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,740
and because of this or maybe maybe this

375
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,660
is partly the problem is that

376
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,060
Enterprise organizations globally have

377
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,880
right sized infosec and so infosec kind

378
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,639
of has I mean they've my perspective is

379
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,620
that they are where they are because

380
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,420
they've been right sized down to

381
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,700
effectively an ineffective size

382
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,380
organization right Department that's

383
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,240
really what it comes down to

384
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,100
um but I see devsecops as an opportunity

385
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,380
to bring infosec into the fold to work

386
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,540
with them and do that in a truly

387
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,139
collaborative way

388
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,639
and finally operations

389
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,139
for cloud and startups operations teams

390
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,779
have been effectively devalued right

391
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,540
that's just the truth of it when I talk

392
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,639
to many scale-ups so we're talking about

393
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,600
100 to 200 you know head companies

394
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,519
um they effectively don't have an

395
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,500
operations team right they really don't

396
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,060
they certainly don't have one that

397
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,040
interacts with their Cloud team now they

398
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,139
might have a small Cloud Ops Team which

399
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,420
is effectively system sysadmin for for

400
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,360
the AWS or the Azure infrastructure

401
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,459
um but it's unfortunate

402
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,260
um that Ops has been devalued in the

403
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,740
modern world in the modern web app world

404
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,779
and that kind of leads to where we are

405
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,779
now so one way that we say to fix this

406
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,760
is deficit cops deficit Ops is going to

407
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,079
fix this

408
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,560
right but the reality is that like what

409
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,639
what is devsecops so the team what is it

410
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,019
um and there's a bunch of vendors that

411
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,300
will tell you what their version of

412
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,519
devsecops is Right which is often

413
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
a tiny little bit of testing in your CI

414
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,300
CD pipeline

415
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,560
and dubstep cops all right I'm good

416
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,579
um

417
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,740
you can't just change the name the name

418
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,180
of your team to the devsec Ops Team

419
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,000
which is what happened to me in in 2016

420
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,459
before they just changed the name of the

421
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,320
team right it's like we're good yeah

422
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,300
that's that's not it either

423
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,459
um the we really need to truly embed

424
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,199
those security and operations functions

425
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,600
within the software development process

426
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,240
I think pretty much we all kind of get

427
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,060
that right so let's go on from there

428
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,360
so what I wanted to build was this this

429
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,240
Nirvana

430
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,120
I wanted to build the A playbook that

431
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,740
could be used for any size organization

432
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,720
right whether they're a startup of 10

433
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,600
people a scale up of 200 people or an

434
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,019
Enterprise of 10 000 people now

435
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,880
also when we'll talk about this a little

436
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,139
bit later the way that those different

437
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,180
kinds of organizations work means that

438
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,920
the Playbook has to have a couple of

439
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,980
things in it that allows you to like it

440
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,380
makes it mailable right it makes it

441
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,199
um modifiable and so something I thought

442
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,600
about is that each of these things on

443
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,540
this Playbook should be

444
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,059
prioritized uh in other words like this

445
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,559
is something you should do first when

446
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,419
you're done with all those things go on

447
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,339
to the next set of things right and it

448
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,839
should also be sorted by difficulty

449
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,359
right so you understand what's my Roi

450
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,220
and implementing this particular task

451
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,559
and by the way throughout this I'm gonna

452
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,179
try as much as I can to refer to these

453
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,359
as tasks not as controlled because I

454
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,400
don't see them as controlled

455
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,620
my personal requirements is that I

456
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,140
needed a simple checklist right

457
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,059
if I'm in a small startup here's the

458
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,200
things that I can do if I'm an

459
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,179
Enterprise here's the things I can do I

460
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,100
wanted to focus heavily on devsecops and

461
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,039
collaboration and I wanted to build in

462
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,780
compliance requirements

463
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,160
because I didn't want to deal with those

464
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,620
stupid questionnaires anymore right I

465
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,760
just wanted to get rid of that I wanted

466
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,419
to have I wanted when infosep came to

467
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,820
the to the team I wanted the question

468
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,679
they were going to about to ask to

469
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,539
already be answered I wanted you to have

470
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,620
someplace you could go and already

471
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,240
answer that

472
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,700
um and I also wanted to build a way to

473
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,760
pull those teams into this mindset this

474
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,520
devsec Ops mindset so I wrote it

475
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,080
specifically in a way that could be

476
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,419
approachable by people that had a

477
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,940
traditional infosec or system of admin

478
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,120
kind of operations background

479
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,039
um my requirements there's so many

480
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,200
requirements I I made two of them

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,179
um how do I bring the infosec teams into

482
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,880
this but also how do I make appsec a

483
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,100
first-class citizen inside of infosec

484
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,240
and this is something I'm going to touch

485
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,440
on a little bit later but I want to

486
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,080
mention it now appsec often is not

487
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,780
really fully brought into the infosec

488
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,400
teams at least in the Enterprise world

489
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,620
right sometimes they're owned by

490
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,000
engineering groups and sometimes they're

491
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,200
owned by infosec but they always seem to

492
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,820
be kind of their own thing

493
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,980
um and that's I see that as a problem I

494
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,240
want to bring that I want to bring the

495
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,000
app set capability into the fold

496
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,980
um I've already said I wanted to address

497
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,080
those security questionnaires I also

498
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,820
want to increase CI CD and automation

499
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,500
maturity because the reality is that

500
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,059
when I talk to customers like oh yeah we

501
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,280
got cicd pipelines we got all that and

502
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,440
when you look into it

503
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,780
the the maturity of those pipelines is

504
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,260
often greatly overestimated or

505
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,460
exaggerated in some cases

506
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,080
um so let's talk for a second about a

507
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,700
questionnaire this is actually a

508
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,220
questionnaire from an organization that

509
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,220
was bringing me in to actually do many

510
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,419
of the things that they were asking me

511
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,539
here if I did right so for example what

512
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,039
secure coding framework do you reference

513
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,179
When developing software they had

514
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,860
literally brought me in to help them

515
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,440
build that right and it just shows you

516
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,179
what kind of a ridiculous thing these

517
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,039
questionnaires are you're asking for a

518
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,419
vendor to do things that you yourself

519
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,240
don't do right but at the same time it's

520
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,340
part of our process so how do we build

521
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,020
in the ability to interact with that

522
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,840
into something like the devsecops

523
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,179
Playbook

524
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,039
um oh and um

525
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,620
I I kind of compiled all the

526
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,880
questionnaires that I've gotten over the

527
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,100
last several years and kind of figured

528
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,720
out the standard questions they asked

529
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,120
but then I went step further I actually

530
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,740
reached out to

531
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,240
um we have some Partners in cyber

532
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,700
insurance and Brokers and I asked them

533
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,960
hey can you send me all the

534
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,940
questionnaires for all the Cyber

535
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,400
insurance companies right so when you're

536
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,539
signing up from all the things they ask

537
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,500
you

538
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,240
and so I've got 10 or 12 of these things

539
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,799
and I did the same thing there I kind of

540
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,080
collated all them back together and then

541
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,700
what I had is I had this list of about

542
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,059
50 so 50 something things that are the

543
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,039
most typical questions right are you

544
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,039
running anti-virus or EDR right you know

545
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,500
if it says are you running antivirus you

546
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,700
know they haven't updated this security

547
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,400
questionnaire in about 10 years right

548
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,980
um are you using MFA which is hilarious

549
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,080
because many large organizations to this

550
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
day still aren't using MFA but it's a

551
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,799
typical typical kind of stuff and so

552
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,020
this list of 50 things 50 requirements

553
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,760
were things that I had in my mind right

554
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,400
I wanted to address

555
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,059
um the uh and specifically around uh

556
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,460
just to drill into a little bit more

557
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,780
specifically questions on the

558
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,640
questionnaires that had to do with the

559
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,559
software development life cycle right or

560
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,559
the end-to-end application environment

561
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,179
so

562
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,559
here's some

563
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,940
um here's some documents and

564
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,820
organizations that I've drawn

565
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,039
inspiration from right

566
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,480
um is everybody familiar with the

567
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,700
minimal viable secure product

568
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,220
all right this came out about a year and

569
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,299
a half ago

570
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,679
um it's a I'm actually on the working

571
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,980
group for this um the mvsp in the

572
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,940
website is mvsp.dev it's a great

573
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,860
um document It's relatively

574
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,299
straightforward and simple and basically

575
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,539
what the mvsp does is it says this is a

576
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,360
baseline that you can use as an I.T

577
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,580
person to enter to know that the person

578
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,900
you're about to buy something from or

579
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,720
interact with has done what's minimally

580
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,799
viable

581
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,140
to be acceptable at a security level

582
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,460
right

583
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,120
um the ssdf I'm sure most you probably

584
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,720
have heard about the ssdf the ssdf is a

585
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,480
large and sprawling document

586
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,980
um and

587
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,159
I I have mad respect for it but it also

588
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,380
isn't a contrary to the name it's not

589
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,880
actually the kind of document that

590
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,559
engineering teams or actual foot

591
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,720
soldiers can

592
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,020
kind of comprehend and deal with right

593
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,880
the SVS is one of the best ones out

594
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,440
there um and that's I'm not just saying

595
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,880
that because I'm at a watch conference

596
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,919
and I have to drink the Kool-Aid but the

597
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,460
reality is asvs is a very prescriptive

598
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,620
um and uh

599
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,120
large

600
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,179
um and and uh accept uh accessible

601
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,620
document

602
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,140
um and I only recently kind of

603
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,900
uh became aware of the asvs within the

604
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,419
last year so actually it predates my my

605
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,179
uh introduction to asbs predates when I

606
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,799
wrote the the first version of The

607
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,840
Playbook but then there's also Teemo

608
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,440
pagel's um devsecops maturity model the

609
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,539
dsom which is a great document and I was

610
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,980
aware of that when I wrote The Playbook

611
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,500
and the dsam is cool and it's got like

612
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,059
multiple maturity levels inside of it

613
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,340
three of them but

614
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,159
it's also written in language that's

615
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,320
I think supposed to be more approachable

616
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,539
by managers rather than foot soldiers

617
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,400
the people the day-to-day people oh and

618
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,860
something I forgot to say is I'm a doer

619
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,960
right I'm a CEO of a company but I'm a

620
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,299
doer I still write code I still do a lot

621
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,280
of the QA in my organization maybe

622
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,320
that's because I like to to get too

623
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,880
involved in those things but the reality

624
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,559
is that's what I really enjoy and so

625
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,059
when I built this Playbook I wrote it

626
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,620
for a specific audience and that

627
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,780
specific audience is people that do

628
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,880
technical things the audience for this

629
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,159
is Engineers it's a very prescriptive

630
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,480
document

631
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,080
um

632
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,679
so all of those and several others that

633
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:47,880
I didn't have time to put in the slide

634
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,460
act as inspiration but the reason I

635
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,080
wrote my own document is because none of

636
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,240
those actually gave me kind of

637
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,559
what I was looking for

638
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,260
so before we talk about

639
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,460
devsecops let's talk for a second about

640
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,799
application security because after all

641
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,620
we're at an owasp conference right

642
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,740
open web application security

643
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,860
project yeah I was feeling Pete

644
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,659
why is why do we want to talk about

645
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,520
application security because

646
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,740
frankly I didn't want to write an appsec

647
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,240
document what I'm trying to do is is

648
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,460
different I'm trying to build a Playbook

649
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,559
that will help or a document that'll

650
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,440
help organizations build across

651
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,919
departmental devsecops methodology but

652
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,659
to understand how to do that you kind of

653
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:34,380
have to understand the difference

654
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,840
between appsec and

655
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,820
um

656
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,360
devsecops

657
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,179
now this this definition here this is

658
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,880
mine that's kind of me stealing two or

659
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,100
three other people's definitions but I

660
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,240
think what's important about application

661
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,799
security is that it's typically actually

662
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,120
a role it's actually something that

663
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,460
people do right their job is to provide

664
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,220
application security uh

665
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,760
um tasks for an organization

666
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,900
it's the process of adding and

667
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,600
developing and testing security features

668
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,940
throughout the application development

669
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,380
process

670
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,900
um uh you know to prevent threats and

671
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,020
vulnerabilities but it's important to to

672
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,020
concentrate on the fact that

673
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,940
um it's different than devsecops because

674
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,100
devsecops is a process it's like a

675
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,260
methodology it's not a team whereas an

676
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,179
app set typically is thought of appsec

677
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,100
is typically thought of as a team by the

678
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,320
way this is my interpretation you guys

679
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,360
can disagree because guess what we all

680
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,700
get to have our own opinions right it's

681
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,860
kind of like armpits and hair we all get

682
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,940
our own

683
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,100
um abstract teams tend to be staffed

684
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,740
primarily by people that started out as

685
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,020
software engineers

686
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,360
you know that's kind of the standard

687
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
um they typically have not come from a

688
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,640
secops or system admin uh background but

689
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,320
that's not always the case

690
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,000
um they concentrate on on specifically

691
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
the software testing and secure coding

692
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
practices super important

693
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,220
um they concentrate more on the

694
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,080
application itself and testing that

695
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,460
application than they do on the

696
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,520
application environment

697
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,440
and the tools they use the scope I mean

698
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,820
this is different for every organization

699
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,200
but the reality is that most of the time

700
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,520
it involves

701
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,580
the kind of immediate tools and and

702
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,500
solutions and platforms the software

703
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,480
engineering teams are using

704
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,240
um yeah and the tooling tends to be FCA

705
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,059
software composition analysis static

706
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,820
analysis and dynamic and sometimes

707
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,500
Dynamic application testing uh

708
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,419
you you guys get to choose your own

709
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,279
definition of appsec this is you know

710
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,799
this is not Paul's way or the is the

711
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,020
only way but that's after many years

712
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,880
working with appsec teams that's my my

713
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,740
feeling of how to describe them all

714
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,679
watch does have an amazing document I

715
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,120
only came across this about nine months

716
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,760
ago has an amazing document about how to

717
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,720
build an appsec program

718
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,240
um so if any of you are interested I

719
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,400
highly recommend checking that out it's

720
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,900
really cool it kind of breaks breaks

721
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,520
it's similar to a document that I've got

722
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
in my head floating around right now

723
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,940
about how I break down

724
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,539
um

725
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,299
helping organizations like build out

726
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,299
devsecops based on the Playbook

727
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,539
so I highly recommend checking out that

728
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,159
doc

729
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,900
all right so what is devsec OPS we

730
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,580
talked a little bit about appsec what is

731
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,658
what is devsecops

732
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,559
it automates the integration of security

733
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,980
at every phase of the sdlc

734
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,659
um and I really I should really replace

735
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,640
the sdlc software development lifecycle

736
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,020
which is the application environment

737
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,380
right from initial design

738
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,480
all the way through integration testing

739
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,960
deployment and the monitoring of of that

740
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,640
which is typically monitoring of things

741
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,520
like at the far right of the uh of the

742
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,640
life cycle tend not to be inside of the

743
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,919
the kind of appsec

744
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,559
um world

745
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,000
devsecops is it important

746
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,980
of developers security and operations

747
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,240
teams

748
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,159
um and that's exactly what it should be

749
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,840
so I'm going to take a second here to be

750
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,159
a little bit

751
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,299
um uh not combative but challenging

752
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:13,980
devsecops is not the vendors don't get

753
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,380
to Define it right Gartner sorry if

754
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,760
anybody's works for Gardner here but

755
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,980
Garner doesn't get to Define devsecops

756
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,980
your organization does right the reality

757
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,779
is that it really started out as a

758
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,640
collaboration it was supposed to be a

759
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,559
collaboration like devops was and

760
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,140
unfortunately it's been co-opted to mean

761
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,900
buzzwords right a little bit of CI CD

762
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,340
stuff

763
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,580
was bang and we're good at just the cops

764
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,140
so I want us to concentrate on the fact

765
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,460
that it's really about collaborating

766
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,480
with those organizations because

767
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,799
ultimately at the end of this the

768
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,059
business value that we get out of

769
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,059
devsecops is a better more functioning

770
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,919
and secure application and application

771
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,600
environment which is good for all of us

772
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,340
right

773
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,480
so

774
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,059
some of the devsecops Primitives it

775
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,299
includes team members with more differs

776
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:02,100
backgrounds that's the first thing

777
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,340
when I got to build a we didn't call it

778
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,620
devsecops by the way we call it the

779
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,320
platform team right that was platform

780
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,400
team that would have been what I look

781
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,380
that was kind of popular between 2012

782
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,279
and 2015 somewhere in there the platform

783
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,020
team at Blue Cross Blue Shield included

784
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,059
people multiple people from QA

785
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,220
it included people from the security

786
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,360
teams

787
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,159
and included people from the middleware

788
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,440
teams

789
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,200
and several others and so I've actually

790
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,320
gotten to see it work as a truly

791
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,059
collaborative thing and it changed the

792
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,200
way that we built and deployed

793
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,600
applications at that organization so

794
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,539
I've seen it work the perspective the

795
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,700
concentration is really on in testing

796
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,620
and deployment across the whole of the

797
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,299
application environment so it's not just

798
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:51,000
about testing the application code and

799
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,860
the way that you you know you test that

800
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,080
before it gets deployed it's about that

801
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,559
whole end-to-end process

802
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,899
um uh and a lot more concentration on

803
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,520
deployment and how things actually run

804
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,039
in the run time and whatnot the scope

805
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,559
for devsecops is that it focuses on that

806
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,260
whole sdlc rather than the far left now

807
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,059
I'm sure we've all heard shift left

808
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,100
right has anybody not no nobody's nugget

809
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,240
nobody's going to answer this right has

810
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,000
anybody not heard about shift left

811
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,220
funny guy uh

812
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,380
I it's I believe shifting left is super

813
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,600
important like it is it's super

814
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,860
important but we need to be shifting

815
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,600
everywhere right and that's what

816
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,460
collaboration with those teams and

817
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,899
finding those Champions finding those

818
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,460
people to connect with that's what that

819
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,140
allows us to do

820
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,059
um and the tools that typically are used

821
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,919
for CSE and again this every

822
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,299
organization gets to Define this

823
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,480
themselves but tends to be CI CD and

824
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,679
deployment focused

825
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,000
um and the security tool is a more

826
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,159
broadly based right infrastructure is

827
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,919
code scanning tools and and other things

828
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,600
that aren't typically going to be part

829
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,299
of an appsec process

830
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,960
um and this this word right here

831
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,520
that word needs to have more love right

832
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,080
monitoring of the applications

833
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,940
we need to spend more time doing that

834
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,039
because you don't really know what the

835
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,440
Baseline is with a normal operating you

836
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,240
know uh perspective an application is

837
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,159
until you monitor it and I feel like in

838
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,260
today's highly iterative space we don't

839
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,240
spend enough time thinking about the

840
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,370
monitoring of our applications

841
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:20,580
[Music]

842
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
um

843
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,039
so what's important about Dev stock Ops

844
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,779
is the outcome

845
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,480
the outcomes that I'm looking for are

846
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,580
that the team members

847
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,860
who will be become something will

848
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,720
already be subject matter experts in

849
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,980
some portion of the application

850
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,020
environment but

851
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,840
as as being part of this this devsecop's

852
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,760
kind of mindset they will understand

853
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,000
other aspart aspects of that environment

854
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,460
and be able to perform some of those

855
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,559
functions that's super important we'll

856
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,760
be able to perform some of those

857
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,500
functions one of the things that made

858
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,320
the devset the devops transformation for

859
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,179
me so powerful is I started acting like

860
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:06,480
uh security and uh developers what do I

861
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,220
mean by that well I started doing things

862
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,260
like checking all my scripts into

863
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,960
Version Control right versioning them

864
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,880
sharing those and interacting it wasn't

865
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,419
just Paul's repo it was the teams repo

866
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,059
right I actually got involved with how

867
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,640
do you deploy and manage the security

868
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,320
tools up until that point that was not

869
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,880
my thing that was somebody else's thing

870
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,679
remember that picture from the 90s where

871
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,419
somebody's throwing a javelin over the

872
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:31,980
wall and then somebody on the other side

873
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,720
of the wall you remember that we all I

874
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,899
had that on my on my cubicle wall

875
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:37,620
um

876
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,220
as I as I started to work with those

877
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,840
teams and one of the ways that I did

878
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,419
that is that my my boss came and tapped

879
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,279
me on the shoulder in 2001 and said hey

880
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,899
do you want to go work with the security

881
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,299
team for six months I'm a Unix admin I'm

882
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:53,520
like I had a background in in some

883
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,960
security firewall stuff as I mentioned

884
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,179
earlier and I said yeah sure so I went

885
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,340
and actually worked this is 2001. I

886
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,679
worked with the security in a and also

887
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,539
in the knock too as well and that

888
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:04,860
changed my career it changed my

889
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,200
trajectory and it made me more Broad and

890
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,080
diverse across that um set of functional

891
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,880
requirements and I think that's

892
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,039
ultimately what I want to get out of

893
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,539
this so

894
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,399
um a reminder I'm trying to help my

895
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,980
teams work more collaborative I'm not

896
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,840
trying to build an appsec team so this

897
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,220
is not I'm not trying to make an

898
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,720
argument abstract versus devsecops

899
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,500
that's not what I'm trying to do I'm

900
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,820
just trying to say what I'm trying to do

901
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,779
here is I'm trying to create a more

902
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,279
collaborative environment

903
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,080
all right how do you start a devsecops

904
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,580
program

905
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,080
there's a lot of words up here so I

906
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,799
apologize I will paraphrase

907
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,240
effectively what I suggest and I've got

908
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,799
a whole process that I that I helped

909
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,659
when I was Contracting and Consulting I

910
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:43,860
did this for people and I still do this

911
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,380
for for companies with secure stack on

912
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,940
occasion but

913
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,559
um I spend a month or two kind of

914
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,740
identifying all the applications right I

915
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,200
identify who owns those applications I

916
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,519
map those applications to different

917
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,440
people and teams

918
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,720
um uh to production and what have you

919
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,519
and once you kind of build that mapping

920
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,399
you quickly figure out because what

921
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:06,419
you're doing is when you're building out

922
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,799
that map mapping you're calling up

923
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,199
somebody say Hey Arthur like what are

924
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,639
the applications that you interact with

925
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,159
on a weekly basis bing bing bing bing

926
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,599
what are the applications you work with

927
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,639
on like a quarterly basis ah big and

928
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,139
Bing you begin to build this mapping

929
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,940
Arthur knows about these Paul knows

930
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,219
about these once you figure that out as

931
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,599
part of that process you've probably

932
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,980
figured out who some of the Champions

933
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,480
are you can reach out to right and it's

934
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,580
really important to early on figure out

935
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,040
who those natural Champions are and for

936
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,839
at Blue Cross Blue Shield I was one of

937
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,460
those Champions because I was genuinely

938
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,139
interested in working with the infosec

939
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,099
teams

940
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,619
um uh figure out who the doers are

941
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,480
because life is built into two types of

942
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,300
people doers and not doers figure out

943
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,280
who the doers are and then bring them

944
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,659
into the fold

945
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,060
um prioritize make it a priority of your

946
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,918
company find a way to evangelize that

947
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,859
and align that with business value in

948
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,060
Australia that's really easy right now

949
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,800
because all of Australia is freaking out

950
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,560
about the Optus and medibank hacks who's

951
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,480
see this is cool man I see some nodding

952
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,640
here this is crazy that a tiny little

953
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,619
country like Australia our big hack

954
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,560
which by the way affects about 40 of our

955
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,520
population 40 right one Telco it's our

956
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,380
number two Telco too if it had been

957
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,060
Telstra Telstra which is their number

958
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,940
one would be even more but then recently

959
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,099
medibank which is our largest private

960
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,619
insurer in Australia was also hacked and

961
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:26,599
literally

962
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,599
every single customer record of theirs

963
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,760
almost four million people

964
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,880
uh they were in there for months they

965
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,099
were in there so long at medibank they

966
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,859
built up this really cool tool to to

967
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,839
pull stuff out of the database break it

968
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,099
did anybody else read about this to

969
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,599
break it up into chunks and oh my God

970
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,700
like they were in there so long they got

971
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,700
to optimize you know when the bad guys

972
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,500
you know when the bad guys in your

973
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,000
network too long then they got a chance

974
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,040
to optimize right

975
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,960
um do my Eddie Murphy again

976
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,200
um but in Australia right now it's

977
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,660
really easy for me to evangelize

978
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,000
devsecops because right now a bunch of

979
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,200
people have like my mother-in-law she's

980
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,220
freaking out she's got to get a new

981
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,480
passport she's gotta get a new driver's

982
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,099
license

983
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,599
oh this is like okay those processes

984
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,800
they're gonna you know you don't have to

985
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,880
pay for it now they're gonna do it for

986
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,839
you

987
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,060
um but 40 of Australia is is in the same

988
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,380
boat and so it's easy for me to

989
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,180
evangelize that stuff

990
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,180
so figure out who are the relevant teams

991
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,800
you need to collaborate with

992
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,260
and start to build those relationships

993
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,400
with them right and I know this is all

994
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,619
that high flute and stuff we all kind of

995
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,000
know this at some level but the reality

996
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,040
is that building those networking

997
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,480
opportunities

998
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,800
um is really important but then also

999
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,200
building collateral to give them to

1000
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,460
interact with them is super important

1001
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,079
one of the things that I did when I was

1002
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,400
a Blue Cross Blue Shield is I started

1003
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,980
building out templates and VMware to

1004
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,260
make the uh the infosec team's job

1005
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,780
easier and just by that reaching out to

1006
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,400
them and saying hey what are the things

1007
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,839
that you need to embed in the average

1008
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,540
windows or Linux image was a way for me

1009
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,640
to create that relationship right and by

1010
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,500
creating that template for them I

1011
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,119
created collateral that they could then

1012
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,440
use they could build documentation

1013
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,480
around that right but it required that I

1014
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,740
reach out to them

1015
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,599
um and that's that's part of the if you

1016
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,460
wanted this to be successful we have to

1017
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,940
do and finally quantify how what what

1018
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,040
success looks like right

1019
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,800
and to me I've found ways with my team

1020
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,119
because I'm doing this right now I found

1021
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,460
ways to say hey if you do these certain

1022
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,839
functions if you hit these and it's not

1023
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,940
like if you if you hit 80 of this that's

1024
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,740
not the way to do it if you say hey if

1025
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,599
all of our applications are deployed in

1026
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,820
a prod with MFA working and these other

1027
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,260
things working

1028
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,300
you know here's a kpi right we don't

1029
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,119
call it a kpi a secure stack right but

1030
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,460
choose kpis that don't suck right I

1031
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,260
think that's the important thing

1032
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,000
um all right so when I was thinking

1033
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,040
about this document I'm like oh man

1034
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,720
well how do I build this document I'm

1035
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,400
thinking about it I took the famous this

1036
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
is this is my art right I took the

1037
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,320
famous Infinity logo who everybody's

1038
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,540
seen the famous devsecops devops

1039
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,160
Infinity logo right and I started

1040
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,240
mapping out the kind of Enterprise grade

1041
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,040
tasks and I quickly ran out of space I

1042
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,440
was like what do I do what do I do do I

1043
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,079
do I make a second ring around there how

1044
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,820
do I do this there's a lot of things

1045
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,520
so then I said now let me lay it out let

1046
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,800
me lay out the devsecops kind of life

1047
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,820
cycle in a linear line and let me start

1048
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,940
to layer the tasks in there right and

1049
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,560
this is the first iteration of what I

1050
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,420
came up with and basically this is

1051
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,160
broken down into

1052
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,859
tasks that are owned by Developers

1053
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,440
tasks that are owned by operations and

1054
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,780
tasks they're owned by infosec

1055
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,599
but as as part of doing that I'm

1056
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,640
effectively underscoring the fact that

1057
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,260
these should be different groups with

1058
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,240
different ownership right

1059
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,839
um

1060
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,760
so one way that I kind of thought like

1061
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,119
how do I make how do I make these tasks

1062
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,520
um how do I how do I effect for the or

1063
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,040
adjust for the fact that

1064
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,079
um uh different people from different

1065
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,240
teams will sometimes do those so I added

1066
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,000
this security domain so basically what

1067
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,740
this says is that

1068
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,720
people that kind of do development type

1069
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,540
stuff will own the green stuff right and

1070
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,640
uh people that kind of own the cloud

1071
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,260
apps and operations will do the kind of

1072
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,940
orange stuff see how big that is it's

1073
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,220
really big right very expansive very

1074
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,900
Broad and people that own the kind of

1075
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,119
security stuff will do this stuff and I

1076
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,260
forgot to put anything in that column

1077
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,280
but that's okay

1078
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,560
it's it's a work in progress

1079
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,460
um

1080
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,900
and I realized when I came up with this

1081
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,940
whatever number this is this is like 30

1082
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,859
or whatever whatever number of tasks

1083
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,720
this is I thought there's still a lot

1084
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,400
here my my page I'm gonna have to change

1085
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,859
the aspect ratio to be to not be

1086
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,119
landscape I'll have to go to portrait

1087
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,320
mode

1088
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,520
um and I thought well that's that's

1089
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,560
that's not cool

1090
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,480
um but then the other problem was when I

1091
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,380
took

1092
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,940
when I took

1093
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,680
the first version of devsecott's

1094
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,119
Playbook to some of my startup customers

1095
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,700
like we don't have any security people

1096
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,180
I thought Oh I thought

1097
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,940
I didn't I didn't I mean I knew that but

1098
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,280
I didn't do account for it right why did

1099
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,359
I put all that stuff there that they

1100
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,280
don't have anybody to do right and it

1101
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,440
got me thinking that's why I realized

1102
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,180
that this needs to be mailable this

1103
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,640
needs to be uh flexible enough for any

1104
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,440
size organization any type of

1105
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,900
organization to do

1106
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,700
um to implement

1107
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,480
um so one size does not fit all so I

1108
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,500
thought about this and I thought well

1109
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,859
let me just create a document that has a

1110
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,680
set of domains

1111
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,480
um oh yeah real quick what's different

1112
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,760
from for startups versus Enterprise

1113
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,220
obviously startups have a different size

1114
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,359
team

1115
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,060
um they intend not to have subject

1116
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,520
matter experts in in security or

1117
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,079
operations

1118
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,400
um not always the case but often that's

1119
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,660
the case especially with the smaller

1120
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,180
ones uh they're definitely driven by

1121
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,820
developers most of the startups that I

1122
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,140
work with

1123
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,740
um unlike who who here Works in and who

1124
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,380
who who here identifies or says they

1125
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,260
work in an Enterprise organization

1126
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,380
okay maybe maybe a third a quarter

1127
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,040
um

1128
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,260
can a developer deploy something

1129
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,619
directly to prod in your environment

1130
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,740
we got we got yes we got some no's if if

1131
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,660
the answer is yes the answer is yes hold

1132
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,820
up your hand if they can

1133
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,859
okay I'm not a bad guy so you can be you

1134
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,060
can be honest

1135
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,800
um

1136
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,500
with startups typically software

1137
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,200
Engineers can deploy anything and that

1138
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,520
means there's a lot of sprawl because

1139
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,960
they're deploying development

1140
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,880
environments and whatnot

1141
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,220
um but you have to account for that

1142
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,500
um so and the reality is that when

1143
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,640
they're deploying to the cloud there's

1144
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
often not a lot of real understanding

1145
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,599
about infrastructure right there's not a

1146
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,520
lot of experience there so maybe that

1147
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,380
maybe we can use the devsecops Playbook

1148
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,380
as a a way to address that so let's

1149
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,180
break the let's break it down into

1150
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,980
instead of like

1151
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,359
you know plan uh write test build deploy

1152
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,040
all those kind of very

1153
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,260
formulated things let's break it down

1154
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,020
instead into domains of ownership let's

1155
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,940
add that prioritization system that I

1156
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,980
talk about what you should do first

1157
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,520
right what are the and also what are the

1158
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,720
hardest things to do and how do you

1159
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,700
define that Roi around it let's build

1160
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,220
that into as well

1161
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,319
so let's show the bloody repo Paul

1162
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,940
so all this is

1163
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,940
this is GitHub repo

1164
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,020
and you can go to

1165
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,000
GitHub

1166
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,099
oh boy I'm gonna pull this over here

1167
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,000
come on

1168
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,839
breaking my neck

1169
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,300
there you go oh yeah

1170
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,720
Echo here it is

1171
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,240
um this is version 1.2 of the document

1172
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,839
um

1173
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,220
uh

1174
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,859
I've worked with about eight people so

1175
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,920
far to to build this this document out

1176
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,200
um uh and a couple of those people in

1177
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,460
particular have been really really

1178
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,440
important to me a guy named Cole

1179
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,900
cornford if uh we're videoing this right

1180
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,660
hey Cole it's a shout out to you buddy

1181
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,640
um uh

1182
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,200
uh those people kind of like you know

1183
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,480
been my my test

1184
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,740
um as I've written this because I I

1185
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,060
wrote the first version of it entirely

1186
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,380
by myself and then gave it to my friends

1187
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,480
and then got a bunch of uh responses

1188
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,619
back

1189
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,960
um but ultimately The Playbook is broken

1190
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,980
down as I said into

1191
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,619
these domains right here and those

1192
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,160
domains

1193
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,680
are the development environment

1194
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,480
source code management

1195
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,760
continuous Improvement in automation

1196
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,319
deployment

1197
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,540
and I don't like this so I need some

1198
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,980
help with what to call us organizational

1199
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,980
techniques I hate the word techniques so

1200
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,140
uh I'm crowdsourcing a better way to

1201
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,579
define that so if you've got any ideas

1202
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,680
please come and hit me I'll be out on

1203
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,839
the Expo floor but there's also an

1204
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,780
addendum for compliance right

1205
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,300
um and

1206
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,920
what that looks like there's there's my

1207
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,000
image there

1208
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,880
each one of those uh sections is broken

1209
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,000
down into anywhere between 8 and 20

1210
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,880
different tasks so if we look here in

1211
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,339
the development environment

1212
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,619
list domain excuse me you can see

1213
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,260
something like secure code training

1214
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,599
um using git ignores using pre-commit

1215
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:37,700
hook

1216
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,099
scans you can see a description right

1217
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:41,880
here

1218
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,619
pre-commit hook for security scans

1219
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,300
provides timely feedback to engineers

1220
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,400
and helps to prevent vulnerable code for

1221
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,920
being being introduced to a repository

1222
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,000
uh this column right here this excuse me

1223
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,859
describes the priority

1224
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,380
so something that's a priority one is

1225
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,359
something you should do right away so

1226
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,400
anything that's in column but sorry this

1227
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,680
Priority One go through if you wanna if

1228
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,060
you wanna you know start to implement

1229
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,380
some of these things go through the

1230
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,140
devsecops Playbook excuse me

1231
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,599
implement the things that are number one

1232
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,880
um and then Circle back when you've all

1233
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,079
done all those and start doing the

1234
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,760
things that are number twos and then

1235
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,839
when you're done with those come back

1236
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,520
and circle back to the number threes

1237
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,440
there's only one two and threes

1238
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,480
um also here's that column for how

1239
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,400
difficult something most of these things

1240
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,800
are easy secure code trading that's a

1241
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,300
little bit more difficult that that

1242
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,859
involves people

1243
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,780
um teams and whatnot

1244
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,220
but something else that's important

1245
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,260
because I always wanted to have a

1246
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,540
compliance mechanism here is that we're

1247
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,480
addressing in this final column the

1248
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,460
specific

1249
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,980
Frameworks that that particular task

1250
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,900
because it's not a control this is a

1251
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,920
task

1252
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,599
Maps too

1253
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,700
um and me and my team and and the group

1254
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,380
of collaborators that have been working

1255
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,819
on this

1256
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,619
um have been working on that and and

1257
00:45:58,619 --> 00:45:59,940
we're working on the next version of

1258
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,099
this which won't just list out cisa

1259
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,619
it'll list out the specific thing that

1260
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,599
it maps to right so that is coming

1261
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,800
actually most of that work is done

1262
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,000
already

1263
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,440
um we're also thinking about

1264
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,819
implementing I'm jumping ahead to the

1265
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,140
next slide but we're also thinking about

1266
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,440
implementing a um a second document a

1267
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,420
second markup document that talks about

1268
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,280
each one of these things in more depth

1269
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,079
and gives links and video links and

1270
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,579
stuff like that

1271
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,400
um but as I scroll down here you'll see

1272
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,079
that

1273
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,119
so what would your loans for difficulty

1274
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:30,900
again

1275
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,119
the lens were difficulty good question

1276
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:33,960
um

1277
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,940
it was based on my lens so first and

1278
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,020
foremost so one of the things that's

1279
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,819
great about this is that you can you can

1280
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,319
Fork it and you can change it for your

1281
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,420
lens but ultimately difficulty was about

1282
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,000
how long and how many people it took to

1283
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,359
implement that thing that task

1284
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:49,980
um and that's based on my experience

1285
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,480
again

1286
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,800
um you know that's going to probably

1287
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,480
differ for other people but the reality

1288
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,640
is something like for example

1289
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,859
um local static code analysis now the

1290
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,660
reason that I call this out is local is

1291
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,740
because

1292
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,319
I believe that static code analysis and

1293
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,420
and some of these you know scanning

1294
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,980
Technologies should be used at different

1295
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,859
places I believe it should be used on as

1296
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:12,359
many developer laptops as possible

1297
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:14,400
especially static analysis static

1298
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,020
analysis in particular is not well

1299
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,599
suited for CI CD pipelines does anybody

1300
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,260
disagree with that

1301
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,900
did we get a real disagreement yeah yeah

1302
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,900
rather fair enough

1303
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,180
I think they should too and actually an

1304
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,980
addendum to what I said is I think that

1305
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,119
you should absolutely run static

1306
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,060
analysis with specific rule sets right

1307
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,980
that are the problem with static

1308
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,200
analysis inside of CI CD is a lot of the

1309
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,140
outcome output is not Boolean like do

1310
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,940
you break that do you stop that build or

1311
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,400
not right how am I doing for time good

1312
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,520
five more minutes

1313
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,660
10th week

1314
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,599
um uh so

1315
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:57,240
um the reason I call that easy is

1316
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,520
because it's pretty easy to go Blue

1317
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,460
install

1318
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,500
right and then you run some grub right

1319
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,319
that's pretty easy and it involves one

1320
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,420
person to your question right

1321
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,920
now

1322
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,900
if everybody on the team doesn't do that

1323
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,440
well okay but at least some people have

1324
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,119
done that right and you're getting value

1325
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,099
out of even some or even one person

1326
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,500
doing that right so that's how the lens

1327
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,060
for for

1328
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,619
um difficulty works for me does that

1329
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,720
make sense yes cool

1330
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,579
um

1331
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:31,440
the uh the mappings here you might

1332
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,940
notice a couple here that are not

1333
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,240
familiar to you apra is a it's an

1334
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,680
Australian

1335
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,599
um uh framework compliance framework

1336
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,140
that applies to organizations

1337
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,420
um that fall under the kind of financial

1338
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,520
services uh you kind of think about it

1339
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,619
like as kind of the SEC in a way sort of

1340
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:50,460
but

1341
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,500
um and also to

1342
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,140
um I don't think is there one there the

1343
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,940
also the ism

1344
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,619
we're not we're not a very creative

1345
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,240
people in Australia so we name things

1346
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,240
really kind of the ism stands for the

1347
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,480
information security manual a very sexy

1348
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,740
name I know

1349
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,420
um but it's actually a really great

1350
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,640
document it's written by the Australian

1351
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,800
signals directorate which is our version

1352
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,839
of the CIA in Australia

1353
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,660
um and it's actually what was that

1354
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:22,560
uh sorry NSA did I say CIA NSA okay

1355
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,819
thank you

1356
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:24,420
um

1357
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,220
and the ism has actually got a maturity

1358
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,300
model into it's one of the first

1359
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,680
documents in the world to introduce a

1360
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,180
maturity model it's it's a very

1361
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,099
prescriptive well

1362
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,020
some parts of it are prescriptive some

1363
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,640
parts have been not so much but it's a

1364
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,960
large document they've broken it down

1365
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,180
into guidelines like for example a

1366
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,500
couple years ago they came out with a

1367
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,960
secure coding guidelines which is a

1368
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,819
subset of the ism but anyhow that's why

1369
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:45,960
you might notice a few in there

1370
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,220
otherwise you should know you should

1371
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,339
recognize them as CIS and nist 800 ssdf

1372
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,440
and so on and so forth we're also

1373
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,200
working on putting asvs and some others

1374
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,880
in there as well but if I scroll down to

1375
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,260
the next section

1376
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,380
CI CD pipelines and automation right

1377
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,819
the reason I broke it out into these

1378
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:04,319
domains is because

1379
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,359
that doesn't necessarily map your

1380
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,460
organization might not let the

1381
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,140
engineering teams run that I don't know

1382
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,579
maybe they do maybe they don't but the

1383
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,740
point is that that's up to you guys so

1384
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,680
if I don't stick to that formulaic you

1385
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,079
know eight stage

1386
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,700
devsecops model sorry lifecycle model

1387
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,800
you can adapt this any way you want to

1388
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,500
but as you move into these these

1389
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,180
different tasks

1390
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,099
they begin let me go all the way down to

1391
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,839
the bottom to the organizational

1392
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,500
techniques

1393
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,420
oh one a little too far

1394
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,940
things like bug Bounty and vulnerability

1395
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,619
disclosure these are not things that you

1396
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:43,319
individually deploy or use right these

1397
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:44,760
are things that your organization uses

1398
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,099
by the way Optus didn't have either one

1399
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:48,000
of those

1400
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,800
might be a problem

1401
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,900
um uh but things like

1402
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,760
sovereignty

1403
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,040
sovereignty is a task in the sense that

1404
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,559
you need to decide on an application by

1405
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,680
application environment by environment

1406
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,660
way whether or not you have sovereignty

1407
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,640
concerns that you need to address right

1408
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,319
that's why it's in this particular

1409
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,660
section and I call out several places

1410
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,339
where Southern entity is is specific

1411
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,440
mentioned including ISO 27001 and also

1412
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,680
27002

1413
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,780
so and you'll see things like seam and

1414
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,400
threat modeling because

1415
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,119
part of my purpose here was to reach out

1416
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,220
to security teams and bring them into

1417
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,800
this right so if I include things that

1418
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,079
are clearly in their space

1419
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,359
that brings them into the process and

1420
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,700
that was part of the point here

1421
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,819
um

1422
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,160
if I scroll back up to

1423
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,380
deployment

1424
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,760
deployment is the biggest one I think

1425
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,520
there's 18 different tasks in deployment

1426
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,119
um

1427
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,540
things like encrypt traffic right this

1428
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,400
is a task that you have to implement at

1429
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,319
multiple places right so it's not one

1430
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,000
thing supplemented one place it's

1431
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,260
something that's implemented in multiple

1432
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,599
places you know you can do that

1433
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,280
anyhow in a bunch of different places

1434
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,559
the point is though is that you should

1435
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,960
do it and if you're part of this devsec

1436
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,220
apps

1437
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,460
um uh process at your organization

1438
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,339
you should be thinking individually is

1439
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:18,839
is there someone that's like is there

1440
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:22,260
some part of my role where I can help to

1441
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,640
do that

1442
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,720
um so many of these things are simple

1443
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,700
things like use a valid SSL certificate

1444
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,579
right these are simple things right but

1445
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:33,960
ultimately they need to be something

1446
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,079
that is on that Playbook that you make

1447
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:38,400
sure you address for each one of these

1448
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,020
applications in application environments

1449
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,540
and that's why it's on this list

1450
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,760
so

1451
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,079
who's back over here

1452
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,740
wrapping this bad boy up

1453
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,599
what is the future holding

1454
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:55,260
um

1455
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,280
definitely going to add a second

1456
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,319
markdown page it'll have more details

1457
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,960
about each particular task

1458
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,400
um we're at we're going to add that

1459
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,380
specific mapping I saw a couple people

1460
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,200
nod when I said that add more compliance

1461
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,400
Frameworks we've already got several

1462
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,700
more that we've got queued up and add

1463
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,160
the ability to sort and priority

1464
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,079
probably by priority and difficulty so

1465
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,400
we're thinking about actually creating a

1466
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,319
static app that allows you to just sort

1467
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:20,640
you can say hey just show me the number

1468
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,720
ones

1469
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,960
just show me the the easy right that

1470
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,520
sounds weirder than Mike

1471
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,380
um sorry about that

1472
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,859
um uh and finally we're looking to find

1473
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:34,440
more collaborators so my my ask today is

1474
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,819
that if you're interested in helping out

1475
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:38,760
with this it's a public repo it's been

1476
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,680
fort

1477
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,130
it's been forked a few times

1478
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,819
[Music]

1479
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:46,440
thank you cheers

1480
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,160
um it's been forced 150 times

1481
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,460
um yeah right on got a few stars

1482
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,300
um

1483
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,099
but yeah we're always looking for more

1484
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,260
people to collaborate I did this mostly

1485
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,300
on my own didn't any I didn't do this

1486
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,980
for a commercial game I did this because

1487
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,960
I needed this and I thought other people

1488
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,760
