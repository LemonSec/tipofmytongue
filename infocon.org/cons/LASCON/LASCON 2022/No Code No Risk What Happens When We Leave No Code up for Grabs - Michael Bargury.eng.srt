[Music]

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,300
okay so uh thank you everyone for coming

7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,739
my name is Michael we're going to talk

8
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,100
about a low code no code the one thing

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm going to guarantee about this talk

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,040
is that it's going to be different from

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,900
the ones that you've heard in the last

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,880
couple of days I'm not sure if that's a

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
good or a bad thing but uh you'll decide

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,260
so

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,000
um briefly about me

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,520
um I I've been working around the local

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,799
no code security for the last uh three

18
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,439
to four years spent uh several years at

19
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,200
Microsoft as part of the CTO division uh

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,380
at agiles

21
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,960
focused on iot API Security application

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,479
security really all around about a year

23
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,979
and a half and a half ago I co-founded

24
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,600
generally which is a company focused on

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,700
local local security that's also where I

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,979
get the visibility to uh to to discuss

27
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,320
these things today I also lead an OS

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,420
group that is dedicated to uh to

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,180
security risks for local non code and

30
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,119
this we're going to show a lot of that

31
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,680
work today

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,720
um there's a bunch of more information

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,939
out there uh you can you can see my

34
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,159
links in there so if you're interested

35
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,200
um Reach Out

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
here's what we're going to do today in

37
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,700
uh in this talk so the first thing is

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,920
kind of figuring out what local no code

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,598
is making sure that we are going to

40
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
speak the same language we're going to

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
see how just how pervasive this is uh in

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,500
large organizations

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,420
um you'll see this in a moment but it's

44
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,700
very surprising how fast this thing is

45
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,739
growing within the Enterprise

46
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,840
um we'll understand how does the sdlc

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,819
translate to the world of local

48
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,800
development and then we'll go through

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,260
the OS top 10 and figure out what are

50
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,879
the actual risks that we're seeing in

51
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
these types of applications

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,660
so

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,700
um the next slide I'm going to going to

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,200
show you is probably the most important

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,379
slide in this entire talk

56
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,260
this is actually random this is a

57
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,480
Anonymous statistics from a single

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,519
organization a single Fortune 500

59
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,860
organization and you're seeing the

60
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,900
number of applications that they have

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,720
within the organization that will build

62
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,540
with uh with low codes and you know and

63
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,459
this this is another exaggerated numbers

64
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,980
these are actually numbers for real

65
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,980
customer environment and now the amazing

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,319
thing about this is just the rate of

67
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,140
growth uh we'll talk in a moment about

68
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,400
who's building those types of

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,980
applications these are not uh this is

70
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,019
not only Built by it over professional

71
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,540
developers this is mostly built by

72
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,640
business professionals and this is also

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,739
why this graph is uh is so interesting

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,900
and it's also why this entire subject is

75
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,599
important it's because with these kind

76
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,879
of numbers our traditional approaches

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,959
manual interventions Security reviews

78
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,420
those won't really help so we'll see

79
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,500
what we can do

80
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,480
um let's try and figure out how did low

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,480
code get into uh into such high numbers

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,819
and also uh we'll figure out we'll make

83
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,200
sure that we are all speaking the same

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,780
language about what no code is

85
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,299
um this tries to capture the reason

86
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,239
behind local we all understand that it

87
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,360
can only do so much and the business has

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,900
uh has multiple different needs and um

89
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,360
of course this is a kind of a perennial

90
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,099
problem it's been around for a long time

91
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,239
and there are many different

92
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,340
technologies that are trying to bring

93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,500
basically more power to the hands of the

94
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,358
business users so they can solve their

95
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,399
own problems if this sounds familiar

96
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
it's because uh it is so

97
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,340
this is low code is just one point in a

98
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,740
large Trend across multiple years of it

99
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,560
decentralization giving more power to

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,660
people that are non-technical and the

101
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,060
cool thing about this is that of course

102
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,040
the the folks in the business they are

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,479
the ones that can impact the business

104
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,180
the most this is what makes this uh very

105
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,580
important in terms of what people are

106
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,100
building here so there are a whole bunch

107
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,960
of of stuff and we'll see concrete

108
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,120
examples but people are building like a

109
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,100
small automation so if something happens

110
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,560
in my email or if if somebody uploads

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,540
their file to SharePoint then do

112
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,620
something else

113
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,600
they plug things together they also

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,300
build business applications that are

115
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,340
about facilitating a specific uh

116
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,860
workflow and you'll see examples for

117
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,900
that in a moment and it's all kind of a

118
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,540
drag and drop and these platforms have

119
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,340
really matured in the last uh in the

120
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,800
last few years which makes this actually

121
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,540
kind of a reality so people are using

122
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,880
these applications

123
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,280
it's going within within the Enterprise

124
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,039
now one of the uh one of the things that

125
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,639
that is most that drives the kind of the

126
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,220
accelerated growth of this area is the

127
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,139
fact that these low code no code

128
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,880
applications you don't really have to

129
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,220
decide as an organization that you're

130
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,440
going to use them you don't really get

131
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,199
the choice and here's the reason why all

132
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,820
of the vendors that you're seeing here

133
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,300
but actually more than that every major

134
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,479
SAS vendor has been shifting to become

135
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,580
kind of a local local platform in the

136
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,479
last few years and this means that first

137
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,000
of all this is always out there in most

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
organizations right because which

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,960
Enterprise is not a Microsoft or a

140
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,419
service now or sales or Salesforce User

141
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,820
it's kind of non-existent the second

142
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,220
thing is that this also means that these

143
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,160
low code apps by definition they are uh

144
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,759
they they work closely to business data

145
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,000
they operate they transact with business

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,340
data which makes this really important

147
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,639
for us for us to tackle

148
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,819
now this is the kind of value pop behind

149
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,400
behind low code the main idea is

150
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,319
reducing the barrier to entry to become

151
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,900
a to build to build your own things to

152
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,880
become a kind of a developer and you

153
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,500
don't have to worry about all of the

154
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,120
little details like authentication and

155
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,520
user management uh and and you'll see in

156
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,020
a moment that a whole bunch of other

157
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,900
things are are not really covered

158
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,539
um let's what one of the things that I'm

159
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,819
sure you're thinking and recalling the

160
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,280
graphs that I that I showed earlier

161
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,680
um the one important question is kind of

162
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,259
one what type of what types of apps are

163
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,600
these how how big are they how important

164
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,560
are they

165
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
so

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,520
um in recent years we've seen low code

167
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,080
applications really become business

168
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
critical or some of them at least really

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,860
become business critical and let me show

170
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,800
you a few complete examples so we uh so

171
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,860
you have some some example in mind

172
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,020
um this application actually comes from

173
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,759
Microsoft so when you go and visit

174
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,880
Microsoft offices physically you need to

175
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,699
provide your copy the vaccination proof

176
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,160
the application that facilitates that

177
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,460
upload of that file is is a low code app

178
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,940
that was built by uh by uh by the teams

179
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,979
that are in charge of of the buildings

180
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,620
there so kind of the physical physical

181
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,259
offices and of course this application

182
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,440
handles uh Health Data so it's kind of

183
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
important to make sure that they secure

184
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,900
that the data is being kept somewhere

185
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,660
that is safe but because this is being

186
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,599
developed outside of it outside of the

187
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,580
development teams it's not really part

188
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,819
of of our kind of discussion right it's

189
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,880
really it's really um it's farther away

190
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
from security

191
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,680
let's see another example uh slack

192
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,020
famously is one of wokato's largest

193
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,840
customer wokato is a like an automation

194
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,940
platform integration Automation and

195
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,639
slack has built their entire order to

196
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,400
Cache uh facility facilitated entire

197
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,120
order to catch a process through through

198
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,620
these automations the drag and drop

199
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,080
automations and there are tens of tens

200
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,458
of these automations that facilitate

201
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,860
this process but of course just imagine

202
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,640
kind of the uh all of the different

203
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,320
systems all of the different uh data

204
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,779
stores that need to be that need to be

205
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,300
connected to in order to facilitate this

206
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,800
kind of process and of course this is a

207
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
business critical process

208
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,880
let's see another example and it's going

209
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,920
to be a bit different

210
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
so in this example

211
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,140
um there's a there's a team inside

212
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,720
Microsoft that is in charge of product

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,399
launches uh kind of part of their

214
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,339
marketing team and uh um and they

215
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,560
figured out that they have different

216
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,660
processes in order to do this product

217
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,300
launches and they wanted to to make kind

218
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,640
of one application that would be

219
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,519
basically a to-do list where you can uh

220
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,320
fill out anything that you need to do

221
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,940
all of the all of the information is

222
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,060
already there so it took the the teams

223
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,980
inside marketing to build an application

224
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,019
to streamline this process about two

225
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,120
days right people from the marketing

226
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,660
department uh and the The crucial thing

227
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,000
here about this uh this and this became

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,740
kind of the thing that they're using so

229
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,320
of course uh after a while I think I've

230
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,480
took note of it and started to maintain

231
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,580
it themselves but the crucial piece here

232
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,220
is that this was built by uh by a

233
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,720
business team not by professional

234
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,760
developers and of course when that shift

235
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,000
happens a lot of other things change so

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,580
um this also kind of tells the story of

237
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,260
the graph and we'll see this in a moment

238
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,040
but low code kind of made the um uh the

239
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,740
transition from something that is pushed

240
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,660
to professional developers to make their

241
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,459
lives easier to something that is being

242
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,800
addressed mostly to business users and

243
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,260
let's try and see the shift uh and and

244
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,240
specifically I'm gonna Focus uh on

245
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
Microsoft today or at least right now

246
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
because uh first of all they're in most

247
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,800
organizations so and also they'll pretty

248
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
much live in this space in terms of

249
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
going to business users or directing

250
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,899
those Technologies to business users

251
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,640
here's a a quote from Satya Nadella 2018

252
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,019
talking about Power Platform which is

253
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,019
the local platform built into office and

254
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,660
you can see that the way that he talks

255
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,700
about low code is very much about

256
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,860
extendability this is nothing about

257
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,500
business enablement this this was mostly

258
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,540
a way for Microsoft

259
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,060
to help their Partners build things

260
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,000
around Dynamic so extend Dynamics and

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,740
you can see the the very the same thing

262
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,540
with Salesforce right so Salesforce has

263
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,220
a bunch of different extendability

264
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,920
features Apex code a whole bunch of

265
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,019
features that are around basically

266
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,720
custom customizing your CRM this is

267
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,959
something that we see that we see a kind

268
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,700
of uh this is what it is this is where

269
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,220
this started as a way to accelerate

270
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,839
professional developers and just make

271
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,019
their life easier let's see this a quote

272
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,980
from uh from Satya a year later

273
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,040
you can see that the message here is

274
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,440
drastically different okay this is not

275
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,779
talking about extendability this is

276
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,279
about business enablement about

277
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,279
enablement of business users and

278
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,260
um one clue that we have here but why

279
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,420
why did you make this shift is the

280
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,579
number that 2.5 million citizen

281
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,740
developers you can see that of course

282
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,959
when they uh when you think about low

283
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,940
code as an extendability framework the

284
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,440
number of users is it's going to be

285
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,420
pretty small but when you think about it

286
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,339
as business enablement when you target

287
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,620
this technology to business user it

288
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,600
becomes the target audience becomes

289
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,540
becomes much larger

290
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,480
and the and one other quote that that

291
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,700
Satya given on the same year so you're

292
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,440
seeing the second quote here for Excel

293
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,399
this is the kind of the crucial piece

294
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
they're thinking about this as the way

295
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,500
to uh as the new Excel as a way to

296
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,620
basically bring more capabilities to

297
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,540
people all around the industry and and

298
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,940
and thinking about the kind of impact

299
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,040
that Excel had the number of jobs today

300
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,959
that use Excel this is where they

301
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,959
they're aiming with no code as well

302
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,899
now this is three years later you can

303
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,519
see that the number of users that

304
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,320
Microsoft has on their platform is now

305
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,399
20 million so about 10x golf almost

306
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,220
um and so this is really taking off uh

307
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,779
and and the reason why this is taking

308
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,639
off is well because they just decided

309
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,260
that this is going to happen again

310
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,480
nobody is asking organizations whether

311
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,760
they want this within the org it's just

312
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,820
part of Salesforce part of office so

313
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,800
it's already there

314
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,420
um

315
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,899
and one thing that we haven't seen so

316
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,940
far so I I showed you a few applications

317
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,920
we discussed kind of the growth of this

318
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,779
area but one thing that we're missing

319
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,279
and I want to make sure that we're all

320
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,500
clear about is just how easy it is to to

321
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,820
make this to build these applications

322
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,980
because that's crucial for you to

323
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,959
actually believe that people within the

324
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,279
business departments can actually build

325
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,440
this on their own

326
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,500
so I'm gonna show you uh an example uh

327
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,079
in a moment basically this is a silly

328
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,060
example but uh we'll be using slack in

329
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,339
my organization and slack has this

330
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,139
annoying feature where people can

331
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,139
mention you in a in a public Channel and

332
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:43,920
then

333
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,959
um you're expected to apply pretty

334
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,639
quickly which is kind of annoying so

335
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,560
what I'm going to do here in this in

336
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,560
this automation is basically let me

337
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,860
let's see that it works

338
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,600
so what I'm going to build is a simple

339
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,399
automation that every time somebody

340
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,680
mentions me in a public Channel it will

341
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,019
automatically change my status as if I'm

342
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,060
on a call so people will kind of think

343
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,519
that I'm not available right now and a

344
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,740
few minutes later

345
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,480
it will remove that that status so

346
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,579
nobody will suspect that I did anything

347
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,620
wrong now this is of course a silly

348
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,139
example uh and as I speak you can see

349
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,120
how this is being created this entire

350
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
video is kind of a couple of minutes you

351
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,200
can see that this is a pretty

352
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,180
sophisticated application right just in

353
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,740
terms of the number of things that it

354
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,540
needs to handle it needs to authenticate

355
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,700
to slack it needs to uh to store a

356
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,079
secret because somehow this

357
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,940
authentication needs to work it's

358
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,160
subscribe to a web hook on the slack

359
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,040
side it needs to support apis these apis

360
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
can change so there's a lot of

361
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,880
complexity here there's a delay step

362
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,100
because I need to kind of wait between

363
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,839
the time that I change the status and

364
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,480
the first time and the second time so

365
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,399
this is a significant piece of software

366
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,079
I'm building this in a couple of minutes

367
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,199
and this is all drag and drop one of the

368
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,360
things that you're not seeing and if

369
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,860
you're keeping close eye on the video

370
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,680
one one thing that you will uh that you

371
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,320
won't see here is authentication you you

372
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,880
didn't see any kind of pop-up window

373
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,339
that uh that asked me for credentials or

374
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,440
anything and this just kind of magically

375
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,459
happened

376
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:15,959
um and the reason why this is this

377
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,699
magically happened is that because one

378
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,279
of the key features of these of these uh

379
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,720
platforms is that um they basically make

380
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,600
it very easy to share credentials they

381
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
make it very easy to share identities

382
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,500
between users and this is important

383
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,720
because uh and we'll see we'll see that

384
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,260
in a moment but basically this is the

385
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,959
enabler of the golf if you would uh in

386
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,880
if any time you would build such an

387
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,199
application you need to go through

388
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,240
approval processes you would never build

389
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,160
anything but if you can just plug in

390
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,740
your own identity and continue on or

391
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,120
somebody else's identity because they

392
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,620
have the right permissions then

393
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,199
everything works well and also we will

394
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,740
dive into that uh later

395
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,940
much deeper

396
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,880
okay so we understand how easy it is I

397
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,680
encourage you to play around this is

398
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,779
kind of you you'll just see how how

399
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,480
quickly how quickly uh you can build

400
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,279
kind of applications this is an

401
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,380
automation but basically you can also

402
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,820
build a mobile apps you can build

403
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,279
portals for for web apps uh kind of

404
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,839
there are many different options

405
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,699
okay

406
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,639
so

407
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,860
this the reason why uh now is the time

408
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,620
to discuss low code or local no code is

409
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,380
that we have a several different facts a

410
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,420
few different factors that all combine

411
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,180
in a single time one thing is that the

412
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,279
big vendors have a very strong

413
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,440
initiative to push this forward you can

414
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
just just imagine kind of uh thinking

415
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,940
being part of Salesforce or being part

416
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,160
of Microsoft and seeing kind of how they

417
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,920
can extend the number of developers that

418
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,300
are using their platforms from

419
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,560
professional developers to business

420
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,139
users so the business impact for them is

421
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,720
is huge the second the second reason is

422
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,579
that this is really necessary so

423
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,500
companies need a way to accelerate

424
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,500
business and you cannot really rely on

425
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,720
just hiring more developers we all know

426
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,299
that that is very difficult and the last

427
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,980
thing is that the technology is really

428
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,020
there so there were a few attempts in

429
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,579
the in the past to to build these

430
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,439
application generators this one really

431
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,599
works this one is able to generate

432
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,939
applications that are really useful

433
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,520
so now we understand why local is

434
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,079
important and why it is important to

435
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,660
talk about it now the next thing I want

436
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,520
to show you before we go into concrete

437
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,740
risks is how are these things being

438
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,860
developed so how does the sdlc translate

439
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,880
to the world of of no code no code

440
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,720
here's um kind of the familiar stlc I I

441
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,120
won't spend a lot of time here this is

442
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,700
kind of an attempt to uh to say which

443
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,000
which uh which Persona is in charge of

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,520
each of each step so uh something gets

445
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,500
uh the business thinks about the problem

446
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,480
it goes to engineering they plan a

447
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,340
solution they Implement that solution

448
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,580
they verify they test it deploy monitor

449
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,700
it and then manage the software as it as

450
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,559
it goes as it's live and as it needs to

451
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,140
be updated let's try to

452
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,840
um and and again I'm uh this is kind of

453
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,340
uh

454
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,559
this is generic I'm going to uh to to

455
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,000
leave it at that

456
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,700
um the next slide I'm going to show you

457
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,100
is basically how does this translate to

458
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,020
the world of no code

459
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,260
so when you think about it from the from

460
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,539
the perspective of a business user they

461
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,400
start when a business user is able to

462
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,260
build their own application they start

463
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,480
with finding an issue they have some

464
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,940
sort of an issue they need to solve and

465
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,140
then

466
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,720
they just do it okay they don't need to

467
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,660
plan they don't go through Gates there's

468
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,179
no testing I mean there can be testing

469
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,460
but nobody's requiring them to do this

470
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,020
testing because the business user is the

471
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,760
one that is actually doing the entire

472
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,179
the entire cycle now of course if you if

473
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,280
you've been working with with low code

474
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,679
some organizations are doing this kind

475
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:05,700
of very professionally some

476
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,980
organizations are using the traditional

477
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,620
stlc follow code but this isn't this is

478
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,720
really not the majority

479
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,820
um and this is really not pushed by the

480
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,120
platforms one of the the the hit save to

481
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,340
deploy is is pretty much the the

482
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,140
mentality in most of these platforms so

483
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,880
you build an application you click save

484
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,559
like I just showed you with a with this

485
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,100
API with a slack automation once I

486
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,720
complete I hit save this is in

487
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
production this is running that's it I

488
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
don't need to do anything else

489
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,299
um

490
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,480
the this is at the root of why a low

491
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,580
code is successful it just becomes

492
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,679
easier when they're not when there's not

493
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
not many that uh there's not a lot of

494
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,360
stakeholders around the table you can

495
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,419
iterate very quickly but the gates of

496
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,580
course are there for a reason so in

497
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,380
large Enterprises security is important

498
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,240
compliance is important privacy and so

499
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,840
on and so these get neglected in in most

500
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,100
of the cases

501
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,860
one last thing I need to cover before I

502
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,140
show you concrete risks is why is this

503
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,000
your problem why do you need to think

504
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,679
about it because one of the things that

505
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,120
that I've been hearing when I'm talking

506
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,340
to people about about the space is well

507
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,140
uh Microsoft has introduced this sales

508
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,880
person to introduce this this is their

509
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,820
problem they need to fix it

510
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,240
and while while this is somewhat true

511
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,580
we need to remember the lessons that we

512
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,740
learned from from the public Cloud so

513
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,720
when the public when the public Cloud

514
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,880
started people were saying okay I'm

515
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,100
going to Azure I'm going to AWS this is

516
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,260
they need to take charge of security

517
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,480
right but today we understand that

518
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,980
there's a share the responsibility model

519
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,600
they cannot be in charge of what you

520
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,760
build they are in charge of building of

521
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,260
securing of building secure building

522
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,020
blocks but us as the organizations that

523
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,640
are actually building applications we

524
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,380
are in charge of those applications and

525
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,840
the same thing applies for low code and

526
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,520
this is the part that gets neglected

527
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,460
because usually security teams are not

528
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,740
part of the development cycle for local

529
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,080
applications it's if it's it's sometimes

530
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,820
it's even not part of the kind of scope

531
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,280
of responsibility which means that this

532
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,799
gets left out uh and and we'll see in a

533
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,799
moment what kind of risk occur uh due to

534
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,820
that

535
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,360
so

536
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,100
the rest of the talk we're going to talk

537
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,440
about the the largest risks that we see

538
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,660
for local Docker applications and the

539
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,340
number one thing uh

540
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,200
uh that like one thing that you need to

541
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,419
know before we go into that is how did

542
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,580
we come up with this list I mean where

543
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,679
is it coming from so

544
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,679
um we started off about uh almost two

545
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,240
years ago with the office with the

546
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,419
overscope for uh for for local no code

547
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,179
and uh since then we've scanned more

548
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,260
than uh the 100 000 applications

549
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,900
something like that uh across different

550
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,299
organizations we've been joined by uh

551
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,460
people from Palo Alto and for Microsoft

552
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,620
and other companies as well so this is

553
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,059
now kind of a cross company

554
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,400
collaboration and um

555
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,159
I have basically two uh two goals for

556
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,200
this talk one is to kind of raise

557
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,760
awareness for this issue and the other

558
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,220
is to bring more people to the to the OS

559
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,620
group so if you're interested uh reach

560
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,299
out to me

561
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,539
okay so here's what uh here are the top

562
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,059
10 and uh again this is all based on

563
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,799
what we're seeing in actual live

564
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,020
environments

565
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,659
uh and we'll go through concrete

566
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,940
examples for for the top risks by the

567
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,320
way this is kind of an intimate setting

568
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,419
so if you have any question feel free to

569
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,820
kind of write it during the talk

570
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,760
I think it would be a nice okay let's

571
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,360
start with the first risk so the imagine

572
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,860
that you all

573
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,080
um that you are in charge of I don't

574
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,120
know Microsoft or Salesforce so some

575
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,220
other uh some other platform that is

576
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,980
already in large organizations but is

577
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,380
trying to push this uh Business

578
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,820
Development notion all this local

579
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,039
development notion the number one the

580
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,200
thing that will stop you is permissions

581
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,900
if any time a business user would like

582
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,120
to to build an application they need to

583
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,740
ask for permissions nothing is going to

584
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,440
happen and so how do you circumvent that

585
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,260
issue the way that the platforms work is

586
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,780
that when the uh when you is that

587
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,480
basically they allow users to connect

588
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,539
wherever they want FTP server SQL

589
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,940
servers their own identity to slack or

590
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,580
to teams or whatever and then they copy

591
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,039
the refresh token and then they and they

592
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,380
reuse it and more than reusing it they

593
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,179
allow the users to share it between

594
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,460
themselves and this leads

595
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,200
to the first risk which is the

596
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,140
counterpersonation basically in many

597
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,179
cases applications are being built with

598
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,640
the Maker's identity built into the

599
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,500
application which means that every user

600
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,720
of that application ends up using the

601
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,419
Maker's identity when they uh when they

602
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,460
operate and so let's see a real world

603
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,480
example

604
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,520
this is from an A from a nickel

605
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,220
e-commerce company basically they had a

606
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,159
they had a problem where the people

607
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,500
inside of the company that were part of

608
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,659
kind of are trying to help a customer

609
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,419
with a with a with a customer case uh

610
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,280
with kind of a ticket they didn't have

611
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,440
access to see the history for that

612
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
customer and so they didn't have the

613
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,580
right context customers were faster

614
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,620
frustrated the customer care team was

615
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,460
frustrated so what they what they wanted

616
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,620
to do is build some sort of an

617
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,960
application that allows everybody in the

618
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,600
organization to to fetch information

619
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,400
related to the cases that they they work

620
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,240
with

621
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,640
now uh of course you'll see in the

622
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,260
challenge here again getting those

623
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,240
permissions this is a bit difficult so

624
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,559
here's the solution that the customer

625
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,280
care team has uh uh has come up with

626
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,440
they basically created an application

627
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,179
they embedded within the application

628
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,400
their own identity which was an admin on

629
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,620
the customer database and of course

630
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,780
within the application they did handle

631
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,700
permissions so they did make sense make

632
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,980
sure that every user of that application

633
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,500
can only use can only see cases that

634
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
belong to that user but that was handled

635
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,820
on the application on the application

636
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,740
layer the connection to the database

637
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,860
still use an admin connection

638
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,960
when you think about it from the you can

639
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,700
see that the impact was was good I mean

640
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,200
this this was actually running for a few

641
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,600
months so employees are happy everybody

642
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,880
is Happy from this situation

643
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,340
unless you're in the sock

644
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,679
um and so here's what happened

645
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,200
from the socks perspective there's no

646
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,600
application because this is a shared

647
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,760
refresh token this is just a bunch of

648
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,679
people across the Enterprise for

649
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,320
multiple machines running multiple

650
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,600
queries on their database it looks like

651
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,520
scraping looks like some kind of an

652
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,220
attack so it took them a few weeks to

653
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,260
figure out what's going on who's

654
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,000
creating those who's creating those

655
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,059
queries and and kind of reaching out to

656
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,799
finding that this is actually an

657
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,600
application finding who built this

658
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,460
application and then just imagine this

659
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,260
conversation between somebody from the

660
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,000
customer care team somebody from the

661
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,380
soccer team discussing this application

662
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,179
and the security implications I mean

663
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,919
it's it's really difficult

664
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,700
and so

665
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,640
and so of course the problem here is

666
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,480
that

667
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,360
um nobody it doesn't matter who accesses

668
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,580
the application the connection Remains

669
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,340
the Same now there's a there's there are

670
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,799
many other kind of uh even if they're

671
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,140
after even after this was fixed there

672
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,480
are many other other problems there the

673
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,820
connections themselves can be implicitly

674
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,380
shared and so you're using the

675
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,600
application and you gain implicit access

676
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
to the connection you can just use it

677
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,799
pick it up and use it later on

678
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,799
um and so this is this is kind of uh the

679
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,120
now the reason why this is the number

680
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,159
one problem is that this is very common

681
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,500
very very common I mean the number of

682
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,179
low code applications that are using

683
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,000
service accounts is really small most of

684
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,700
them use personal accounts either by the

685
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,500
maker or by the people that are using

686
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,340
them

687
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,220
so that was the first one

688
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,559
the second one the second risk is around

689
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,320
authorization and now one one thing that

690
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,700
you could be thinking is uh well

691
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,740
authorization is applications is a

692
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,600
General application security problem and

693
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,940
you're right uh but the the problem as

694
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,640
with just as we've discussed uh is is

695
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,580
becomes worse with uh with low code and

696
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,059
the reason is credential sharing so as I

697
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,860
mentioned these connections that the

698
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,440
applications are creating are actually

699
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,020
wrappers around the refresh tokens and

700
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,299
actually all of these um all of these

701
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,460
platforms have this some some kind of

702
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,799
notion of a default environment a place

703
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,600
where you develop the application the

704
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,360
place where everybody has access to the

705
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,240
shared resources this place also stores

706
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,120
shared connections and in many cases

707
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,740
this is the default so you create a

708
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,539
connection it becomes shared with the

709
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,340
entire default environment if you're

710
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,400
using Microsoft API or volcato check out

711
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,980
these default environments you'll see in

712
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,320
large organizations I mean we've seen a

713
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,720
SQL code range credentials to to

714
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
production databases people's own

715
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,820
accounts to office or to Outlook and

716
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,440
they are just there they're waiting for

717
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,960
somebody to pick them up and use them

718
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,900
and again keep in mind that there's a

719
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,640
reason for that this this makes these

720
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,919
applications run faster this makes the

721
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,779
entire development process run run

722
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,039
faster of course from a security

723
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,900
perspective it doesn't make sense at all

724
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,659
to share those credentials uh in a way

725
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,960
that uh that by by sharing the refresh

726
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,760
tokens and one more thing that I'm going

727
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,679
to say about about this this kind of

728
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,260
problem about the kind of a credential

729
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,600
sharing issue is that if you think about

730
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,120
it in term if you think in terms of

731
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,700
detection how would we detect that

732
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,799
somebody is using these refresh tokens

733
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,900
this sharing those connections from the

734
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,240
existing infrastructure that we have I

735
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,200
mean from the network security

736
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,120
perspective from the application

737
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,340
security perspective the logs that you

738
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,860
all already have none of them will tell

739
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,659
you that this application even exists

740
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,500
right this I mean every time somebody

741
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,179
uses this application they end up going

742
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,760
to the database with the same all to the

743
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,980
API with with the same refresh token

744
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,140
from multiple different places the

745
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,640
application doesn't exist in terms of

746
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,799
the uh the current observability that

747
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,720
you have and this is the main issue

748
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,120
this is more than this is kind of a this

749
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,620
is a crucial point because basically

750
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,960
this means that low code in many cases

751
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,820
breaks the assumptions that we have

752
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,779
around permission management

753
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,700
one other problem around the

754
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,840
authorization is that we see

755
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,299
people basically people want to do the

756
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,799
right thing they want to build an

757
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,240
application that has a different

758
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,340
interface for using an admin for example

759
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,520
but doing that on the connection level

760
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,220
is difficult so they simply do it in the

761
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,620
in the UI level on the client side and

762
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,960
so in many times in many cases this is a

763
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
very common in Salesforce for example so

764
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,559
you build a custom application in

765
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,480
Salesforce and this application has

766
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,000
users and admins both of both these

767
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,980
users the users and admins see a

768
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,140
different kind of UI but if you look

769
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,179
behind the scenes at the API they have

770
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,100
the same permissions they can do the

771
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,899
same things

772
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,159
okay

773
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,640
the next risk is around a data leakage

774
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,240
and the second thing here is

775
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,580
unexpected consequences and and uh just

776
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,899
imagine what happens when you have in

777
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,120
your organization 70 000 different apps

778
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,340
all of them connecting different kinds

779
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,419
of services uh things get uh connected

780
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,940
and you're already not sure uh how it's

781
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,520
really difficult to find what is to find

782
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,720
out what are the all of these

783
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,039
automations that are being that are

784
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,140
moving data uh between between different

785
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,679
different places so here's an example uh

786
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,679
and this one is uh I I mean every

787
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,480
organization that I've that I worked

788
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,340
with to find out what what's happening

789
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,980
with your local platform uh uh this

790
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,419
example occurred

791
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,039
um basically it's another way to

792
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,840
expeditate email outside of your

793
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,700
organization so if you're using some

794
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,279
sort of a DLP solution to block people

795
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,140
from for example forwarding email to the

796
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,120
personal Gmail uh this is very common

797
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,940
right but you do it on the uh on the

798
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,279
server on the email server oh of the

799
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,559
client or many other things in this in

800
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,600
this example what people are doing is

801
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,000
that they're actually copying the data

802
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,159
so for every time they get an email they

803
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,440
copy the content of the email and they

804
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,659
paste it in their own personal personal

805
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,779
box again automated and so you won't

806
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,240
find it in the email logs DLP Solutions

807
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,539
won't cut it for you this is again very

808
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,860
very common across different

809
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,380
organizations

810
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,500
here's a um one one funny example uh

811
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,539
with one of one of our kind of uh one of

812
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,120
the earlier cast earliest customers I

813
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,039
work with uh we kind of scanned their

814
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,980
wokato environment and we found uh this

815
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,520
kind of automation that was sinking uh

816
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,740
an account for a Vendo uh the Vendo has

817
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,960
had their own personal Gmail account and

818
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,279
their cope with account and they were

819
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,720
folding folding email from their

820
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,039
corporate account to their Gmail account

821
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,500
and this sync was still up and running

822
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,299
three years after the vendor was left

823
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,899
the organization

824
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,580
here's another example

825
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,159
um it's very easy to create to create

826
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,100
disruptions with this kind of Technology

827
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,200
this is kind of a this is a simple

828
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,899
example where basically it builds a kind

829
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,299
of a ransomware with that uh with uh

830
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,299
completely with with low code so it's

831
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,919
pretty easy right I go to a SharePoint

832
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,440
site I list all of the files I encrypt

833
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,120
them with a handy encrypt function that

834
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,279
is provided by the platform and then I

835
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,159
replace replace the existing files

836
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,840
actually if you're interested in in that

837
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,159
perspective in the attacker's

838
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,799
perspective on local no code there was a

839
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,720
whole bunch of information we put out

840
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,159
there there were a couple of talks at

841
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,460
Defcon uh so uh uh look it up online

842
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,299
there's a lot of information

843
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,760
next up uh authentication and

844
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,559
authorization

845
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,100
um when you create those applications

846
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,020
the reason why they are useful is that

847
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,880
because they they connect they connect

848
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,360
to different uh corporate data sets when

849
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,740
you do these connections you need to

850
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,779
make choices right you need to decide

851
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,399
when you connect to an FTP server you

852
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,799
need to decide whether you're using FTP

853
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,740
or ftps when you when you plug into a

854
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,120
Salesforce you need to decide whether

855
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,679
you're going to sandbox environment or

856
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,179
not there are a lot of these choices

857
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,700
that are around creating secure

858
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,919
connections and now who's making those

859
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,080
choices again business users so of

860
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,240
course they don't know uh what are the

861
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,159
implications of those choices which

862
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,399
makes which which means that we see uh

863
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:44,700
things we thought we have solved uh uh

864
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,539
uh a long time ago like FTP rather than

865
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,820
ftps within large organizations again

866
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,019
this is something that we're saying

867
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:52,980
today

868
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,019
um and so of course this is not really

869
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,399
something we can expect from business

870
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,919
users it's not the the job to do it it's

871
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,220
our job to kind of make it make it easy

872
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,480
for them to make the right choice

873
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:08,940
the next problem that we're saying is

874
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,520
security misconfiguration now again this

875
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,199
is something that is common to every

876
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,260
platform once it starts to grow I mean

877
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,780
when the platform is small it has a very

878
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,399
limited amount of features and it's

879
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,219
difficult to um and most of them are

880
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,159
kind of can't try to be secure by Design

881
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,739
but when you grow as a platform for

882
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,239
example when you want to create an

883
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,280
application when the platform wants to

884
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,780
offer an application that is available

885
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,199
for anonymous users without logins so

886
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,820
you have to have an API that exposes

887
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,440
information to Anonymous users that's a

888
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,239
fine that's a that's a that's a valid

889
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,399
use case but now you need to choose

890
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,859
which apis are exposed to Anonymous

891
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:49,500
users and which are not and of course as

892
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,879
we as we know

893
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,139
um when you're making these choices

894
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,599
you're going to make wrong decisions and

895
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,820
so we're seeing a lot of problems that

896
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,460
are very similar to the open S3 bucket

897
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,320
that we as an industry have been trying

898
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,780
to tackle for a few years now and these

899
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,420
again pop up again here so let me show

900
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,460
you a concrete example

901
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,540
Microsoft has a one of the the types of

902
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,040
application that they expose is called

903
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,380
Portal app this is an application that

904
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,480
again that is exposed to Anonymous users

905
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,359
so for example if you want to uh if you

906
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,460
want to build a Vendor Portal for your

907
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,220
vendors to kind of uh sign up and then

908
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,200
log in and fetch information about the

909
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,020
relationship with you then you can use

910
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,720
this Portal app in order to to

911
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,599
facilitate that this sport that app

912
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,980
exposes an API for anonymous users and

913
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,560
again this is this makes sense right no

914
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,020
not everybody has a login the problem

915
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,900
here was that the default setting for

916
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,480
this folder was exposing the entire API

917
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,940
of the portal so all of the data sets to

918
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,560
two Anonymous users and this was the

919
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,300
default for a few years this was

920
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,280
discovered last year so you can see the

921
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,540
the result

922
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,579
um but and of course and Microsoft was

923
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,160
actually pretty uh quick in changing the

924
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,800
default which is nice but it doesn't

925
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,079
prevent people from from moving from a

926
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,300
security fault to an insecure situation

927
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,339
so

928
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,440
here's what we did

929
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,540
the all of these borders are under the

930
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,339
same

931
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:21,960
domain so it's very easy to kind of

932
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,820
enumerate these are the simple

933
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,560
subdominal enumeration and you can find

934
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,320
all of those portals and then this the

935
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,880
the way that you access the anonymous

936
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,520
data is just go by going to this odata

937
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,000
endpoint again pretty easy so let's see

938
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,820
how many of them we can find today

939
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,460
uh here's an example of of how this

940
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,320
looks like you can see uh kind of I'm

941
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,720
going to this odata endpoint by the way

942
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,839
this is a this example is from a real uh

943
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,960
portal that we found for a loud back and

944
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,280
you can see that there are three

945
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,619
different entities here default has

946
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,180
really doesn't have anything really

947
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,280
interesting entity Foams that is just a

948
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,040
way to save forms but you're also seeing

949
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,460
the global variables entity interesting

950
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,680
here's what the global variables entity

951
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,760
has

952
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,579
um hardcoded secrets to uh to the Azure

953
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,520
deployment for that uh for that bank

954
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,920
um this is uh one example but we found

955
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,300
uh we found pii we found uh um assigned

956
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,099
contracts with customers and again

957
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,320
because this is in a single in a single

958
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,180
domain it's it's it's kind of it's

959
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,880
waiting for you to to kind of uh reach

960
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,280
out and do it and this is still the uh

961
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,940
the situation today so from our uh uh

962
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,040
from from us playing around with this we

963
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,680
found something like uh 50 000 different

964
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,020
portals that are available today and all

965
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,119
of them and some of them still have

966
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,520
these uh these issues

967
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,960
again

968
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,960
um this is not I mean Microsoft does

969
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,760
have some of the fault here to make it

970
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,800
they need to make it easier but actually

971
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,540
I mean users need to make the right

972
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,040
choice there is a valid use case here

973
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,660
and the people that are making these

974
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,720
choices usually business users

975
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,880
let's see another one

976
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,780
um

977
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,839
the next one is about injection handling

978
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,060
failures so here's a here's an

979
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,020
automation we saw a kind of uh a few

980
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,040
months ago a user created a way

981
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,619
basically an automation that goes

982
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,720
through an RSS feed and every time

983
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
something comes from the data set speed

984
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,800
they download the the article and they

985
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,740
push it to a SQL server and the way and

986
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,300
the way that they do it is with a kind

987
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,780
of a SQL uh query like a an arbitrary

988
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,480
query so of course this is a path to to

989
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,060
injection this is very similar to

990
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,339
injection injection surface in a

991
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,079
serverless functions where you have

992
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,900
these weird inputs and outputs that can

993
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,820
be files and and all sorts of other

994
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,220
things this is again very common Within

995
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,380
These low code applications and of

996
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,520
course

997
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,500
um business users don't really know what

998
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,820
to do with the

999
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,160
um with injection now one of the things

1000
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,380
that the platforms are saying and if you

1001
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,480
read kind of the marketing material

1002
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,359
they'll tell you that they they fixed a

1003
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,640
SQL injection they fixed injection in

1004
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,800
general and everything is all right but

1005
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,720
if you and I mean part of that is too

1006
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,640
right they have text Fields they and

1007
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,859
they sanitize the input there but when

1008
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,359
you sanitize the input you need to know

1009
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,940
uh where where this data is going is it

1010
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,280
going to be a red as Json is it going to

1011
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,320
be plugged into a SQL Server you can

1012
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,520
create a scientists from everything

1013
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,140
without knowing what's going to be the

1014
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,420
next step again this is the responsive

1015
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,480
this is our responsibility

1016
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,240
here's another one uh which is again

1017
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,839
kind of pretty obvious low code is only

1018
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,820
useful because you can drag and drop uh

1019
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,900
ready-made features like ready-made

1020
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,240
widget ready-made ready-made connectors

1021
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,700
these are part of marketplace some of

1022
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,099
them are provided by vendor others are

1023
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,560
provided by open source and so your

1024
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,660
users will go through the marketplace so

1025
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,480
we'll just find the right blogging uh

1026
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,579
pointing them together GitHub repo

1027
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,619
they'll upload something and that's it

1028
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,380
in Microsoft you can upload the dll in

1029
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,200
sapier you can run custom code these are

1030
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,760
things that are plugged directly into

1031
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,740
the platform there's no way to inventory

1032
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,300
them there's no way to know that this is

1033
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,160
actually happening and so of course

1034
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,599
there's a problem here with the

1035
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,720
dependencies and with that kind of the

1036
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,660
same we've done a lot as an industry to

1037
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,839
to be better with the open source and

1038
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:32,760
mapping out our dependencies will still

1039
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,680
add this problem with local we haven't

1040
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,339
really started

1041
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:42,300
the the next risk is around data and

1042
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,900
secret management so um in many cases we

1043
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,880
see uh basically these applications are

1044
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,619
handling sensitive data and of course

1045
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:50,880
people don't know how to handle this

1046
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,220
correctly so let me

1047
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,740
um so you you can see kind of a concrete

1048
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,119
example here but let me tell you the

1049
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,320
story around it

1050
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,040
so this is a large I.T company and the

1051
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,960
HR team basically created a giveaway

1052
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,520
campaign where you can donate money to

1053
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,160
charity so here's what they did they

1054
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,680
built an application the application

1055
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,900
asked you which how much do you want to

1056
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,359
donate to which charity and please plug

1057
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,940
in your credit card of course the credit

1058
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,940
card was collected stored in a database

1059
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,760
the database is stored unencrypted the

1060
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,619
database was part of the default

1061
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,420
environment which means it's exposed to

1062
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,280
the entire organization

1063
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,800
um so this this is pretty cool from the

1064
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,900
perspective of uh I mean how advanced

1065
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,240
this HR team is but on the security

1066
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,220
perspective is it's kind of problematic

1067
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,680
here's uh here's another one and and

1068
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,140
this one is kind of a larger

1069
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,720
um because most security teams and most

1070
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,240
it teams are not aware of this of these

1071
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,859
applications

1072
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:53,520
um

1073
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,560
there's there's really a there's really

1074
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,660
a problem here with Asset Management so

1075
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,180
the what you saw how easy it is to

1076
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,800
create those applications it's even

1077
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,020
easier to maintain them because you

1078
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,640
don't really need to do anything you

1079
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,079
don't need to update you don't need to

1080
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,480
learn anything at your on your own and

1081
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,000
so that's why you that's why you have uh

1082
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,320
the graph that you saw at the beginning

1083
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,320
of this talk because well it's very easy

1084
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,359
to create application a lot more people

1085
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,859
can create those applications of course

1086
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,960
you'll have a lot of applications and

1087
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,640
some of these applications not all of

1088
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,500
them but some of them would be used by a

1089
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,480
lot of business users without it being

1090
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,640
involved and it's really difficult to

1091
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,619
find those critical applications that

1092
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,300
you need to put under the it umbrella

1093
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,940
there's a lot of issues here around the

1094
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,280
applications that are being uh

1095
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,500
um that are left unused or applications

1096
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,180
that are actually being used by the

1097
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,220
organization and then their maker leaves

1098
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,960
the org and the application is often and

1099
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,780
nobody nobody finds it so this is

1100
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,640
another kind of common thing one of the

1101
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,619
first things that customers do uh that

1102
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,480
organizations do with they when they

1103
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,579
start to kind of address this space is

1104
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:57,960
figure out just how many of the

1105
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,900
applications can be purged in many cases

1106
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,000
it's it's a lot of them

1107
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and the last one is around uh security

1108
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,420
logging so you would expect

1109
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,880
applications that are being created in a

1110
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,500
platform that kind of generates these

1111
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,880
applications to have all of the logs

1112
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,560
that you'll want right everything can be

1113
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,140
plugged in uh that expectation would be

1114
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,800
way off the logs for for most of these

1115
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,960
most of these problems platforms are

1116
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,079
almost non-existent and and where they

1117
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,359
are the where you'll find logs you'll

1118
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,240
typically find secrets and data that is

1119
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,339
being written into those logs as an

1120
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,500
example if you're using an automation

1121
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,980
platform like zapier or vocato or power

1122
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,440
automate the actual content that goes

1123
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,480
through that automation is being written

1124
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,000
to logs and so if you're handling credit

1125
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,880
cards they are there on the logs

1126
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,240
um this is again a this is a place where

1127
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,740
the platforms themselves need to do a

1128
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,280
lot of uh to need to have kind of uh to

1129
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,200
go to a better place in terms of their

1130
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,359
maturity but this is a problem if you

1131
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,040
want to do any security login and

1132
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,839
monitoring

1133
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,280
okay

1134
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,240
so we've seen the top risks we've seen

1135
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,000
um uh uh so you know what let me I have

1136
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,640
a I have a slide for summary so why not

1137
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,500
um the first thing that we've seen and

1138
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,000
that's this is the most important

1139
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,099
crucial part here is that local is

1140
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,560
growing rapidly and it's going whether

1141
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,720
you'd like it or not this is uh this is

1142
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,700
the reality so

1143
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,980
um this is probably in this is probably

1144
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,900
in most organizations today in mostly

1145
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,579
the organization that I got to work with

1146
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,040
we start off with finding that have that

1147
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,200
they have one part one platform but then

1148
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,359
we very quickly find that they have like

1149
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,160
six or seven that are already there in

1150
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,560
the organization there's no real sdlc

1151
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,660
here which causes a lot of these issues

1152
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,900
and um you've also seen the overs top 10

1153
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,599
I encourage you to uh uh to to check us

1154
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,280
out online there's a lot of other

1155
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,740
information and we're also always

1156
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,200
looking for for collaborators I'll leave

1157

1158
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,160
are kind of the opportunities

1159
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,560
uh because this is a new space there's a

1160
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,180
lot of opportunity for evangelism

1161
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,160
there's another we see organizations

1162
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,140
that are kind of uh creating security

1163
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,480
Frameworks or trying to trying to figure

1164
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,079
out how does sdlc walk uh follow code no

1165

1166
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,040
of opportunity here to to create those

1167

approved business use cases with with

1168

users and kind of guide business users

1169
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,300
in the right direction and the last

1170
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,040
thing that I said I'll say here is that

1171
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,500
even though this seems like a giant risk

1172
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,319
from us for us for a security as a

1173
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,359
Security Professionals this is also a

1174
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,760
giant opportunity security awareness has

1175
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,560
always been difficult in getting the

1176
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,200
business to buy into security has always

1177
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,680
been difficult but now business users

1178
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,780
need us right they need us to guide them

1179
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,700
in the right direction and if we'll be

1180
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,160
there with them in this journey there

1181
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,680
will be it will be much easier for us to

1182
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,980
kind of uh to get their buying in return

1183
