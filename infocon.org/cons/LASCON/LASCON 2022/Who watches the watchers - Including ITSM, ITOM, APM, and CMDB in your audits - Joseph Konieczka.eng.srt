1
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,080
foreign

2
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,899
thanks everyone for uh being here and

3
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,399
this is the lunch hour they've already

4
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,500
started moving the food out there so

5
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,199
mine is more of a humorous informational

6
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,060
hey wait a minute I didn't think about

7
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,340
that kind of talk so we're not going

8
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,680
deep dive into code so I should be able

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,340
to get you out at 11 30 11 35 that's my

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,799
goal because you need to have time to

11
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,960
eat take a bio break and figure out

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,400
where the next room is

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,180
all right so we're going through and

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,600
looking at how you can leverage more of

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,640
the service management tools I'm just

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,799
going to take off that guy so you're

17
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,500
going to notice me a walk just a little

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,560
bit especially with the light there

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,159
this is an area where your audits tend

20
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,400
to not go as deep as they should in your

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,780
audits you're going to have oh yeah do

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,280
we have an incident management system

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,860
are we creating a ticket do we have

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,880
backups in place do we have events an

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,520
on-call list do you have run books but

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,920
that's typically all you have just that

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,240
check box and really going into deeper

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,780
areas so like I said you know this is a

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,080
complete vendor neutral talk all these

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,540
photos of our own if you want them or

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,580
want some different ones I can come up

32
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,980
with a million different ideas for

33
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,980
security or service Management on here I

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,080
am a life time member of a wasp since

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,560
early 2016. I'm going to be dealing with

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,140
a lot of os projects just behind the

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,900
scenes that provided input so all of

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,780
this is underneath the same Creative

39
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,080
Commons Library sorry license that they

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,920
have

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,980
key thing here all opinions expressed

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,440
are solely my own they don't represent

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,440
any former current or future Employers

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,140
in this or any other Universe in the

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,619
Multiverse

46
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,480
are you a builder a breaker or Defender

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,420
and I try to go through and create

48
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,420
things that upper management and the

49
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,239
business will be able to adopt and

50
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,640
understand it's been a while you know

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,300
but Mr T is still out there

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,099
and you know just about everybody their

53
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,400
kids no on the patronum in there and

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,159
then from Lego Movie there's Emmett as

55
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,980
the typical Builder or are you just

56
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,120
exhausted from doing it all

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,099
all right when it comes to observability

58
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,319
systems management there's not just a

59
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,879
single tool set

60
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,180
instead you typically have a multitude

61
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,060
and you probably aren't aware of all the

62
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,620
ones that are out there there's going to

63
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,840
be cron jobs Windows task schedulers

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,459
there's going to be SQL stored

65
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,560
procedures and maintenance jobs there's

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,299
going to be something that the sad man

67
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,780
runs themselves might be automated it

68
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,480
might be on just a manual basis they do

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,519
it daily they do it at the end of the

70
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,379
week or it could be the business unit

71
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,140
that's saying all right how well is my

72
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,860
application performing here each one of

73
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,840
these tools and scripts and checks

74
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
provides key information for mapping out

75
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
your environment

76
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,780
your CMD uh you know they always say we

77
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,699
want to have all our configuration items

78
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,000
our assets everything inventoried and

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,680
all of it should be tracked and

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,180
monitored

81
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,560
you're never going to have a complete

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,740
cmdb configuration management database

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,960
just you know try your hardest to get

84
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,100
there but the key thing in here you will

85
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,740
typically have your critical assets

86
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,199
and their relationships so you'll have

87
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,699
your business service maybe it's

88
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,800
e-commerce you'll have your Frontier

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,660
your web app you'll have your middle

90
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,580
tier you might have a Mainframe

91
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,220
connection you'll probably have some

92
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,560
databases back behind the scenes your

93
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,620
network gear if I can get access to the

94
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,000
cmdb

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,639
and look at these relationships even

96
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,960
read only

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
I don't have to run a lot of mapping

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,000
tools on your environment and if it's a

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
SAS vendor you're never going to know

100
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,100
really that I've already mapped out your

101
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,160
environment that oh what's critical

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,100
what's not and building upon that will

103
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,400
be the next set of slides here so the

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,500
attackers can see everything in your

105
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,780
environment if they get access to your

106
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,960
cmdb they're going to have the time to

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,259
go through and run those queries for all

108
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,160
of those you know obsolete systems or

109
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,280
you know it doesn't really get mapped

110
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,440
from here to here but they're going to

111
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,800
have the time to interpret the data that

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,680
does exist fill in the gaps to create

113
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,440
that map and that's why I've got all of

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,419
the Pirates looking in the same

115
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,300
direction whereas the admins are just

116
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,639
looking every which way which is very

117
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
typical you might have an understanding

118
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,940
just of your piece of the cmdb or your

119
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,280
piece or the services but you don't have

120
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,320
that holistic View

121
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,720
ah

122
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,060
regardless of which type of tool you're

123
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,639
using whether it's a discovery tool

124
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,740
where it's going through and saying

125
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,680
which databases which components exist

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,039
there so what are all of the version

127
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,100
numbers what are the dependencies on

128
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,620
there not just log for Shell but it's

129
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,780
going to actually break down and say all

130
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,360
right here's this vendors tool here are

131
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
all the components here are the version

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
numbers that it's reporting it might be

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,960
getting it from interrogating the

134
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,720
application live or it could be looking

135
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,900
at a lot of the informational

136
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,340
configuration files that that

137
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,759
application might have so looking at all

138
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,259
of those it's either going to be that

139
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,000
remote SSH or still SNMP you know

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,100
Powershell regardless these days a lot

141
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,340
of python but there are still a lot of

142
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,460
Agents on your systems

143
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,000
and those agents typically run uh

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,160
privileged so in your audits you

145
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,600
probably have a list of your service

146
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,139
accounts and your service accounts

147
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,520
probably in most environments are going

148
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,940
to say do not expire or expire after 90

149
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,199
days

150
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,280
going back to 2003 that was still the

151
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,740
case so I had to Cobble together some

152
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,280
batch files some Pearl and some shell

153
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,139
scripts to go through and actually

154
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,660
change those service accounts so I did

155
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,880
it on a rolling basis where I had my

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,639
original and then I had my new so I

157
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,380
would start going through application by

158
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,080
application switching them over so that

159
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,060
I didn't have an outage and by the end

160
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,460
of that cycle I now had everything on

161
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,979
the new and I disabled the old and

162
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,440
that's the only way that I could do the

163
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,900
password changes and maintenance because

164
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,080
you typically have to do it not only on

165
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,880
active directory or the Opera the

166
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,800
operating system but you've got to do it

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
inside of the application most of those

168
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,520
are going to be a binary manual big file

169
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,800
or these days it's going to be maybe

170
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,060
some of the front end GUI where it goes

171
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,259
through and you can do that

172
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,759
configuration

173
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,280
foreign

174
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,460
automation processes I also see this as

175
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,099
a big gap in some of the audits it's not

176
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,680
just your CI CD pipeline yeah just

177
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,219
standard one in there

178
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,958
your workload automation batch schedule

179
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,979
going back to the days of the Mainframe

180
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,260
essentially you had file transfers you

181
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,300
would have extract transform and load

182
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,300
jobs so to go through and pull in that

183
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,540
information

184
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,760
the reason why these are so important

185
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,240
is most of these tools

186
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,180
even from an event perspective from this

187
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,880
from that operating system from the

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,220
application performance side are not

189
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,959
generating those events

190
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
so it's not showing you when those jobs

191
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,779
have failed or when there's problems

192
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,880
there's still a lot of times still

193
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
sending out emails

194
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,220
but these systems typically are going to

195
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,399
have privileges across the board they're

196
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,019
going to have access to those privileged

197
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,760
file systems

198
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,120
and shares where your partners your

199
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,920
customers your vendors your internal

200
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,100
people are already placing the files

201
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,019
they're going to have access to the

202
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,980
databases your Erp system anything you

203
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,600
might have with HR

204
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,940
and because each one of those

205
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,279
components are across the board this is

206
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,399
where some of the most privileged

207
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,920
operations can happen

208
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,220
and even in Sam and dsam so the standard

209
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,680
owas Flagship projects

210
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,480
they're not talking about batch

211
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,140
scheduling in the context of security if

212
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,959
you gave me access to your batch

213
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,019
scheduler even read only I could do a

214
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,680
lot of mapping but once I get some read

215
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,660
write permissions to it

216
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,720
I can do the data exfiltration I can

217
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,660
figure out where those databases are the

218
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,399
queries the data that you really

219
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,279
consider important and because that

220
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,220
process is already in place for the ETL

221
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,820
and the file transfer odds are you're

222
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,519
not going to detect the activity

223
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,279
as a nom anomalies

224
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,100
so you're going to just see it as oh

225
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,339
okay this is just normal operations or

226
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,260
especially if they're doing a version

227
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,940
change and they're having to run

228
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,779
multiple uh examples and versions of

229
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,760
those jobs oh well that additional

230
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,440
Network traffic and moving back and

231
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,420
forth that's just some of the the

232
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,160
testing that we're going on and doing

233
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,579
with some of our new CIS admins

234
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,459
yeah

235
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,899
here's just the generic slide one of the

236
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,560
few that doesn't have my photos on it

237
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,220
if you haven't been in the monitoring

238
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,980
and management space

239
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,980
and I've gone back to the late 90s when

240
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,680
it was just your basic availability

241
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,760
capacity performance your old school CPU

242
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,899
memory uh disk space

243
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,240
yep yep

244
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,660
yep and the CPU run queue okay well Unix

245
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,300
box it's running all right well you know

246
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,180
is there anything in the Run queue or is

247
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,279
that memory and CPU really working well

248
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,079
compared to Windows if it was getting

249
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,380
too tight yeah so you're always going to

250
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,500
have that these days most of the

251
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,399
companies switched over to agentless for

252
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,459
that part but getting the detailed

253
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,519
information about the log files all

254
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,160
those process and the stack traces

255
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,019
that's where you're going to have the

256
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,899
agents on there your log file monitoring

257
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,779
you can do that remotely but it's so

258
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,079
much quicker and easier just to have the

259
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,480
initial part done on that operating

260
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,339
system especially if you need to do some

261
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,560
correlation in real time you still want

262
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,160
to feed it over to your Consolidated

263
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
logging analysis tool

264
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,820
in time instrumentation now back 10

265
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,040
years ago you probably had never heard

266
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,940
rasp you might have heard of APM but all

267
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,399
the the rasp is doing the same kind of

268
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,940
byte code instrumentation that the

269
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,980
performance monitoring APM the

270
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,260
application Performance Management so

271
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,959
they have actually an agent that would

272
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,839
hook in you know maybe some a jar file

273
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,300
with the options in there or some.net

274
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,660
CLR so it's going to go through it's

275
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,079
actually going to put a hook inside the

276
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,519
live runtime of that application it

277
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,839
could add some latency and some

278
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,399
additional

279
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,899
milliseconds to it and if it's not tuned

280
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,420
correctly it could completely crash that

281
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,079
application so that's another

282
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,540
Avenue for denial of service you might

283
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,700
not have thought about if I can go

284
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,860
through and improperly configure your

285
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,459
APM tools or go through and say Here's

286
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,100
the exact Java classes that I want to

287
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,000
monitor you know it's not going to be

288
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,440
having to wait around for some of those

289
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,260
zero days it's rather they're going

290
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,480
through analyzing your code your stack

291
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,079
traces just to kind of say okay we're

292
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
going to keep that on our radar and if

293
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
anything ever gets flagged then we're

294
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,980
going to kick it up now otel you know

295
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,320
with your metrics events logs and traces

296
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,200
melt probably already have it there you

297
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,880
have to have that synthetic monitoring

298
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,860
so that's going to be Puppeteer selenium

299
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,860
headless browsers python additional

300
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,940
things

301
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,760
JavaScript injection

302
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,500
I'll come into this a little bit more

303
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,560
but for your session metrics there tend

304
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,540
to be things that your performance team

305
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,899
wants to see your business team and then

306
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,940
a whole nother set of metrics that

307
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,540
marketing wants to see yeah like I said

308
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,000
your your runtime instrumentation it's

309
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,940
going to be inside there and you know

310
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,860
you're going to be able to get a glimpse

311
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,680
into what's actually happened

312
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,180
hopefully some of these slides resonate

313
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,220
not just with you you could go through

314
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,899
and explain it to others out there now

315
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,320
right here at the butt and then I've got

316
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,360
all of these different ones so this

317
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
represents what would be the synthetic

318
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,779
end user experience so you'll typically

319
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,240
have that range so all the way from

320
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,440
excited and happy to scared so this is

321
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,199
something that your performance team is

322
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,699
going to be looking at time and time

323
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,779
again

324
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,980
it

325
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,480
you incite as to how much your web

326
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
applications might be under attack

327
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,600
so if the user experience starts to drop

328
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,680
down

329
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,600
and you're starting to see some of those

330
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,880
performance issues you need to be

331
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,720
pulling in those metrics into your

332
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,579
system to ingest it and then do

333
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,320
correlation from the security side

334
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,199
there's a number of different ways you

335
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,940
can do all the ddoses and you all know

336
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,360
that now you know I did think it was a

337
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,339
little bit easier to stick in your mind

338
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,800
with the JavaScript injection with the

339
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,480
coffee mug and then the little Barista

340
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,940
not to mention the 100 Billet down at

341
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,300
the bottom uh JavaScript injection there

342
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,000
have been some recent news articles

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,560
about

344
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,459
um pii and the health information being

345
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,579
leaked because marketing wanted to put

346
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,699
some additional analytics in there so by

347
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,740
having the JavaScript injection it's

348
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,839
running on the client side and they're

349
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,459
going to be able to see all right what

350
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:21,240
was the business journey of this user so

351
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,339
did they do the login did they go here

352
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,680
did they abandon the cart they go

353
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,579
further what was happening with an A B

354
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,540
matching but if you're not aware of what

355
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,040
your marketing teams and your business

356
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,019
teams are going to be are what they're

357
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,100
doing

358
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,759
it's going to surprise you I have had to

359
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,880
go through and put a project completely

360
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,980
on hold

361
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,720
when I was asked to be brought in do

362
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,060
some monitoring on there go wait a

363
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,959
minute

364
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,139
um you're leaking pii here you got

365
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,660
account information

366
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,639
did the customer ever bring on their

367
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,259
security team

368
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,859
no they they didn't so I had to escalate

369
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,260
it up to my security team then they got

370
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,059
the customers and once the customer

371
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,480
security team they had no idea that

372
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,660
marketing had even purchased the product

373
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,559
so that might be a location there for

374
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,859
I'm talking to procure we all know that

375
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,359
we need to have

376
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,179
especially for our Cloud resources to

377
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,900
know whether it's

378
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,200
QA or production now so you need to have

379
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,840
those tags but the more tags you have

380
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,140
the more you need to monitor those not

381
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,600
just for traversing your network but for

382
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,419
capacity planning so if something goes

383
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,260
through and changes your scaling up or

384
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,320
you're scaling down uh parameters based

385
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,520
on those tabs and some of the cloud

386
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,260
provided combination this could be

387
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,360
another area where there costing you

388
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,660
more money or they're decreasing your

389
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,700
ability to serve your customers because

390
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,400
it might not always be about data

391
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,039
exfiltration they might just want to

392
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,280
 you financially so going back

393
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,100
and keeping track of those metrics is

394
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,900
very important

395
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,419
life cycle management you know this is

396
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,940
something you probably already have uh

397
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,179
in your audit systems but how well

398
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,820
tracking that you know as it goes from

399
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,559
the beginning all the way to the end of

400
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,780
maturity and then deciding it needs to

401
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,799
go

402
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,240
um

403
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,820
end of life your trouble ticketing

404
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,440
systems

405
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,299
another key area of useful information

406
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:47,280
if you have problems that are happening

407
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,179
again and again and again

408
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,520
then you know okay well you know that's

409
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,160
something we know that's happening and

410
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,919
how can we take advantage of that well

411
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,580
if we know those problems and know that

412
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,400
you should not add in additional

413
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,820
capacity after midnight

414
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,620
ah you know

415
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,919
and also do your operators during these

416
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,600
problems their run books are they

417
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
disabling the logging controls so they

418
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,039
can then go through and access the crown

419
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,179
jewels okay run books your run books

420
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,720
actually not only need to exist

421
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,299
but they need to be palatable and can be

422
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,179
understood by each one of the members of

423
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,799
your junior staff

424
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,919
are are they too monstrous to actually

425
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,919
use so you know hopefully getting a

426
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,960
little bit of uh Chuckles in there and

427
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,280
smiles

428
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,360
all right

429
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,179
your maintenance scheduling your down

430
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,480
time

431
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,900
no you have uh

432
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,360
you typically would turn off your event

433
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,480
monitoring so you don't get a flood of

434
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,320
event noise and you know another way to

435
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,240
say okay here's an opportunity to Target

436
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,640
your systems and you can't really go

437
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,820
back to that prior state

438
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,419
also are directly correlated to your

439
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,220
patching systems

440
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,360
patches can cause problems you know I

441
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,919
still remember way back in the day

442
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,520
Windows nt4 uh and you had your

443
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,860
slipstream First Service Pack three okay

444
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,900
if I can go through during that

445
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,760
maintenance window know when you're

446
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,500
going to be patching each one of your

447
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,620
environments the soonest I can get to

448
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,000
your pre-production

449
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,480
and mimic it being a problem that prior

450
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,539
patches have had like either crashing it

451
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,900
or disabling the logging or you know

452
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,880
okay well you know there's some memory

453
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,179
corruption here but yeah it's normal now

454
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,919
you still need to do the patching and

455
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,700
this is where all of the security audits

456
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,880
are going to have dsom and Sam will have

457
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,700
those in there but it's still something

458
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,080
to keep in mind

459
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,539
uh these days with all the smishing

460
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,880
hopefully you do have mfas

461
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,120
but if you can go through and get the

462
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,980
on-call list then you can make it look

463
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,039
more realistic and you can also go

464
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,480
through and send out an email from

465
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,840
a very similar but

466
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,640
vendor email address just with some

467
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,460
slight character changes so it might be

468
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,179
like support at company XYZ underscore

469
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,640
one two three okay and then they would

470
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,740
send out the email to you it's already

471
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,600
going to get flagged as an external

472
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,240
email which they're going to expect and

473
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,720
if they say okay please be aware that we

474
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,760
have the upcoming holidays want to make

475
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,840
sure that all of your on-call

476
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,059
um trees are already set up correctly

477
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,280
that you're reviewing all your incidents

478
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,039
and your change requests oh and here's

479
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,140
the link to go through and do that so

480
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,640
you know if they click on that link even

481
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,980
if they did have some MFA if you can

482
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,980
know exactly which ISP they might have

483
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,100
then if you have a bot in there you know

484
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,820
you might be able to capture

485
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,880
um that MFA request uh pretty

486
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,820
access to the incidents and change

487
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,900
requests and like especially if it's

488
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,059
around a holiday time or if you know

489
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,500
that some of the people are going to be

490
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,419
out on vacation because they're posting

491
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,340
on their social media

492
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,059
so you know that called

493
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:49,740
to get back

494
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,740
you'll notice this one Halloween and

495
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,880
crypt thing but I try and do that around

496
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,900
uh last Con on that side okay there are

497
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,539
a ton of API top

498
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,760
um there's one right after this so

499
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,080
that's another reason why I'm going to

500
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,240
make sure we end on time here okay it

501
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,520
could be that some of your internal

502
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,120
folks they're just going running their

503
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,280
jobs a little bit too often and it's

504
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,460
getting to that uh problematic stage or

505
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,960
they could be going through and

506
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,059
completely overwhelming it not to

507
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,900
mention all of the Bad actors out there

508
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,480
I can't tell you how many times that

509
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,179
you're monitoring teams are going to

510
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,659
have to run a rest API to get back the

511
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:40,520
information

512
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,039
the information that the vendor isn't

513
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,620
providing in the GUI or if they need to

514
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,039
make configuration backups or if the

515
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,940
vendor is only saving say eight days a

516
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,559
rolling eight day period of some of

517
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,760
those logs

518
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,080
you're going to have to use some of

519
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,919
those rest apis to get those backups

520
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,080
who is accessing those this is where

521
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,860
make sure that you're logging The Source

522
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,780
IP address and where they're coming from

523
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,659
what type of activities you know in this

524
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,760
case you know what kind of flavor of

525
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,600
pizza but it's not just that so here we

526
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,080
have the legitimate one and then we have

527
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,700
a malicious actor

528
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
so here we would need to make sure we're

529
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,520
logging that as well as the pizza side

530
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,500
of things okay

531
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,039
now dsom there are some D sum talks and

532
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,179
Sam

533
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,700
in the comp

534
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,380
make sure you take a look at that but

535
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,820
here's where we see the information

536
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,460
gathering now you've got the various

537
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,860
stages but you have your logging and

538
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,260
monitoring so all of these are going to

539
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,720
be your standard Incident Management

540
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,340
Systems

541
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,860
you do have your pii so that would be

542
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,460
related to your APM on there your

543
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,860
logging centralized application logging

544
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,620
your security then here's your different

545
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,600
application metrics as you get through

546
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,460
so looking at Sam are going to fill in a

547
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,460
lot of the gaps but there is no batch

548
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,940
scheduling listed here if the only thing

549
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,059
you take away from this talk is to look

550
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,940
into dsam and Sam and batch scheduling

551
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,940
then I've accomplished my purpose okay

552
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,820
so this is where

553
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,140
I

554
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,880
now

555
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,919
start going through what is this what is

556
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:38,880
this

557
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,360
is the so you need to be able to drill

558
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,059
down and figure out exactly what's

559
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,740
happening in your environment

560
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,299
and

561
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:55,559
sorry I was just looking forward to my

562
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,700
analog time check yep sorry you know in

563
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,500
a security conference you never want to

564
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,140
have all your Bluetooth uh capability

565
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,659
there so 11 27 is what I'm showing and

566
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,960
lunch starts at 11 30. so let me go

567
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,179
ahead and open up the floor for

568
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,179
questions or comments or even hecklers

569
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,620
okay

570
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,879
all right

571
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,779
are you already concentrating on food

572
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,820
and that's fine too it is actually out

573
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,679
there and I did see them uh delivering

574
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,080
that so I wanted to thank everyone

575
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,439
um oh

576
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,620
anything within dsom and Sam that you

577
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,179
think is missing

578
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:46,860
that should be included

579
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,620
yeah yeah

580
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,000
where would that go where would that go

581
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,700
it definitely needs to be in here

582
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,820
um but I would also

583
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,820
um

584
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,940
it would need to be added in a little

585
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,500
bit more here but this is where I do

586
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,080
need to work with the dsam and Sam

587
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,320
project leaders to figure out exactly

588
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,960
where it is I know that there's a gap

589
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
right now but trying to figure out the

590
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,900
best place to put it I I'm still trying

591
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,179
to figure that part out so the return

592
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,460
level two three okay that'll be the

593
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,299
first one okay

594
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,279
all right

595
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,880
anyone else

596
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:46,100
uh how big is your Lego collection

597
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,520
uh yeah that's on the top of my mind so

598
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,159
uh we have one more question yes

599
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,400
foreign

600
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,620
tips and techniques and cultural changes

601
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,600
all right so part of it is going to be

602
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
like

603
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,520
yep there you go there we go one more

604
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,220
okay so

605
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,080
and part of it is just information

606
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,740
you get overwhelmed by having to do

607
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,860
typing in all the CIS all right here's

608
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,440
my change request go over to the tab for

609
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,720
relationships all right I need to search

610
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,000
for This pre-prod Server This pre-prod

611
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,080
Server

612
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,720
and oh it's not yet it seemed to be so

613
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,840
part of it is

614
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,480
getting management to understand

615
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,419
that you have to have someone dedicated

616
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,760
really to service management and

617
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,179
Knowledge Management on there

618
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:02,760
ideally if you get really far along in

619
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,740
your service maturity you're going to

620
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,779
have the end to end problem management

621
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,020
Incident Management Service man change

622
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:16,500
manager so part of it is one you need to

623
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,440
help the assist admins

624
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,640
provide the information that they need

625
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,860
so what do they actually perform that

626
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,760
change

627
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,480
and what have the teams called them out

628
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,360
on before you know used to be oh the

629
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,200
network now oh it's the cloud now it

630
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,100
that is the hardest part

631
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,279
it's not an easy change just like trying

632
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,980
to educate developers on secure

633
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,159
practices and not do SQL injection human

634
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,679
rights Builder

635
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,059
I would you have to start off

636
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,460
so we look at your key assets that you

637
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,720
would not

638
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,080
and start working with those business

639
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,640
application teams to understand okay

640
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,880
what are the actual connections what

641
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,179
data is Flowing is even your operating

642
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,799
system teams

643
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:23,340
are unaware of a lot of the application

644
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,179
flows these days you know and I I can

645
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,880
definitely follow up and probably have a

646
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,500
two three hour conversation on there

647
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,399
anything else

648
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:39,960
for a comment on your answer

649
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,179
uh recently I just listened to the book

650
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,919
Investments unlimited it's like a

651
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,100
follow-up to the Phoenix project and

652
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,779
um and the Unicorn project and it

653
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,720
actually tackles this very uh uh very

654
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,299
Concept in story form so if you're

655
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,399
looking for six hours of listen that's

656
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,020
reasonably well produced it's an audio

657
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,000
book or you can buy it it's Investments

658
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,220
unlimited it's not by Gene Kim though

659
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,380
though it is produced by um I.T

660
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,520
Revolution

661
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,440
yeah I wasn't aware of that one because

662
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,200
I've got Phoenix project and actually uh

663
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,320
yeah definitely see and that's another

664
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,419
thing cross-pollination is really the

665
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,820
benefit of the conferences uh any other

666
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,880
questions before lunch

667
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,460
all right all right well go enjoy lunch

668
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,919
have a quick bio break and then uh
