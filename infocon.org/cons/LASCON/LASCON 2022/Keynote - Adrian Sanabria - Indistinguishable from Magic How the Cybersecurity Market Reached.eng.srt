1
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,080
foreign

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,850
[Music]

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,489
[Music]

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,520
[Music]

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,620
[Music]

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,480
more pointed than that it's it's I'm

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,460
going to focus here on some patterns

8
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,820
that I've noticed and uh and I have a

9
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,799
lot of recommendations yeah this isn't

10
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,260
going to be Doom and Gloom it's also

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,119
we're going to talk about vendors a bit

12
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,700
you know and uh I I worked for a vendor

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,380
so it's not going to be a vendor bashing

14
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,840
talk uh you know there's there's pros

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,939
and cons there definitely uh but yeah

16
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,220
let's get started

17
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,259
so as I mentioned I I do talk to high

18
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,939
school students a lot I do some

19
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,119
mentoring I I try to uh do as much as I

20
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:27,780
can

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,020
I um I'm one of the founders and

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,240
organizers of besides Knoxville which is

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,240
where I'm from from it's uh the only

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,100
game in town as far as cyber security

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,659
conference is there so it's a good time

26
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,420
everybody enjoys it uh we we get a good

27
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,439
crowd

28
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,200
and uh work for a company called tenshi

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,700
security where I'm head of product there

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,680
it's uh I've done a little bit of

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,720
everything in the industry I've been a

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,579
practitioner spent about 10 years on the

33
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,700
defender side I've been a consultant

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,820
done pen testing I was a PCI qsa I was

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,439
an industry analyst so I wrote about the

36
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,759
industry for a while I learned the

37
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,100
business side of the industry

38
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,000
um

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I founded a company it got Acquired and

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,979
last couple years I've been spending a

41
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,500
lot of time in the in the uh on the

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,260
vendor side but I also run a podcast

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,260
called Enterprise security weekly

44
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,440
and um I just realized I never actually

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,000
plugged in my laptop it'll go to sleep

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,239
again

47
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,560
got the stuff out but I didn't actually

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,920
plug it

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,920
and so between ions faculty for ions

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,319
where I get to answer

51
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,140
a lot of Enterprises questions every

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,099
week

53
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,379
and security weekly where we talk about

54
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,540
mergers and Acquisitions and funding and

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,800
stuff like that

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,099
I keep pretty in touch with the industry

57
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,019
and what's going on

58
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,140
so

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,420
so here's the retrospection bit you know

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,360
we I feel like we've we've done a lot of

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,459
good stuff like Security's come a long

62
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,819
way in you know 20 30 years you know I I

63
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,379
I feel comfortable saying 20 maybe 25

64
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,239
you know when we really identified as a

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,220
as a separate industry

66
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,680
and we got a lot of what we asked for

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,959
you know but clearly something is still

68
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,060
missing

69
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,480
so you know not not

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,239
um no I'm sorry those are

71
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,280
yeah losses from cyber crime so those

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,099
are direct losses not indirect losses

73
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,400
and that was from Rand

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,080
like I said really hard to find numbers

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,300
there's numbers like in the trillions

76
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,680
out there that I don't I don't really

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,860
think are accurate but suffice to say

78
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,019
you know we we've got uh two Trends here

79
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,080
two up and to the right Trends you know

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
the criminals are doing better the

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,840
vendors are doing better why aren't we

82
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,580
doing better and that's what this talk

83
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,940
is about

84
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,680
so

85
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,980
the reason I got into the industry is it

86
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,379
just all seemed like magic to me like

87
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,620
cyber security is just amazing like

88
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,299
you know when I started working with

89
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,400
computers you know I think my family got

90
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,379
our first computer in 1986 we got a

91
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,879
Tandy 1000

92
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,880
and just wrapping my brain around how

93
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,220
all the different pieces work together

94
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,800
you know like if you actually take apart

95
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,020
uh a three and a half floppy it's just

96
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,840
this cheap flimsy looking plastic disc

97
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,380
in there and somehow it's you know using

98
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,900
magnetism to store data on it like I've

99
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,000
got floppies in storage that data's

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,740
still good it's still there

101
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,600
you know it's it's just absolutely

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,699
amazing to me and that's just like one

103
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,380
small technology that makes these things

104
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,600
work uh when my parents bought me a

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
computer for for college I was more

106
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,300
interested in tearing apart the computer

107
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,199
uh learning everything I could

108
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,699
downloading everything I could because

109
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,860
of course that was I went from dial-up

110
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,000
modem to

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,180
uh 10 megabit ethernet you know direct

112
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,860
connection to the internet I just went

113
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,900
nuts with it you know everything I could

114
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,060
find I was installing uh everything

115
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,800
seemed like magic yeah I don't know

116
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,960
about your experiences why you got into

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,180
into it or security but I hear this

118
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,620
story often

119
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,720
you know that uh people got into it

120
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,680
because

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,479
you know that the impact of watching

122
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
your code compile and run for the first

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,020
time you know or the first time you got

124
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,600
SQL injection to work and you know you

125
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,280
pulled an entire database through a form

126
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,580
field on a website it's just like did

127
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,960
that just happen

128
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,240
was did I just do that did I make that

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
happen

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,180
it's uh you know it's kind of addictive

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,000
it's really cool

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,280
so

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,639
the other side of magic here is is more

134
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,960
of a

135
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,360
more of a negative side you know it's

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,940
it's the magic of you know kind of

137
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,560
trusting that all this stuff works you

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
know especially in an age where we're in

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,100
the cloud like one of the things I've

140
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,520
run into is on the vendor side I realize

141
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,919
there actually are limits in the cloud

142
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,680
like AWS has a page on it has this huge

143
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,860
list of uh hard limits that are factored

144
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,620
in and I think a lot of people don't run

145
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,720
into them uh but when you run into it

146
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,820
with a production product you know and

147
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,340
it breaks your product in you know kind

148
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,100
of a hard way you realize okay okay it's

149
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,860
not magic the there are computers behind

150
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,139
here there's limits you know you can't

151
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,620
just uh can't just scale forever

152
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,139
and

153
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,759
you know I think the problem we're kind

154
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,979
of running into now is we've got

155
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,780
different folks in the industry and this

156
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,280
is something that Robert talked about a

157
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,460
lot you know that have maybe a bit more

158
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,500
trust in some of the products some of

159
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,560
the services uh than those products and

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,180
services deserve

161
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,819
you know I feel like we need

162
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,100
we need more Skeptics you know we need

163
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
more people that kind of have that drive

164
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,840
uh and that's really kind of the core of

165
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,759
this talk is having that drive to figure

166
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,100
out okay I know this isn't Magic how

167
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,419
does it work

168
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,300
you know and it's it's been amazing to

169
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,319
me

170
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,620
uh and again good Bender good vendors

171
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,979
bad vendors uh it can be really hard to

172
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,539
pull out of them okay how does this work

173
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,979
yeah I know you're using machine

174
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,520
learning you know so let's let's talk um

175
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,639
you know what kind and and the you know

176
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,780
is it is it uh

177
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,319
you know what what are you running those

178
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,180
models on how do you update those models

179
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,520
you know what what is uh

180
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,080
you know where are you using it in the

181
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,880
product you know in a lot of cases you

182
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,680
see somebody saying that they're using

183
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,419
machine learning and it just makes no

184
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,039
sense for the product and sure they

185
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,139
found somewhere to to plug it in there

186
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,500
but buying these products we need to ask

187
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,060
these kinds of questions we need to

188
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,860
challenge a bit more

189
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,080
and uh and really dig in and understand

190
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,419
how that product is working because one

191
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,880
one of the things I I see is you know

192
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,979
these things get implemented uh wrong

193
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,780
because there's a misunderstanding of

194
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,240
what the product does how it works so

195
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,580
many cases somebody gets a product into

196
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,099
place and start using it and then think

197
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,740
oh okay that's what this does we

198
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,240
actually don't need that

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,340
you know now we have a a three-year

200
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,440
contract

201
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,379
so

202
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,139
so how do you know your products work

203
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,720
it seems like a silly statement to make

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,419
but again I see this over and over and

205
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,620
over when I go through breach

206
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,060
postmortems

207
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,800
turns out the products they had in place

208
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,419
weren't working they weren't plugged

209
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,039
into the right span Port so they didn't

210
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,080
see the attack you know they were

211
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,479
weren't configured right yeah I saw a

212
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,000
case where an EDR product was deployed

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,219
to 8 000 endpoints but nobody pushed a

214
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,600
policy to it so it was just sitting

215
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,600
there you know with nothing to do

216
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,760
foreign

217
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
how do you know your products work

218
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
seriously like what tests did you put

219
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,320
together to make sure you know yeah sure

220
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,120
it worked in the POC but now it's in

221
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,180
production is it working

222
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,920
did you make some kind of change to

223
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,839
production where one day it's working

224
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,120
one day it's not so maybe it's not

225
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,740
enough to check it once when you get it

226
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,160
there but continuously over time again

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,140
that's something that happens you know

228
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,760
Network changes mess things up

229
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,420
segmentations messes things up

230
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,099
how do you know your products work

231
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,540
so I'm going to go through a couple

232
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,260
examples here

233
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,820
how many people in this room have done

234
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,959
the Mentos fountain

235
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,260
uh it's already rainy out if you live

236
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,880
here you might as well

237
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,959
like the

238
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,120
just make sure you use Diet Coke

239
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,880
but the thing I love about this is the

240
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,320
first time you hear about it the first

241
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,839
time you see it you think nah that's

242
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,940
exaggerated they read something to make

243
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,100
that look way more dramatic than it than

244
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,480
it actually was

245
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,880
but if you've got five dollars any kid

246
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,560
with five dollars in your pocket can go

247
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,899
down to the gas station buy a two liter

248
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:04,800
of

249
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,399
Diet Coke you know and a uh and a pack

250
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,339
of Mentos and they can test this

251
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,140
you know they can test this product they

252
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,320
can test this effect and hopefully they

253
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,440
do it outside these kids that allegedly

254
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,839
go out to the

255
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,339
there are lots of videos online of

256
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,220
people sitting in a chair inside you

257
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,620
know oh yeah yeah and they get a face

258
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,560
full and uh and that chairs that that

259
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,239
chair is going outside to get hosed down

260
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,399
extremely easy so there are security

261
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,680
products that fit into this category

262
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,959
where there's really no excuse for not

263
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,240
testing it to make sure it works you

264
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,980
know it really is that easy you can

265
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,380
write a couple lines of python there's

266
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,180
even products in the industry that test

267
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,160
other products so they're breaching the

268
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,680
tax simulation space exists largely for

269
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,720
this purpose to make sure that all your

270
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,459
stuff is doing what it's supposed to be

271
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,720
doing

272
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,820
that it actually works

273
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,760
then the other side of this is

274
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,560
you know how do you how do you choose a

275
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,959
motor oil

276
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,060
you know how do you test if this works

277
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,079
or not

278
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,120
you know is is

279
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
Royal Purple really that much better you

280
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,459
know like am I getting the right kind

281
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,860
you know does it make a difference how

282
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,720
do you choose

283
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,120
uh either you use what your uncle told

284
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,200
you to

285
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,060
or what your mechanic said which is

286
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,980
probably the best out of these maybe

287
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,860
some advertisement caught your attention

288
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,040
maybe a friend of yours

289
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,620
you know we got um

290
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,660
dude with his uh Chevy Malibu here

291
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,700
over here he doesn't look terribly

292
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,040
trustworthy

293
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,339
but um it's it's not something you can

294
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,100
easily test you know oil sits in your

295
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,560
car for you know three months for eight

296
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,019
thousand miles five thousand miles Ten

297
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,420
Thousand Miles how frequently you change

298
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,160
it how big of an impact does that have

299
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,680
most of us don't have the resources to

300
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,240
test us and there are security

301
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,880
categories

302
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,640
uh security products that fit into both

303
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,200
of these categories some are easy to

304
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,820
test some are not

305
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,459
but either way we've got to find some

306
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,620
way to test them you know are we getting

307
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,360
any value out of these things you know I

308
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,760
I keep reading that the average uh

309
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,380
organization has something like 70

310
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,660
security products

311
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,839
I'd love to see the ratio of security

312
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,760
employees to security products because

313
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,860
there's a lot of overhead to manage all

314
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,240
those things

315
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,660
and maybe some of them do cool stuff but

316
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,000
it's it's really hard

317
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,220
to be effective with all 70 of those

318
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,500
products make sure that you're using all

319
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,180
the features that can help you out make

320
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,459
sure you have it configured correctly

321
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,899
you know make sure it's in the right

322
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,240
place and what I again what I find when

323
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,459
I go into companies is you'll have

324
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,899
somebody work for a place for two years

325
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,279
and not realize they own a product

326
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,480
we've got licenses for that I've been

327
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,760
paying out of my personal account

328
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,899
for

329
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,820
you know

330
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,700
uh trying to think of a product you just

331
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,860
whip out a credit card for and pay but

332
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,959
there are a lot of them now there are a

333
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,480
lot of like consumer based pricing you

334
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,440
know

335
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,680
pay monthly for it without a credit card

336
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,639
whether it's burp Suite or

337
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,839
multigo or

338
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,320
gray noise something like that

339
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
sure

340
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,720
easy to get up and up and working

341
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,519
so you gotta you gotta be able to test

342
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,899
that stuff

343
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,579
all right so the rest of the talk I'm

344
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,260
gonna break up into a couple of sections

345
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,019
here the evil evolution of infosec is

346
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,019
going to be uh

347
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,060
disappointingly short and you know from

348
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,180
my point of view uh but yeah I need to

349
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,459
build this foundation and work up to the

350
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,620
to the recommendations here

351
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,180
and there's going to be a lot of dogs

352
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,800
any dog lovers in here

353
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,100
dog haters

354
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,320
you notice if you ask for like people

355
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,360
are very open about hating cats but when

356
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,860
it comes to dog you don't you don't want

357
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,260
to tell an open room well especially not

358
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,940
after everybody put up their hand that

359
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,360
their dog loves but

360
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,040
people are very quick to say they hate

361
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
cats I don't know why that is

362
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,899
maybe because cats are you hate

363
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,160
cats

364
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,579
very nice

365
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,779
cats are

366
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,540
it's fair

367
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,180
all right so I I got what I consider my

368
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,839
first career job uh in Tech you know

369
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,459
this is before I got into security was

370
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,720
uh 2001 I had the the luck of living in

371
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,199
a town where one of the biggest uh

372
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,380
payment services in the globally I think

373
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,560
six largest payment company globally uh

374
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,380
was just right in my backyard so my

375
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,060
first job was a place where credit cards

376
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,360
were flying around everywhere

377
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,820
and we we had nothing we had one person

378
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,500
in the security department he was in the

379
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,860
security department because he screwed

380
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,019
up something royally and was Peter

381
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,660
principled you know failed his way up to

382
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,579
a security role

383
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,380
so they put him in security to get him

384
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,180
out of the way so he quit screwing up

385
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,500
things in I.T

386
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,779
and that's that's how we started with uh

387
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,399
you know I think a lot of organizations

388
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,480
started their security department

389
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,920
this guy's a pain in my butt let's just

390
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,500
let him do this new security thing and

391
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,199
we had nothing you know literally that's

392
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,440
it we we had firewall we had antivirus

393
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,740
we had uh Websense

394
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,500
because all the computers were you know

395
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,079
inside this crunchy exterior

396
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
you know so everybody was forced to uh

397
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,620
Microsoft Isa proxy and and Websense

398
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,040
where we we blocked categories

399
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,480
you know

400
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,060
I I was there the day that uh Websense

401
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,540
mistakenly blocked uh microsoft.com

402
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,399
all the updates stopped working that was

403
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,540
fun it was a fun day

404
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,459
um we had uh ISS internet scanner

405
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,680
anybody remember ISS

406
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,579
we had ISS uh ids's as well yep we were

407
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,579
a big uh idea uh ISS shop

408
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,259
and and that was it

409
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,940
you know none of the disks were

410
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,040
encrypted there were no host based

411
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,600
firewalls

412
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,860
there was

413
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,880
um

414
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,040
what else did we not have

415
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,920
I mean really really that's it

416
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,320
yeah there was uh it was one giant flat

417
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,660
Network open Windows File shares

418
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,639
everywhere people dumped

419
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,920
just whatever you know just everyone

420
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,480
full control

421
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,699
on a production share that would make

422
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,799
the whole company go down if you wiped

423
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,640
it and I I found that out the hard way

424
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,980
I decided to back up all my files I

425
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,140
wrote a robocopy script to back up all

426
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,299
my files to the iDrive which was mapped

427
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,599
to some benign file server somewhere

428
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,059
and come to find when I rebooted the

429
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,059
netlog on script uh remapped me to a

430
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,860
very important you know the iDrive was

431
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,299
actually a very important production

432
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,980
file share

433
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,919
and uh later that day it had all my

434
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,539
personal files on it

435
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,620
hahaha

436
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,500
and did not have all the files they

437
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,020
needed to update credit card terminals

438
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,740
yeah we restored that from backup but um

439
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,460
that's what it was like back in 2002.

440
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,960
and so 2010 PCI uh getting ahead of

441
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,780
myself I was there at that company when

442
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,600
PCI DSS 1.0 came out

443
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,780
and we we were compliant with like maybe

444
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,320
10 of it and that was a rough year I

445
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,820
mean people screaming at each other on

446
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,200
conference calls

447
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,140
uh we bought a Sim

448
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,820
you know and the first thing I did with

449
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,919
that Sim is I shoved every log we had

450
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,640
from anywhere into I had 1700 uh plus

451
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,919
devices reporting into that Sim 100

452
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,380
million events a day going into it

453
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,240
I was like yeah that's how you implement

454
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,440
a Sim

455
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,539
that's how you do it

456
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,900
we got everything in here it was like uh

457
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,940
we just had a major outage could you

458
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,440
like could you do some root cause

459
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,480
analysis for me since you've got all the

460
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,620
logs there

461
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,200
and that that was that was my life I

462
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,580
created accounts for him tried to train

463
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,900
them on how to use it nah you can do it

464
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,120
security rolled up to I.T

465
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,980
you know there's there wasn't much I

466
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,880
could say

467
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,780
so uh so yeah we were co-opted to do uh

468
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,640
I.T root cause analysis anytime anything

469
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,620
went down

470
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,900
and it was

471
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,539
two people's full-time job now to uh to

472
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,340
keep that Sim up and running

473
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,440
you know just keeping the uh the discs

474
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,539
from filling up every day something

475
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,280
stopped reporting into the Sim we'd have

476
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,020
to go investigate you know okay why why

477
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,520
are the Linux servers no longer

478
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,280
reporting in uh well we did this and

479
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,539
that and syslog.com got white whatever

480
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,679
okay put us back in your syslog.com

481
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,020
and um

482
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,660
so yeah that was a big moment

483
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,940
um even if you weren't

484
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,640
uh at a company that needed to be PCI

485
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,980
Compliant because all of a sudden these

486
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,539
prescriptive requirements in this

487
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,919
standard said

488
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,380
uh you gotta have all these products

489
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,080
the first version of PCI actually called

490
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,660
out tripwire by name and then the the

491
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,280
FTC didn't like that and they made them

492
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,700
either they have a sec I forget who made

493
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,799
them remove it and say file Integrity

494
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,799
monitoring you can't you can't choose a

495
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,460
winner

496
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,320
there you can't call out a specific

497
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,539
company that you have to go buy in this

498
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,160
standard

499
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
and

500
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,580
yeah I think

501
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,520
um a couple years later uh Josh Corman

502
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,980
called it the the Chosen Few or the you

503
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,720
know the chosen seven or eight there

504
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,520
were seven or eight categories basically

505
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,080
that PCI uh sent a lot of money over to

506
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,419
and uh those products did great the ones

507
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,000
that PCI didn't require you to get were

508
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
the products that would detect if

509
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,520
somebody was stealing credit card

510
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,600
numbers

511
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,640
there's if you look through PCI even

512
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,140
today there's nothing in there that's

513
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,460
going to tell you if somebody's stealing

514
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,080
credit card numbers there's no DLP in

515
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,820
there anywhere there's nothing that

516
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,520
would catch data infiltration

517
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,160
I I don't know maybe your IDs

518
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,820
I don't know

519
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:53,039
what's that

520
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,260
yeah yeah you got to rotate your pet I I

521
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,640
think they might even be changing that

522
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,520
since the the nist guidance on that has

523
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,320
has started to change

524
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,960
but um yeah they only updated every

525
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,940
three years or so I think the last

526
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,799
update took major update took five years

527
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,600
so

528
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,059
but um yeah for good or bad you know

529
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,440
there's people on both sides of the the

530
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,480
PCI thing you know it's better than

531
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,799
doing nothing

532
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
and that's that's one of the themes of

533
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,039
these talks here that's that's why

534
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,220
you've got 70 security products

535
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,100
You Know cover all your bases say you

536
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,299
know if something bad happens you can

537
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,940
say well we had a product there you kind

538
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,200
of got something to point to and say

539
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
well it's not my fault

540
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,299
like we we did some uh it's like vendor

541
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,980
management right we sent them a

542
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,840
questionnaire they said it was all cool

543
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
covers my back

544
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,780
I'm good

545
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,799
and so this is what we end up with today

546
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,600
so I tweet somebody somebody proudly

547
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,659
shared this a couple days ago in a tweet

548
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,880
and it took everything I had not to

549
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
reply

550
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,419
how is anybody going to succeed with

551
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,419
this

552
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:11,340
like we've been talking about how hard

553
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,960
Sim is

554
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,419
there's your classic Sim

555
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,340
this little tiny corner here

556
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,360
look that's the easy part then you gotta

557
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,640
do all this stuff

558
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,100
you gotta jump in here then these these

559
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,659
humans are just like

560
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,900
buried in all this stuff

561
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,840
on Microsoft threat intelligence 24 plus

562
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
trillion signals per day

563
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,520
you're gonna have so many alerts you're

564
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,280
gonna be so happy you're gonna love this

565
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,539
stuff

566
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,900
you're gonna have all the alerts

567
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,700
what about the falsehood we don't talk

568
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,500
about the false fathers uh yeah we're

569
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,919
going to talk about

570
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,100
before I worked at my current job

571
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,200
something I tried to build that didn't

572
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,539
work out because I realized I needed a

573
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,400
much bigger team than the company I was

574
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,500
working for had the money for to do it

575
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,080
properly was product testing

576
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,600
and and the straw that broke

577
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,179
I'm not a camel but that that uh that

578
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,440
really

579
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,580
that really ended it for me was xdr

580
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,919
and the idea was we're going to take

581
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,900
half a dozen to a dozen companies we're

582
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,100
going to actually put them in the lab

583
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,559
test them write up our experiences like

584
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,419
what's it like to deploy this stuff

585
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,059
what's it like to live with it how hard

586
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,679
is it to get it to a point where it's

587
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,260
creating value what does it mean to say

588
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,200
my xdr product has value is creating

589
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,340
value

590
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,280
you know how do we calculate that

591
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,600
yeah we've got to have some way of

592
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,039
calculating that right

593
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,580
because products can have negative value

594
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,380
we uh I had a CTO once who just really

595
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,000
had to have a breach detection product

596
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,159
if you remember these uh products where

597
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,200
they'd sell you an appliance

598
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,380
that automatically analyze malware you

599
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,880
remember these things

600
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
does anybody still use these

601
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,760
no no nobody

602
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,280
last line FireEye

603
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,799
they call them breach attaching products

604
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,380
a breach breach prevention products uh

605
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,900
you you could yeah malware sandboxes

606
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,360
sure you could have them in line or not

607
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,980
in line

608
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,460
and um yeah we quickly realized you know

609
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,900
spending a quarter million dollars on

610
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,280
one of these the only place we could

611
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,620
afford to put it was in the headquarters

612
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,600
but the headquarters was where we

613
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,179
already had the most protection you know

614
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,679
all our infections were happening in

615
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,299
these little sales offices the

616
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,580
manufacturing centers all these other

617
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,380
places we can put a quarter million

618
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,720
dollar Appliance in those places

619
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,020
you know and it we never had a true

620
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,520
positive with it

621
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,679
and every false positive support wanted

622
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,900
us to log into the thing

623
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,140
you know wrap up all the logs FTP it to

624
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,980
them

625
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,640
this is in 2012 we are ftping logs

626
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,340
to support so they could come back to us

627
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,740
and say Ed just just drop the hash of

628
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,700
that file in a white list

629
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,639
okay

630
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,659
a quarter million dollars on this and

631
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,000
now four hours of our time every time it

632
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,100
detects something which is a false

633
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,179
positive

634
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,120
so what is our labor cost for those four

635
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,020
hours

636
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,020
you know so we're way in a hole on this

637
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,860
product

638
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,960
this product has negative value it's

639
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,600
never caught anything useful for us

640
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,820
so how do you know your product is

641
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,418
creating value

642
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,200
all right we've already started

643
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,720
exploring some of the problems

644
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,240
and uh I thought this was uh pretty

645
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,840
succinct I thought I remembered somebody

646
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,500
saying this

647
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,440
uh and uh had to go back this was in in

648
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,860
2012. and yeah how do you know your

649
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,360
product is working how do you know your

650
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,399
product is is creating value

651
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,500
spot on

652
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,299
so when I say indistinguishable for

653
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:15,179
magic you know if it's not clear already

654
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,940
you know there are two sides to it you

655
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,380
know one is how do you know your

656
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,940
product's working it shouldn't be magic

657
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,520
you should understand at least at a

658
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,779
basic level how it's supposed to work

659
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,240
how it's supposed to stop attacks detect

660
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,580
attacks find assets whatever that

661
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,840
product does

662
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,580
uh but the other side of it is kind of

663
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,860
this cultural like

664
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,720
I don't know how many how many people

665
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
check things into repos these days that

666
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,360
are in this crowd but you know uh

667
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,360
LG TM does anybody know what lgtm stands

668
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,440
for

669
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,540
shout it out

670
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,120
[Laughter]

671
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,919
I mean they did a thorough code review

672
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,120
and they tested your code

673
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,100
are your bosses sitting in this room

674
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,840
what does it really mean

675
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,900
yeah thank you thank you

676
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,640
sometimes it's not

677
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,860
you know

678
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,500
I I I've done it a few times I I try not

679
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,600
to do I try and say something around

680
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,600
what I did before I rubber stamped it

681
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,159
and uh

682
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,200
and so yeah this is the this is the

683
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,100
thing

684
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,980
you know whether it's uh oil changes or

685
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,679
or Mentos you know it can be really hard

686
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,840
to do this it can be really hard to know

687
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,700
if the stuff that you've put in place is

688
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,440
actually doing something or not is

689
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,179
actually helping

690
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,419
foreign

691
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,760
again this is where where the magic

692
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,320
comes in you know what do you do when

693
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,760
something's not working

694
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,980
you need privileges for something

695
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,440
you start as broad as you can

696
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,419
and yeah Before You released a product

697
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,059
we'll we'll nail that down we'll reduce

698
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,700
those privileges right before we start

699
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,980
selling this to customers

700
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,600
we'll uh

701
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,980
we're not going to ask for everything

702
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,360
[Music]

703
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,820
it's easy to forget though

704
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,620
it's a understandable mistake

705
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,440
foreign

706
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,600
so yeah that's that's definitely a real

707
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,840
thing

708
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,900
and security vendors included in in here

709
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,700
you know some some of these products

710
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,880
that uh that really only need metadata

711
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,000
yeah yeah that access you gave them

712
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,039
they can see all the data they can grab

713
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,900
all your stuff

714
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,419
so

715
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:41,700
and to the industry's credit

716
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,279
I do know some uh some csos that push

717
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,260
back hard on that kind of stuff

718
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,640
they say you know what I'm not giving

719
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,980
you an API key at all I've already

720
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,600
created a role for you this is what

721
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
you're going to make do with and if it

722
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,679
breaks your product then fix your

723
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,059
product

724
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,918
so I have seen pushback on that

725
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,640
and uh

726
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,620
to put it another way

727
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,320
you know I think a lot of the a lot of

728
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,140
what we see in development uh reminds me

729
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,960
of of what they call wish cycling

730
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,020
anybody familiar with this term

731
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,600
see you know it looks plastic

732
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,820
two three four I don't know looks

733
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,500
plastic I'll just I'll just shove it in

734
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,919
there you know and and

735
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,140
it's when you hope

736
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,080
that uh your actions are Gonna Give You

737
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,639
full credit for what you're trying to do

738
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,880
yeah it doesn't

739
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,620
so this is often how I see security

740
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,539
products deployed

741
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,760
it's like yeah it's it's uh it's in

742
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,600
there

743
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,940
it's in there we turned it on uh we're

744
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,000
getting alerts uh there's one company I

745
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,980
worked with uh back with my startup

746
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,779
which one of the things we did is we

747
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,220
check to see if People's products are

748
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,539
working that's why I'm so passionate

749
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,860
about this topic

750
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,299
and

751
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,419
um they were scanning 14 websites and

752
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,100
they were getting results back so they

753
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,140
thought everything was fine I went in

754
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,419
there and checked and 13 to the 14

755
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:15,120
websites were missing the amazon.com

756
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,520
I don't know how that's possible

757
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,200
I don't think there's any way to copy

758
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
and paste and leave one character off

759
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,880
the end of 13 new lines

760
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,399
all right you know before the new line

761
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,460
but yeah 13 to the 14 were not getting

762
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,100
scanned but because one of them was they

763
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,899
were getting results back they thought

764
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,880
all 14 websites were getting scanned

765
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,100
with this desk scanner

766
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,799
so so yeah I mean that that's a kind of

767
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,260
stupid stuff that happens when people

768
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,539
deploy products and they're not checking

769
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,799
to make sure that all this stuff is

770
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,120
working it had been like that for eight

771
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,418
months

772
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,080
and so you know maybe we could make up

773
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,340
some terms here we could have wish

774
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,100
securing wish coding is is when you just

775
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,020
throw it over to QA you don't you don't

776
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,240
even run it you don't even test it you

777
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,380
just throw it over there you're wish

778
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,480
coding it's like I hope this works

779
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,720
and I see that all the time in in my

780
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,039
company even

781
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,899
yeah it happens

782
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,480
so let people get away with garbage and

783
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,539
it all ends up in in the garbage

784
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,480
so kind of a cultural thing you know

785
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,460
leadership thing you know you let people

786
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,500
get away with this for a little bit and

787
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,720
it's pervasive you know it gets worse

788
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:36,179
so I mentioned I I founded a company and

789
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,340
one of the things we did also the idea

790
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,500
was I felt like a lot of the services

791
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,899
out there you know like we're going to

792
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,059
do risk assessments and Pen tests I'm

793
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,740
not sure how much value companies were

794
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,899
getting out of those so we thought if we

795
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,520
were just going to start

796
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,760
from scratch and build a bunch of uh

797
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,100
Services what would we do

798
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,100
and um one of the things we found is

799
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,659
most people don't get a whole lot out of

800
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,700
a pen test you know most companies that

801
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,860
do badly on a pen test which were you

802
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,360
know we were serving the mid market so

803
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,640
it was all of them uh

804
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,679
they already know they've got issues you

805
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,880
know so there's one or two reasons they

806
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,159
want the pen test

807
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,960
they

808
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,000
I mean it's it's really just one issue

809
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,799
it's like I got to convince my boss that

810
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,840
that you know we've got some serious

811
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,580
problems here so yeah you know hit me I

812
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,020
need you to come in punch me in the face

813
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,620
you know I need him to see the black eye

814
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,580
and um so we found you know most people

815
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,559
you know again they just needed help

816
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,620
prioritizing what they needed to do and

817
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,380
you know tell me my dast is

818
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,659
misconfigured you know that you know

819
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:46,980
look through this stuff with me so

820
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,080
that's one of the services we do is we

821
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,120
just screen share and we go through the

822
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,500
configuration of all their products and

823
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,440
it was all misconfigured uh or at least

824
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
vast room for improvement

825
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,460
and then

826
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,419
um

827
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,000
you know so that's one and two and then

828
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,460
we also did a service that we designed

829
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,020
we could do the whole thing in 30

830
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,580
minutes or an hour sitting in a

831
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,320
conference room with someone but we just

832
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,419
emulated a lot of the stuff an attacker

833
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,460
would do most of it was automated we

834
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,460
download malware you know we emulate C2

835
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,740
you know what your basic you know like

836
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,320
SCI or some breach and attack simulation

837
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,899
product would do we just simulated a lot

838
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,480
of bad stuff you'd see

839
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,100
um and this is before ransomware and

840
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,620
extortion Crews got got really popular

841
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,500
uh and we give them a report and we give

842
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,299
them a score and say well you know this

843
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,799
is how good you are at detecting stuff

844
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,320
because we're serving the mid-market 100

845
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,080
of our customers had mssps

846
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,559
and we'd go from sneaky down to just

847
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,140
like like we'd hit the wannacry kill

848
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,519
switch

849
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,320
you know like

850
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,179
you shouldn't be missing this stuff we

851
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,799
grab icar

852
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,440
you know like we go as basic as you can

853
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,019
get and they're sitting in there in this

854
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,820
conference room waiting for their phone

855
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,019
to blow up

856
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,960
100 of the time none of those mssps

857
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,139
called

858
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,339
so yeah so that was um

859
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,659
that was a revelation

860
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,580
you know I don't know maybe their

861
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,080
devices were plugged into the wrong span

862
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,918
port

863
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,780
that that is a story I've heard more

864
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,918
than once

865
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,320
you know the mssp sends their Appliance

866
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,520
you plug it in

867
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,500
you know somebody didn't configure the

868
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,060
uh the traffic right

869
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,480
it's not actually seeing anything

870
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,679
so

871
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,139
so here this is more what Robert Hansen

872
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,599
what our snake talked about yesterday

873
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,339
where the glue missing here is is kind

874
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,780
of more of a security vision and

875
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,239
Leadership you know so we saw this a lot

876
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,040
and that's kind of the role that we

877
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,159
played you know when we were uh you know

878
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,719
we we would sell a subscription service

879
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,339
where they could use this for whatever

880
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,679
they could use us for incident response

881
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,599
but most of the time we are just

882
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,580
building a road map for them and

883
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,200
checking and making sure their desk

884
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,640
scanner was configured correctly or

885
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,200
their firewall was configured correctly

886
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,060
now that was catching this kind of stuff

887
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,060
you know and we build this feedback loop

888
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,680
okay we're testing we're still not

889
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,140
seeing alerts and it's more than just a

890
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,700
product seeing it you know what I call

891
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,980
functional testing you know there's a

892
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,400
practical aspect to it too where after

893
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,140
solarigay after solarwinds companies

894
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,820
came out of the Woodworks and say ah we

895
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,339
saw that we detected that

896
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,200
does it matter if nobody in your

897
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,780
organization saw it like sure their

898
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,760
product is pumping out alerts but what

899
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,859
percentage of those are getting seen

900
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,619
you know so a person has to see it

901
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,800
and have some way to respond to it in a

902
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,000
timely enough fashion to make a

903
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,380
difference right

904
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,480
you know so detecting attack is all well

905
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,359
and good but a person seeing it

906
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,400
and then having some kind of Playbook

907
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,440
that they can run hopefully somewhat

908
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,480
automated so they can quickly boot

909
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,280
somebody out of their environment you

910
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,619
know it's it's a lot and it takes a lot

911
00:35:58,619 --> 00:35:59,700
of

912
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,740
going through this feedback loop and

913
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,660
practicing you know I often talk about

914
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,280
it like it's a sport

915
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,040
like how often do you practice your

916
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,320
your IR how how often do you practice

917
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,540
kicking somebody out of your network

918
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,400
you know

919
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,740
you know I mean I mean

920
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,599
if you haven't practiced it it's

921
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,460
probably not going to go well right

922
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,160
they're still not psychologically safe

923
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,839
until they have a way to prevent it

924
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,400
otherwise it's just going to keep

925
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,560
happening again I can react today it'll

926
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,599
happen tomorrow I prevent

927
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,060
it I have time and space to react to the

928
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,980
next thing I believe you're referring to

929
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,980
the most skipped step of ir which is

930
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,560
the retrospective and measurement of

931
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,140
progress Lessons Learned

932
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,960
Lessons Learned yes if you can prevent

933
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,940
that thing that happened from happening

934
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,500
again you should be doing that

935
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,560
absolutely I agree

936
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,260
but um yeah one last thing there

937
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,859
I I see this a whole lot even still

938
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,220
where what's the security department uh

939
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,839
this is the Waf Lady this is the

940
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,240
firewall guide this is the EDR Guy this

941
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,859
is the Sim person

942
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,859
yeah we come to work

943
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:23,760
log into yeah I don't know qradar

944
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,480
or improve a click log out go home

945
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,400
that's security

946
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,000
is it

947
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,619
or is it busy work that some product is

948
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,180
created for you like like are you

949
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,280
improving how those products work are

950
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,740
you testing them to see if they're

951
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,200
they're creating value

952
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,240
or does it just create work for you to

953
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,419
do

954
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,720
so and this is going to be one of the

955
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,420
conclusions of the talk is you know

956
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,940
people need to no it's fine we can talk

957
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,000
you know there's no spoilers here

958
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,140
um

959
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,540
yeah you get you gotta hold your I mean

960
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,640
you really going to trust an mssp

961
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,460
without testing to see how good they are

962
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,220
I I mean it's got to be on the buyer

963
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,140
you know I don't think I can just stand

964
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,480
up here and yell about vendors needing

965
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,820
to be needing to do better you know the

966
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,099
people giving them money have to yell at

967
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,200
them for to do better that's the only

968
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,240
way that moves that's the only way you

969
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,800
move that deal

970
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,599
yeah so you're going to have a way of

971
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,680
testing it

972
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,780
and you gotta hold their feet to the

973
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,099
fire

974
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,780
say hey you're supposed to be catching

975
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,980
this stuff why aren't you catching it

976
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,160
um I don't know what oh that'll go away

977
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,380
I guess

978
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,020
but yeah so I I do a lot of

979
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,000
investigating breaches

980
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,920
you know because I this is something I

981
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,020
really want to understand you know what

982
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,240
failed in this company like I don't want

983
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,160
to know how the attacker initially got

984
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,220
in you know I mean yes that's important

985
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,460
but why weren't they detected why did

986
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,660
they get to the next step without

987
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,940
getting detected how did they find so

988
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,339
many credentials you know how did they

989
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,839
get through it so fast how did they

990
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,900
manage to push their their ransomware to

991
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,960
10 000 machines in a few hours you know

992
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,880
like I want to know all those details

993
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,440
you know I want to know the culture of

994
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,599
the company I want to know what was said

995
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,700
in those meetings you know and you don't

996
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,099
come across a lot of those details often

997
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,560
but in the case of Equifax you you did

998
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,440
the house subcommittee report dived into

999
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,720
all that they interviewed people you get

1000
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,500
a sense of the culture there uh you got

1001
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,720
detailed timeline of everything the

1002
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,579
company did and they did a lot of things

1003
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,940
right at Equifax like they had the

1004
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,900
Playbook

1005
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,640
you know when this stretch vulnerability

1006
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,040
came out they were on it they said this

1007
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,440
is something we need to address we need

1008
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,300
to see if we've got struts in our

1009
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,160
environment and it needs to be fixed in

1010
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,740
48 hours this email went out to 248

1011
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,260
people in Equifax like we're going to

1012
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,000
drop everything make sure this isn't an

1013
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,980
issue and so they did

1014
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,960
they dropped everything

1015
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,820
they used their SAS scanners they use

1016
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,740
their Dash scanners they scanned all the

1017
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,900
things and they're like what

1018
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,660
guess we don't have struts

1019
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,160
guess we're good and they stopped

1020
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,780
looking

1021
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,619
so

1022
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,420
you know that was the I don't know how

1023
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,220
you remember Equifax but after diving

1024
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,839
through that report which actually

1025
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,000
didn't come out until 18 months after

1026
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,940
the incident happened came out like late

1027
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,359
2018 I want to say December 2018. uh

1028
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,740
wasn't until then that we really

1029
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,920
understood you know how this failed

1030
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,680
and um

1031
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,920
I it wasn't that they were negligent to

1032
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,320
patch or slow to patch you know or

1033
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,320
underestimated their attackers they just

1034
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,540
didn't find the vulnerability in their

1035
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,280
environment they didn't have the skills

1036
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,300
to do that

1037
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,579
when they ran their SAS scanner they ran

1038
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,680
it on the machine that had struts on the

1039
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,480
machine that got hacked but they didn't

1040
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,500
use the recursive flag

1041
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,820
and they ran it a few directories up

1042
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,579
from the you know web INF directory that

1043
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,839
that jar file was sitting in

1044
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,440
they only scan the current directory

1045
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,140
I mean it's it's it's painful

1046
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,880
they put together

1047
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,220
the emerging threats team at Equifax put

1048
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,780
together a snort rule that would detect

1049
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,720
if somebody tried to attack struts and

1050
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,880
they handed it off to the Ops team and

1051
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,320
they deployed it

1052
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,460
neither team tested it it didn't work

1053
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,800
great initiative they had the Playbook

1054
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,020
they did a lot of the right things but

1055
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,839
they just they didn't train for this you

1056
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,460
know all those little things oh I should

1057
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,339
I should test my snort rule

1058
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,740
you know that didn't happen

1059
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,140
oh I should know how to use my my

1060
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,960
scanners my SAS and gas scanners like I

1061
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,420
should know you know what switches to

1062
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,820
use what ways we can fail at doing that

1063
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,640
you know it's just uh if the only time

1064
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,200
you're using some of these tools or

1065
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,000
doing some of these things is while the

1066
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,560
incident is happening it's not going to

1067
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,460
go well

1068
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,440
that's why we practice that's why sports

1069
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,540
teams have practice and they practice as

1070
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,520
a team and I think that's a really good

1071
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,380
analogy here

1072
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,980
you know you don't want to be uh

1073
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,020
doing all that for the first time live

1074
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,300
you know then having the Monopoly guy

1075
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,740
sit behind you and embarrass you in

1076
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,380
court or at the uh

1077
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,720
this isn't Court this is a

1078
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,500
the uh the hearings on the hill

1079
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,240
so yeah I found

1080
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,820
when you get those details

1081
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,820
uh they're actually quite a it's not one

1082
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,280
thing right those are 29 control

1083
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,900
failures the ones that are highlighted

1084
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,420
in Orange are are the ones that really

1085
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,560
hurt

1086
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,480
you know like like having clear text

1087
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,230
creds on a file share

1088
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,579
[Music]

1089
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,160
but yeah and then when we map all those

1090
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,720
out

1091
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,460
we find

1092
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,560
most of them are in the protect and

1093
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,480
detect comms here this is Sunil use

1094
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,020
cyber defense Matrix and

1095
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,660
all these are process failures none of

1096
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,280
their technology failed

1097
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,099
they actually how Equifax knew they were

1098
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:29,640
hacked is they had a TLS inspection

1099
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,220
product that they had allowed all the

1100
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,500
search to expire on

1101
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,060
and when they finally get around to

1102
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,700
updating those certs within 30 minutes

1103
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,920
they knew there was a problem

1104
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,560
they had the technology they had it they

1105
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,339
just

1106
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:46,560
for whatever reason you know I'm

1107
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,040
guessing it's political process you know

1108
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,040
they let this uh TLS inspection thing

1109
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,140
that was allowing their IDs to do useful

1110
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,000
work

1111
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,859
uh all the all the search expire for 18

1112
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:02,420
months they left it broken

1113
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,220
so very much a cultural thing that leads

1114
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,540
to that that's not something you can go

1115
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,339
out and buy a product to fix that's

1116
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:09,900
something you have to fix in your

1117
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,440
organization

1118
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,280
and then Equifax was a while ago so a

1119
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,900
more recent example

1120
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,359
uh from Uber

1121
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,200
and um very different issues here like

1122
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,180
this was less cultural and more

1123
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,000
architectural and and Design

1124
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,099
you know they you should definitely

1125
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:35,160
notice MFA bombing on any of your users

1126
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,740
uh you shouldn't have plaintex creds on

1127
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,599
file shares I'm guessing

1128
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,880
uh the creds in this case were probably

1129
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,339
in a net logon directory

1130
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:47,220
and uh just one of those things

1131
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,500
make sure somebody's got this security

1132
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,300
product on their laptop how do we make

1133
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,520
sure that uh we're gonna run the script

1134
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,280
at startup which requires us to put some

1135
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,440
credentials in the script then they use

1136
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,839
those credentials to get into the

1137
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:03,839
secrets manager product and that had the

1138
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,520
secrets to everything

1139
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,660
like everything everything

1140
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,900
like the bug Bounty program everything

1141
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,140
Microsoft 365.

1142
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,920
Duo everything

1143
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,060
so that was uh that was a lot shorter

1144
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,900
route for things to go bad there

1145
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,920
so the pattern here

1146
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,599
anybody notice a pattern here with these

1147
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,020
attacks

1148
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,720
yeah that's a good pattern

1149
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,640
how sophisticated are these attacks

1150
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,400
not very yeah we're not talking about

1151
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,839
zero days we're not talking about

1152
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,760
anything fancy here

1153
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,420
like this is stuff every

1154
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,079
basic pen test would find right

1155
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,420
and we're not hearing this kind of stuff

1156
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,460
here you know like

1157
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,319
all the latest trends and products and

1158
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,180
stuff like that you know wouldn't stop

1159
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,319
these things

1160
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:08,819
like I mentioned before these are all

1161
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:11,660
process failures

1162
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,960
and mentioning pen tests

1163
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,720
there's a funny thing here back in 2011

1164
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,240
harun Mir did a talk at four four con

1165
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,520
called pen testing considered harmful

1166
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,560
and basically what he was saying is

1167
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,540
your average pen test doesn't emulate

1168
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,359
the attackers very well

1169
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:33,240
you know back then that was true today

1170
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,420
every time I look at how an extortion

1171
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,280
crew gets to ransomware into an

1172
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,079
organization or pulls out their data or

1173
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,359
does whatever they need to do to extort

1174
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:46,200
money out of you it looks like the most

1175
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,940
basic like 2005 mediocre pen test

1176
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,680
when I look at that list of steps that

1177
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,880
they go through

1178
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,760
they're gonna fish you for creds or

1179
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,859
scrape creds from somewhere they're

1180
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,200
gonna land they're gonna Mimi cat some

1181
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,880
creds they're gonna get more creds

1182
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,359
they're going to expand laterally move

1183
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,920
and then you know the only thing that

1184
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,339
differs from that 2005 pen test is they

1185
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:14,220
put ransomware the exfiltrate data you

1186
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,619
know maybe that 2005 pen test was

1187
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,380
x-filling Data also

1188
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,140
but we practice for this for 20 years

1189
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,900
we've had those mediocre pen tests all

1190
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,540
of our organizations have and that's all

1191
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,819
that's happening now those same mediocre

1192
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:33,060
pen tests and we don't see anything

1193
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,400
so I mean that's on us a bit but

1194
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,740
apparently life is imitating art now and

1195
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,540
you know if you can call pen testing art

1196
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,859
and

1197
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,079
now the attacks we're seeing you know

1198
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,500
harude was right at the time but I I

1199
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,520
don't think any of us could have

1200
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,760
predicted that uh the 2005 pen test was

1201
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,180
the attack of the feature

1202
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,290
but sadly it is

1203
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,420
[Music]

1204
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,819
and now I think there's there's a good

1205
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:02,339
chance that there is a uh

1206
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,900
uh because in some of these cases

1207
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,540
they're hiring actual pen testers

1208
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,640
to do some of these attacks

1209
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,319
like when you're in Eastern Europe and

1210
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,599
you can't find a job you know job's a

1211
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,980
job right

1212
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,660
you know it's money coming in

1213
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,460
and in some cases I've heard of people

1214
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,579
being hired for pen tests that are

1215
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:22,800
actually extortion attacks

1216
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,200
so we find ourselves in the awkward

1217
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,079
position that uh you know there's some

1218
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,339
overlap between ceh ceh certification

1219
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,880
holders and uh cyber criminals

1220
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,980
so we've got certified ethical hackers

1221
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,540
doing ransomware

1222
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,980
Edition but um

1223
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,500
and get this uh

1224
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,960
turn off here

1225
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,340
all right

1226
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,579
[Music]

1227
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,359
so I think we've talked about most of

1228
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:01,500
this

1229
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,420
um I'll definitely share the slides so

1230
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,940
so you all can get this

1231
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,560
um I want to leave some time for

1232
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,560
questions here but uh

1233
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,079
but yeah there's and again a lot of it

1234
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,359
comes to uh I do say philosophies

1235
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,280
because I find a lot of security people

1236
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,380
wanna

1237
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,960
you know have this desire to cover

1238
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,359
everything you know to to deploy

1239
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:25,500
something when they get a new product

1240
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,420
they want it to be comprehensive you

1241
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,700
know we don't want to miss a laptop you

1242
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,319
know and I I think

1243
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,060
I think we got to come to terms with the

1244
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,260
fact that we're we're not going to be

1245
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,240
able to cover everything you know there

1246
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,500
there's got to be some good enough

1247
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,200
there's got to be some uh

1248
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,200
some risk management there you know

1249
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,060
you know hit the hit the systems we're

1250
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,640
most worried about first

1251
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,359
um

1252
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:51,420
too often I see the the solution come in

1253
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,280
before the problem has been analyzed and

1254
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,060
designed you know or design a solution

1255
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,079
for the problem

1256
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,240
so we need to do a lot more you know

1257
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,000
build versus buy again cases where

1258
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,200
people didn't know they owned a product

1259
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,060
they bought a competing product and now

1260
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,680
they had two of two products that did

1261
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,880
the same thing

1262
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,220
you know so I I think we need to spend a

1263
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,420
lot more time

1264
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,240
thinking about how to fix the problem

1265
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,160
you know can I can I address this with

1266
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,400
something I already own or you know do I

1267
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,619
have somebody on staff that can that can

1268
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,380
uh fix this for me

1269
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,920
so

1270
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,140
yeah and um yeah that's a whole nother

1271
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,760
talk security can't get it done alone

1272
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,960
where

1273
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,300
you know I I think uh

1274
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,920
this is more of

1275
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,200
the relationship of security to the rest

1276
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,900
of the organization you know where again

1277
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,619
you have that QA throw it over the wall

1278
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:49,740
uh way of thinking where security is

1279
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,000
never going to be big enough to find

1280
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,880
everything you know it's it's uh it

1281
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,119
really is everybody's job to some extent

1282
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,220
you know it's uh if you own an asset

1283
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,500
whether that's a code base or your

1284
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,599
assist admin and you own servers you've

1285
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,359
got to own security to some extent right

1286
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:07,800
you don't know you don't need to know

1287
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,380
how to reverse malware you know but you

1288
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,880
should understand the attacks that

1289
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,160
pertain to whatever it is you're an SME

1290
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,460
on whatever it is you own

1291
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,859
and then study failures like that's the

1292
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,540
biggest thing there are so many great

1293
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,500
reports of how Ransom Crews operate down

1294
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,140
to like here's the registry key that

1295
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,760
they use you know if you're not looking

1296
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,380
for those registry keys where they

1297
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,140
persist past reboots and stuff like that

1298
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,359
I I mean those reports are coming out

1299
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,500
weekly

1300
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,420
if you sign up to the risky business

1301
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,160
newsletter they have a whole section

1302
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,619
just for those reports that describe

1303
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:45,240
here's how you're going to get attacked

1304
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,220
here's what it's going to look like

1305
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,920
you know make sure you're gonna detect

1306
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,960
it when it happens to you the reports

1307
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,760
are out there people are pumping them

1308
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,680
out weekly

1309
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,540
and then process

1310
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,520
you know if you don't test this stuff

1311
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,280
it's just not going to happen

1312
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,280
um

1313
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,260
and then uh

1314
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,260
the rest here you know kind of uh again

1315
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,220
more procedural more more people

1316
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,859
you know so again this comes back to

1317
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,380
testing feedback loops you know know if

1318
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,260
your stuff works uh sleep well at night

1319
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,119
because you have tested that stuff you

1320
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:25,680
do have confidence in your people your

1321
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,960
processes your products you know you've

1322
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,000
set it up correctly you know you know

1323
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,520
you're using 95 of what a product can do

1324
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,859
before you're even looking at purchasing

1325
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:36,720
another product you know you've got to

1326
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,400
implement it well because you've tested

1327
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,559
it you know what it can do you know what

1328
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,660
it can't do

1329
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,599
and then um I found you know infosec

1330
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,579
really isn't that special there are a

1331
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:49,740
lot of Industries outside infosec like

1332
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,200
I've spent a lot of time reading about

1333
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,119
uh everything from

1334
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,240
how Maritime incidents happen user

1335
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,700
failure almost 100 of the time it's like

1336
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,980
like if you just followed the rules and

1337
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,660
stuck to your side of the shipping Lane

1338
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,940
this wouldn't have happened you wouldn't

1339
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,660
have blown up the city

1340
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:13,319
and um QA actually the you know it and

1341
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,200
QA is uh you know has had a lot of the

1342
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,240
same issues that we've had and they're a

1343
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,640
bit ahead of us uh great stuff there

1344
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,800
Elizabeth Hendrickson has some great

1345
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,839
papers there's a great paper from 2001

1346
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,960
called uh better testing worst quality

1347
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,440
highly recommend checking it out

1348
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,680
and operational excellence is is just

1349
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,780
again how you get that confidence how

1350
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,119
you know you're good to go that

1351
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,460
confidence comes from testing yourself

1352
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,839
practicing and testing

1353
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,359
and uh I didn't put Elizabeth

1354
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,700
Hendrickson's uh paper up here uh I

1355
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,740
probably should have if you missed

1356
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,359
Robert Hansen's talk when they get it up

1357
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,880
check it out it's uh I think a good

1358
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,920
companion to my talk here today

1359
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,420
uh

1360
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,280
Aaron Reinhardt Kelly shortridge's

1361
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,079
security chaos engineering book is a

1362
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:04,859
good one

1363
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:08,099
rugged devops handbook came out in 2015

1364
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:10,740
but really good under philosophy of what

1365
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,020
I'm talking about just as relevant today

1366
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,980
as it was back then

1367
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,599
and

1368
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,640
again it's I I don't know how we get

1369
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,319
this in our people I don't know how if

1370
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,119
we can create this or if we just have to

1371
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:26,760
hire people that naturally have that

1372
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,339
skepticism want to understand how things

1373
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:30,960
work

1374
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,420
um but again very old quotes very

1375
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,099
relevant today

1376
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:37,760
mm-hmm

1377
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,280
all right in conclusion

1378
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,859
there we will go to a trillion dollars

1379
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:48,780
in the security Market there's some

1380
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,579
really good products out there it's not

1381
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,559
going to help it's not it's not going to

1382
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,480
stop the attacks it's not going to stop

1383
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,760
people from getting in that that's the

1384
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,819
rest of us that have to do that

1385
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:03,599
I say us I'm a vendor

1386
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,880
but I'm advising people who you know who

1387
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,220
are moving in this direction

1388
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,140
um don't buy a product and then designed

1389
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,940
a solution designed a solution and maybe

1390
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,359
buy a product if that's what you need

1391
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,880
and feedback loops

1392
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,800
feedback loops in your feedback loops

1393
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,059
and then um yeah this is I'm mostly

1394
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:28,980
repeating myself here

1395
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,720
feedback loops

1396
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,919
I mentioned feedback loops

1397
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:38,420
all right

1398
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,059
sorry went a bit long but that's uh

1399
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:44,460
that's me that's it

1400
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,500
um I'm very active on Twitter you know

1401
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,000

1402
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,380

1403
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,420
um zawaba that that is a bit small it's

1404
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,940
s-a-w-a-b-a

1405
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,070
but that's me
