6
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,520
all right we're gonna do so we're gonna

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,480
have a little bit of fun we're gonna

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,739
actually keep this one simple we haven't

9
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,360
broken into well we have broken into

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,739
Lots but I'm not putting it up on the

11
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:02,760
screen this time we might be talking

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
about a few things

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,420
so this one is more

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,479
a little bit more about the

15
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,640
for those of you that know I moved out

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,400
of like the vendor space what six seven

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,860
six seven eight months ago and went back

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,860
into like the the well in this case

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,720
manufacturing high-tech crazy fund

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,520
manufacturing so it's been an

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,439
interesting change

22
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,180
but the other thing I like about it as

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,119
well is it's been a refreshing change

24
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,700
I'm refreshing for a lot of the reasons

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,080
that we're going to talk about before we

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,640
do that I'm going to let Charles

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,259
introduce himself

28
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,720
hello Charles Valentine

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,540
um so I'm I work at boom supersonic a

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,220
little story about how I got there I

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,799
actually retired uh last year uh and and

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,119
left indeed and decided I was going to

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,280
spend my time on a sailboat

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,920
um four weeks in I get a call and uh it

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,180
was from a person I know and she goes

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,979
give me five minutes and I said I don't

37
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,420
want a job and she goes just give me

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,399
five minutes I answer the phone and she

39
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,380
says supersonic

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,899
she's uh sorry carbon fiber supersonic

41
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,640
jets for 3D printed Parts she says it

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,960
really fast

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,399
and I'm like okay you got more than five

44
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,979
minutes uh and so that's three days

45
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,660
later I ended up working at boom and uh

46
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,220
in Denver so now I'm splitting my time

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,260
back and forth but I'm a father of four

48
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,680
like to teach people to sail uh I'm a

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
teacher overall that's that's how my

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,340
career has gone uh this is a picture up

51
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,599
there in the middle of me teaching my

52
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,340
son to put a new engine in his Subaru

53
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,739
which is the thing and uh and the next

54
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,959
one is me teaching my daughter how to uh

55
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,300
pick a lock uh Pro tip don't put a

56
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,980
picture of you teaching your children

57
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,480
how to pick a lock on Facebook people

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,780
don't appreciate it

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,620
laughs

60
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,840
and then ultimately I'm the donkey again

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,940
this is this is it works so that that uh

62
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,319
that picture was taken by one of the

63
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,420
dads at Philmont I'm a scout leader for

64
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,220
the past 18 years

65
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,900
um one of our Scouts twisted his ankle

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,180
couldn't carry his uh his 45 pound pack

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,400
so I strapped his 45 pound pack on the

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,220
back of my 65 pound pack and hiked about

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,780
20 miles that way

70
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,099
um and so that's that picture this is

71
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,019
this is what I do at work also like if

72
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,580
something needs to be done I jump in

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,560
roll up the sleeves and help get it done

74
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,480
so I'm just generally generally the

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,560
Donkey

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
a good one of that for those of you that

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,840
probably know me and this is the opening

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
one I'm also a boom supersonic I

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,000
actually report into Charles

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,659
I think my my journey in

81
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,280
pretty much have started in the basement

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,980
of the old house in the whiskey room

83
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,659
yeah and it totally did I mean it was

84
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,920
like yeah let's come over and talk and

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,420
you know standard standard conversation

86
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,819
whiskeys and supersonic carbon fiber

87
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,980
lawn darts how the hell can you say no

88
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,959
to that

89
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,940
so you can't I mean it's as simple as

90
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,739
that so it was one of those and for

91
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:44,819
those of you that follow I think on

92
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,400
LinkedIn it was probably February or

93
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
March time I put up I put a post out on

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,680
it I'm done I was done I'm still

95
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,180
obviously doing the hillbilly hit squad

96
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,959
stuff

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,640
way behind the scenes now because we've

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,959
got a couple of other folks running most

99
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,519
of that but it was I was done chasing

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,019
customers I was done chasing them for

101
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,819
payments I was done running a bunch of

102
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,080
those batching head against the right

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,420
wall obviously still researching crazy

104
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,680
things

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,480
um I was telling a couple of folks out

106
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,400
there I gave them a preview I'm out in

107
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,379
the middle of the I'm out in the Middle

108
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,459
East in

109
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,380
three weeks time yeah three weeks time I

110
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,120
think it is and the Middle East in three

111
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,738
weeks time and one of the crews coming

112
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:20,940
out as well and we were just talking

113
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,460
about some of the

114
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,259
they're allowing me to do a live hack on

115
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,960
stage and they put no constraints on it

116
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,120
either

117
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,880
so the first part of it is

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,100
uh for those of you that know like your

119
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,320
old history Lawrence of Arabia and back

120
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,979
from there camels are known as the ships

121
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,600
of the desert

122
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,360
and uh so I'm hacking camels

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,880
and camels have got RFID chips in them

124
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,500
they've got pedometers they've got all

125
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,479
sorts of fun databases and so I'm

126
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,639
swapping the camels with uh I think it's

127
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,680
it's His Lordships or the king or

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,540
whatever the hell he is over there

129
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,040
um I'm swapping his camels with a whole

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,300
bunch of camels in the middle of bug

131
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,400
Park nowhere in China

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
so that'll be fun

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,780
and because you've hacked the camels of

134
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,940
the desert you also have to hack you

135
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,500
know the other ships of the desert I

136
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,180
should say you also have to hack the

137
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,100
ships of the sea so there will be some

138
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,580
good tourists gratuitous screenshots and

139
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,100
live stuff with some of their really

140
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,680
nice prized possessions super tankers

141
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,320
which I've renamed I've got one of their

142
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,600
super tankers now plays Freddie Mercury

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
plays God Save the Queen on it

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
um I managed to get the audio file into

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,900
the middle of the engine room we'll

146
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,280
we'll just leave it like that it's kind

147
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,020
of fun

148
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,940
um I'm still the father to the two and

149
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,340
specifically the four-legged animals I

150
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,660
really wanted to bring Milo with me he

151
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,100
was with us yesterday when we broke into

152
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,720
one of the other buildings

153
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,759
geek tinkerer and obviously hacker so

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,759
yeah Mina mean nutshell

155
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,220
so

156
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,120
the first and the earlier point

157
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,280
why why this

158
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,979
um why boom why why look you're doing

159
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,860
this and for those of you that know me

160
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,419
um it's all about doing something

161
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,160
different it's all about change it's all

162
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,380
about trying to affect change

163
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,240
and for a number of years having stood

164
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
on the vendor side

165
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,720
going how do we change our approach

166
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,139
there how do we effectively communicate

167
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,600
with leadership Danny uh Danny and I are

168
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,759
starting up another podcast next week or

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,300
two and it's all about my bloody inbox

170
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,160
specifically the spam folder and so it's

171
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,560
like okay I can't affect change that way

172
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,139
from the outside can we affect change

173
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,940
from the inside

174
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,580
so rather than throwing rocks out let's

175
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,259
actually come inside and see if we can

176
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,699
affect change by the vendors that

177
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,160
approach us and so that was part of my

178
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,500
Logic for the other part of it again for

179
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,880
those of you know the history I might

180
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,900
have a little bit of a history in

181
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,039
airplanes

182
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,160
so being able to affect change that way

183
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
in other words rather than telling the

184
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
industry hey you've got problems and

185
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
you've got challenges why not show

186
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,020
people a better and a different way of

187
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,100
doing it

188
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,919
so the whole idea with the supersonic

189
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,120
Lawndale a little bit kind of

190
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,819
tongue-in-cheek but very much a way of

191
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,400
going rather than just saying something

192
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,340
let's prove it and let's show it

193
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,199
and I think that goes to a lot of us as

194
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,180
we go through our researchers and so we

195
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,660
do a lot of the stuff that we do

196
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,979
leading by just talking is nothing

197
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,319
leading by example and leading by

198
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,840
actually showing and demonstrating that

199
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,759
change is possible

200
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,919
and hanging out with Charles and being

201
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,020
able to do that is absolutely the reason

202
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,699
and the mission it's kind of cool it's

203
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:36,960
kind of fun

204
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,660
and I'm what six seven months in and I'm

205
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,460
still getting paid which is rather nice

206
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,979
A little paid last night I like looked

207
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,180
at the bank account like I got

208
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,020
money

209
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,900
they're still paying me

210
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,759
it's kind of fun so I mean that's that's

211
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,240
that's the logic for me for doing this

212
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,139
um

213
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,060
which means

214
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,759
a different approach

215
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,400
it means and again

216
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
it's tough

217
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
because having worked on the corporate

218
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,720
side in previous organizations and

219
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,960
having seen the silos and being part of

220
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
the silos

221
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,740
and unfortunately probably in some ways

222
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,419
being responsible for some of those

223
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,580
silos

224
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,639
the difference is now is again from

225
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,500
Charles's standpoint and from working

226
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,780
for him it's a very very different

227
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,160
approach

228
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,560
it isn't hey I've got my little way of

229
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,120
doing it and I'm going to impose it upon

230
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,820
you it's very much a case of how do we

231
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,679
do things

232
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,919
and not how do we rush in and do things

233
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,140
my first remit when I started a boom

234
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,120
Charles handed me 800 171 stuff

235
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
and was like here's where we're at and

236
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,459
I'm like great now I know traditionally

237
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,080
a lot of sea Sellers and a lot of

238
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,339
leaders would have gone straight out and

239
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,100
gone shopping for tours and Technology

240
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,839
we didn't do that

241
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,640
we took a step back and we were like

242
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,839
okay

243
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,940
what do we need to do

244
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,200
where are we what's being communicated

245
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,120
how has it been communicated

246
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,940
how do we basically observe

247
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,160
how do we orientate ourselves

248
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,279
not just as security people but how do

249
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,940
we do it with legal and compliance

250
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,160
and the people team

251
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,920
still bash my head on that one

252
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,339
how do we do it with these teams not to

253
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,980
these teams or against these teams but

254
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,440
with these teams you I mean you've done

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,060
an amazing thing there because when I

256
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,620
walked in my desk

257
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,680
I can literally reach across and poke

258
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,920
the guy that's leading the software team

259
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,880
I'm working inside the IT team

260
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,500
our engineering team are from here to

261
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,140
that first set of tables

262
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,959
and we talk

263
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,420
and we communicate

264
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,380
and it really is down to the people

265
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,320
so thoughts on that

266
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,779
when I first joined boom immediately

267
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,640
Engineers came to me that had a history

268
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,519
at at Lockheed Martin and other places

269
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,560
like that and told me what they didn't

270
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,480
want from security they and they told me

271
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,519
the stories the the security horror

272
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,040
stories from those places uh one of the

273
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,839
stories that they would tell is they had

274
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,640
a rule that if you weren't arm's length

275
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,800
to your laptop that it needed to be

276
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,080
locked uh there was one of the guys that

277
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,399
was telling me about it said I'm in my

278
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,560
Cube I kind of spin my chair around to

279
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,660
my file cabinet and I'm working through

280
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,279
my file cabinet trying to find something

281
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,920
for the project I'm working on I am just

282
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,260
outside arm's length uh one of the

283
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,880
internal Auditors comes by sees him

284
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,860
writes him up he gets a talking to you

285
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,440
by his manager in HR and has to explain

286
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,480
that and he's like I don't want to

287
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,000
support security and my immediate

288
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,560
response to him is like that's not how

289
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,240
we're going to do security we're going

290
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,860
to do it we're going to put Security in

291
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,660
place that makes things easier to use

292
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,820
better to use and works for us and we're

293
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,500
going to talk to you and listen and

294
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,420
that's been a big part of the boot up of

295
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,060
security at boom is to just make things

296
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,940
better day to day when we put in tools

297
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,560
like OCTA we put in passwordless

298
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Technologies we just make it easier to

299
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,019
log in so we're watching how many MFA

300
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,700
requests are we sending how often do we

301
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,200
need to do that and working on the

302
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,240
tuning to make sure we're not annoying

303
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,740
people even though we're putting more

304
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,140
Security in place

305
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,579
so I'm going to add on to that one

306
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,820
yesterday

307
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,140
well day before no day before yesterday

308
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,540
what are we on today Thursday Tuesday

309
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,220
Tuesday we um we officially launched the

310
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,200
awareness training program

311
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,940
now I say officially because about two

312
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,260
weeks before we'd unfortunately

313
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,880
accidentally launched the bloody thing

314
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,920
because we gotten the the training

315
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,660
program hooked up to octo and Octor was

316
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,220
like oh here I'm going to give you all

317
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,480
of the people and the awareness program

318
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,100
was like oh brilliant I'm going to tell

319
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,880
everybody about it

320
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,860
so we officially launched it on Tuesday

321
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,380
now we've done a previous lunch and

322
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,899
learned a couple of months beforehand

323
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,880
and one of the first questions we got

324
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,339
was are you going to send out phishing

325
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,720
emails

326
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,600
my answer was pretty blunt I think I

327
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,519
actually swore then and it was pretty

328
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,260
much so up

329
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,100
that's

330
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,560
why would I do everything in my power to

331
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,420
embarrass you

332
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,180
why would I try to trick you

333
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,579
why would I try to make you look like a

334
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,459
fool and me look like an

335
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,079
why the hell would I ever do that

336
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,600
especially why would I do that before

337
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,899
even giving you an opportunity to learn

338
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,040
and to train and to understand in a way

339
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,899
we'll talk about this minute in a way

340
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,300
that you're comfortable doing

341
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,399
why the hell would I set you up for

342
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,079
failure

343
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,880
and so there was a little bit of

344
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,079
skepticism

345
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,240
but over the last few months

346
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,019
I put mems out we've put fun things out

347
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,399
our CEO apparently asks about 10 people

348
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,740
a week if he could buy extra Apple gift

349
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,000
cards

350
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,740
typically they come in on text messages

351
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,139
occasionally comes in on email

352
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,880
you know the ones the anonymous text

353
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,399
messages hi have you got a moment this

354
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,540
is Blake

355
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,279
I'd love you to go buy me some gift

356
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,019
cards and PS can you rub off the number

357
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,519
and send them to me because I've got an

358
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,779
important client and I'm in a business

359
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,139
meeting

360
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,100
 happens people fall for it

361
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,260
otherwise they wouldn't do it so rather

362
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,940
than trick people

363
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,060
we make light of it make fun of it we

364
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,160
focus on the people

365
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,480
the other thing we're doing with the

366
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,800
training and the awareness training that

367
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,360
we're doing and I'm happy it's wider so

368
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,860
for those of you who know Gabrielle is a

369
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,800
good friend so it's wisest training

370
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,079
they break their training up into like a

371
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,579
minute and a half two two and a half

372
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,740
minute videos that's it

373
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,420
you don't have to sit through the same

374
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,800
thing you did last year and the year

375
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,240
before going I don't remember this

376
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,860
I remember it's going to look on YouTube

377
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,660
I'll look on Google yeah I know I need

378
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,779
to press here now that's it no

379
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,339
that doesn't work

380
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,260
and we do the monthly

381
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,360
a fun video but we're not only just

382
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,279
doing them for work

383
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,260
it's helping the kids

384
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,700
it's helping the parents the

385
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,620
grandparents the Guardians is helping

386
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,740
everybody around that person

387
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,440
and it's focusing on the human

388
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,060
now we're going to put the processes in

389
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,279
place I mean you yesterday we were

390
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,019
talking about processes

391
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,420
and I mean we were talking about for

392
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,880
those of you how many of you remember

393
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,680
this is going back into the gray hair

394
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,260
dates how many of you remember the Ten

395
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,540
Commandments of information so your

396
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,279
information technology that were built

397
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,500
like donkeys years ago

398
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,480
and they became the Ten Commandments of

399
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,699
information security then they became

400
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,820
the Ten Commandments of ethics

401
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,300
we're going to use those inside our

402
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,980
policies

403
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,620
because it's a human thing

404
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,920
it gets people think

405
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,560
thoughts on that

406
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,800
when I was at indeed we uh we decided to

407
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,779
buy an awareness platform and normally

408
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,579
for that it was it was about thirty

409
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:18,959
thousand dollars wasn't very much spent

410
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,579
for a company that makes billions in

411
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:21,779
Revenue

412
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:22,800
um and so we're kind of questioning

413
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,420
whether or not it makes sense to do an A

414
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,880
B test uh ultimately decided to do that

415
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
and so we ran two top vendors I won't

416
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,600
name them but you you would recognize

417
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,820
them and uh we got a hundred people

418
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,160
randomly from the uh the the HR

419
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,399
department and uh sent 50 to one sort of

420
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,959
training and 50 to the other online

421
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,240
training uh there was a pre-test and a

422
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,540
post-test everybody scored about 80s on

423
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,139
the pre-test one particular vendor the

424
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,260
post-test after they did the training

425
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,120
65s across the board

426
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,920
the other one they went up a little bit

427
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,959
and I learned something kind of

428
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,220
eye-opening like it wasn't very much

429
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,320
money wasn't a big deal but you can make

430
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,720
people worse if you too if you give them

431
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,820
the wrong training significantly worse

432
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,560
like for some reason they went through

433
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,760
that training and started questioning

434
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,980
the things that they already knew

435
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,079
um so highly encourage a b testing

436
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,120
highly encouraged like making sure that

437
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,740
your training is effective and getting

438
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,600
what you want

439
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,579
now the other part of this is it's not

440
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,920
just an internal conversation

441
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,139
this is where we start to look at our

442
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,220
partners

443
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,060
and our vendors and our suppliers and

444
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,680
our third parties and I don't want to

445
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,139
call them vendors and suppliers because

446
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,940
they are partners for two different

447
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,519
reasons we have the ones that are

448
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,019
helping to build

449
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,940
that lawn Dot

450
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,459
those are certainly partners and some of

451
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,779
them know a hell of a lot more than we

452
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,199
do so we learn from them just as much as

453
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,899
they're learning and working with us

454
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:53,880
that we have accountability

455
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,759
we have responsibilities we have

456
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,899
deadlines we have all sorts of

457
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,940
interesting stuff that comes out of it

458
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,259
but let me get to the information

459
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,020
security part of the world

460
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,179
and as we all know unfortunately in many

461
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,880
cases that accountability word doesn't

462
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,119
hold much weight

463
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,520
so the nice thing honestly about being

464
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,859
the ciso and the nice thing about being

465
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,540
in the position that a child has put me

466
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,319
in

467
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,900
is I get to ask the awkward questions to

468
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,480
the vendors and we get to choose

469
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,660
partners that we want to work with

470
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,340
so it's another one of those that we're

471
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,380
not going to go out and choose the tier

472
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,140
one or the tier two or even the tier 10.

473
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,299
because most of them unfortunately don't

474
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,940
stand behind what they do not as

475
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,679
effectively as we would want them to

476
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,500
this is where we're working in some

477
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,419
cases with smaller partners

478
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,860
we're working with folks who are a

479
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,080
little more dynamic who care and when

480
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,760
things go wrong and we have these

481
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
conversations up front

482
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,660
when things go wrong because they will

483
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,100
they always do

484
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,200
they're beside you

485
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,240
they're not playing the blame game just

486
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,919
the same as we don't

487
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,660
when goes wrong inside the

488
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,220
organization it's like

489
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,980
all hands on debt what do we need to do

490
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,919
how do we solve this

491
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,080
not well it's their fault or somebody

492
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,940
else's fault or it's the network team's

493
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,740
fault or whatever the hell it is it's

494
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,360
how do we

495
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,299
solve things so as we start looking at

496
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,799
partners and vendors that's what we're

497
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,120
looking for

498
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,220
we want somebody to come and go hey I

499
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,559
got you back I got you back when the

500
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,120
worst things happen I got you back when

501
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,500
it's good

502
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,559
on a golf outing an estate dinner isn't

503
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,780
going to fix that

504
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,000
so just one of those things that's kind

505
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,919
of a nice thing to do I'm going to add

506
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,059
to this one

507
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,480
which is very much of this

508
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,919
yeah

509
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,200
we laugh and we giggle

510
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,940
but you know what

511
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,140
we still buy the

512
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,419
why would we buy something from somebody

513
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,100
who's going to lie to us

514
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,020
why would we even let them in the front

515
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,220
freaking door

516
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,720
the way we change our environment

517
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,620
is by voting with our checkbooks where

518
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,760
are you going to put your money you're

519
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,620
going to put it back in somebody who

520
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,299
keeps telling you it's hack approved for

521
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:28,620
it's safe and secure or 100 guaranteed

522
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,260
the word protect I can protect you

523
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,900


524
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,520
you might be able to protect me from

525
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,380
everything you know today

526
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,640
tomorrow all bets are off

527
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,559
and so this is one of those things again

528
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,140
from an epics and a moral side of the

529
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,919
world

530
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,679
how do you choose who comes in that

531
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,140
front door how do you choose as an

532
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,679
organization what you're messaging

533
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
is going to be two csos and to

534
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,919
leadership and organizations how many of

535
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,780
you can honestly say that you've sat

536
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,880
down at a meeting and you've been

537
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,700
truthful and honest hey I got a pretty

538
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,280
good talk it's kind of good breaks every

539
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,200
now and again we're still working on a

540
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,340
whole bunch of the behind the

541
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,980
scenes like Ducks looks cool but

542
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,440
we're paddling like idiots behind it

543
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,360
but you know what we'll work with you on

544
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,160
it

545
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,220
I'd love that kind of a conversation

546
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,080
but I don't get it

547
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,780
hey our thing is quantum proof and safe

548
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,720
and AI particular and has Bells whistles

549
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,380
and is powered by unicorn farts

550
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,299
and it's better than everybody else's

551
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,299
and I've got people to prove it

552
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,700
so this is a big one to me I don't know

553
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,299
thoughts on that on any of that

554
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,799
I mean ultimately as security

555
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,140
practitioners we have to gain the

556
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,419
confidence and then trust of our

557
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,340
organization we want people when they

558
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,440
make a mistake to tell us and not be

559
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,020
scared that they're going to be punished

560
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,820
and I think this this has to be true for

561
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,740
our vendors also when a mistake is made

562
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,600
they have to tell us and so we can talk

563
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,760
about it and mitigate the risks I see

564
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,820
too many there's too much talk about

565
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,440
honestly hiding breaches we saw what was

566
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,960
going on with uh with Uber recently like

567
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,760
I think it's really important that we're

568
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,440
sharing what's actually going on with

569
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,179
each other and I'm encouraged to see

570
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,640
that happening more but I I think it

571
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,380
goes for the vendors and and internally

572
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,600
yeah absolutely and I think it's you

573
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
know to this point as well we're

574
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
beholdened

575
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,419
to an order committee to a board of

576
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,659
directors to a CFO and to an entire

577
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,520
organization that looks at us and goes

578
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,919
hey you told us this

579
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,480
and this is where it kind of gets

580
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,340
interesting as well I've got the effect

581
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,440
here the next slide

582
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,159
this is one that we need to be better on

583
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,380
uh for those of you that followed Danny

584
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,360
and I did the doctor dog web series for

585
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,980
a short period of time with the San

586
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,039
Francisco folks that's now ended but one

587
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,539
of the fun things that seem to get most

588
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,480
people like riled up in a good way

589
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,299
was we did the top 10.

590
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,760
and it was the top 10 things to ask your

591
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,059
mssp the top 10 things to ask anybody

592
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,580
that says they do Quantum or they do AI

593
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,919
the top things to ask your endpoint

594
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,720
vendor the top things to ask anybody

595
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,659
that's going to do a pen test for you

596
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,039
when we started put them together we

597
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,140
never finished it so

598
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,000
actually quick show of hands how many of

599
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,980
you here would be interested in seeing

600
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,500
those lists if I okay all right all

601
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,600
right everybody got it

602
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
hint taken will happen

603
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,100
so I'm either going to Chuck them up on

604
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,840
LinkedIn

605
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,700
um or I'll do them with Danny or I'll

606
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,159
figure a way of getting them out one by

607
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,140
one and then somehow or other we'll put

608
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,520
it in some place where everybody can

609
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,780
find the ready things

610
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,539
so because to me it all comes down it

611
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,640
behooves us

612
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,980
to also ask questions and to educate the

613
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,120
business

614
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,740
in what questions they should be asking

615
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,120
us it was a perfect conversation I

616
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,140
remember

617
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,179
so

618
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,520
I started what the hell did I start was

619
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,799
it March April whenever it was it's all

620
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,039
running together isn't it yeah I started

621
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,320
and it wasn't long after I started that

622
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,600
we had the first board meeting

623
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,580
and I I won't forget the question it was

624
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,900
like Hey can you protect you know you're

625
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,059
here to protect us I'm like no I'm not

626
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,600
and if we ever promise that fire me

627
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,640
and then the question then became one of

628
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,520
okay well what can we do how can we do

629
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,400
it how do we measure risk how do we

630
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,620
measure Effectiveness in this cyber

631
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,900
security framework it's idiot proof

632
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,720
literally idioproof and I love it it's

633
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,820
simple and it works but then the

634
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,320
questions became from the board which

635
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,020
were fantastic which is okay

636
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,900
how do we see progress

637
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,480
what are those key indicators that help

638
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,159
us understand what the hell are you

639
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,120
doing

640
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,640
and so we started to dig into it some of

641
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,380
it came down to awareness how do we

642
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,640
train our people

643
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,640
some of it came down to how what eyes do

644
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,860
we have on our own environment

645
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,380
how many of you hear that are either

646
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,059
responsible for your own organizations

647
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,059
or have clients responsible can put your

648
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,100
hand on your heart and say I know where

649
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,200
all of my assets are

650
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
yeah exactly none of them

651
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,460
and yet that's step one

652
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,280
information security 101 what do you

653
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,059
have where is it what's it doing and how

654
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,240
the Smeg do I try to protect it

655
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,100
if we don't know that we shouldn't be

656
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,740
doing anything else

657
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,380
if we haven't figured that out we

658
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,480
don't get to buy all the fancy toys we

659
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,159
don't get to go golfing or get steak

660
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,960
dinners we don't get to get what 200

661
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,080
when we pass go

662
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,880
yeah we've forgotten that

663
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,100
so this comes down to ask more questions

664
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,860
this comes down to the very very simple

665
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,840
basics

666
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,460
things that we need to remember and

667
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,840
again the nice thing about being on the

668
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,140
inside is as the Seesaw is I get to live

669
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,039
this

670
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,659
I get to say hey we're not going

671
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,340
shopping for any more toys because I

672
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,380
Gotta Have Eyes in my environment I need

673
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,539
to understand what the hell I've got

674
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:14,280
because if I can't understand what I've

675
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,679
got I can't go to the business and then

676
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,720
tell them how risky what we have is

677
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,059
especially where it is

678
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,159
and that's everything from systems but

679
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,159
more importantly data

680
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,080
we're building

681
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,539
a kind of interesting toy

682
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,880
really freaking interesting

683
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,380
which is fun

684
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,960
but the downside is our adversaries are

685
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,580
like oh that's cool can we steal the

686
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,200
ship it's easier that way why reinvent

687
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,220
the wheel when you can steal somebody

688
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,600
else's

689
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,720
so we have to be concerned by that

690
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,840
and so if I can't tell people where the

691
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,179
stuff is how the hell am I going to tell

692
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,400
them how risky it is let alone what

693
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,100
we're going to be able to do with it

694
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,080
simple

695
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,720
it doesn't get any more complicated than

696
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,480
that yet we make it more complicated

697
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,799
so strip the away

698
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,720
defaults

699
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,520
we've got a great board and audit

700
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,840
committee yeah

701
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,460
if you aren't talking with Senior

702
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,140
Management and Executives and and

703
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,120
explaining what's going on in business

704
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,760
terms do that start making your plan

705
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,100
start talking to your peers get in front

706
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,380
of them we this first meeting Chris was

707
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,480
just talking about was maybe five or ten

708
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,059
minutes of kind of a quick cyber update

709
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,220
it was the first one that we did at the

710
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,900
end of the meeting they said we want an

711
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,539
hour next time and so we prepared an

712
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,400
hour of content and had and it was about

713
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,200
30 minutes of content 30 minutes of

714
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
questions yeah

715
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,220
um had an absolutely amazing talk these

716
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,200
boards they know because the SEC is

717
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,880
starting to require that that they have

718
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,620
to get good at Cyber they have to

719
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,360
understand that risk and they're

720
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,940
inquisitive and interested and helping

721
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,039
us turn these conversations into

722
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,720
business terms

723
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,100
um one of the things that Chris did that

724
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,080
I thought was amazing is what you need

725
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,279
you need somebody looking at your

726
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,140
environment he wasn't calling it an mssp

727
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,440
he said we need 24x7 eyes we sleep

728
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,820
sometimes and don't know what's going on

729
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,320
we need somebody looking at things while

730
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,600
we're not there just changing the

731
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,039
comfort conversation a little bit into

732
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,480
what is the business outcome and not

733
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,860
what is the suite of tools that we need

734
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,380
to buy is an important first step in

735
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,000
those conversations to just make them go

736
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,640
well and I think to a large extent

737
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,840
that's that's happened we're getting

738
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,760
great feedback from the board and uh

739
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,320
we're being asked back which is always a

740
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,820
good time

741
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,559
yeah they even want me in there which is

742
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,779
scaring that it scares me I'm like have

743
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,039
I become too civilized

744
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,940
I think the next no because the next

745
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,799
one's I got a feeling I think I'm out of

746
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,000
country

747
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,620
I think I'm out of country which means

748
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,960
if I'm on the video I'm going into Saudi

749
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,700
Arabia with a bright pink beard by the

750
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,100
way just for shits and poodles actually

751
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,900
I'd love to put a rainbow bid but I

752
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,279
think I can just do one color because

753
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,200
it's simpler so it's going to be bright

754
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
pink just a heads up on that one so if

755
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,580
you don't hear from me from middle of

756
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,820
November onwards you know what

757
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,200
and I'm probably gonna be wearing The

758
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,659
Kilt as well just

759
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:07,260
um

760
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,600
if you're gonna do it you just gotta do

761
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,779
it

762
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,520
so let's talk about the humans

763
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,960
we've talked about it from the

764
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,820
standpoint but let's really focus in on

765
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,980
the humans

766
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,360
how

767
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,400
how do we do this how do we work with

768
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,179
them how do we put them first especially

769
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,400
when I've got 7 000 vendors telling me

770
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,039
that this solution can solve all my

771
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,480
problems and now we don't need to worry

772
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,640
about those people that much

773
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,880
how do we explain that to an Advisory

774
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,039
board or a board of directors how do we

775
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,960
explain that with CFO

776
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,179
how do we do it to an organization that

777
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,159
wants to be a little bit more corporate

778
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,279
but we know because let's face it we're

779
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,080
all social engineers

780
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,179
that a little bit of humor goes a hell

781
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,220
of a long way

782
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,299
how do we actually educate rather than

783
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,620
tell

784
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,200
it's a big big difference

785
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,179
and so these are the areas and these are

786
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,260
some of the things that we've been

787
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,539
trying to work our way through and some

788
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,279
of the logic for wanting to work our way

789
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,620
through them is this

790
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,559
these are 2022's numbers

791
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,320
we've got just over 5 billion people

792
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,240
online

793
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,220
out of a population of the globe What

794
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,520
7.89 or 7.98 whatever the hell it is

795
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,559
I'm I these slides I'll make sure these

796
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,880
are available I think a is being

797
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,380
recorded and B I'll get them out to

798
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,580
anybody that wants a copy of them and

799
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,779
see I'll probably put them up on

800
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,760
LinkedIn

801
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,340
if we take a standard bell curve because

802
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,840
we all know the standard belt curve

803
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,240
works not

804
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,059
round about and I'm being nice

805
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:49,500
round about 15 have an idea of security

806
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm trying to be nice I'm trying to be

807
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,460
civilized it's probably closer to 1.5

808
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,919
percent

809
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,380
but I'm I'm trying to think nice about

810
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,080
my fellow human at least until the next

811
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,779
one seventy percent of sheeple let's

812
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,419
let's see as nice as we possibly can 70

813
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,899
of us will still follow somebody often

814
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,600
off the edge of the bloody cliff

815
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,880
I know we do this because we still buy

816
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,580
technology that promises beyond the

817
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,700
wealth of avarice to protect us

818
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,899
we still buy clown strike

819
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:26,580
still by

820
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,440
what the hell's the other one

821
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,120
what's the stupid one with the bird that

822
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,520
is clown strike isn't it no

823
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,980
what's the stupid one with a bird

824
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,399
it is yeah that is a stupid one with a

825
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,720
butt

826
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,120
I got one word for that well done

827
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,500
actually

828
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,200
three words well done much

829
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,159
um

830
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,820
and let's be honest 15 or more are

831
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,919
thinking one two three four five six or

832
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,600
as the White House told us one one one

833
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,240
one one one one is a perfectly

834
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,220
acceptable password now the

835
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,020
sophisticated ones who are probably

836
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,340
someone in that extra 15 add 789 on to

837
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,360
the end

838
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,000
because they're the clever ones

839
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,700
or the news you you talk about the news

840
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,100
article that was freaking fantastic

841
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,380
Pizza one two three yeah

842
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,260
yeah these passwords are just silly

843
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,779
um we had a uh a recent

844
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,120
uh we had a marketing person leave and I

845
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,740
looked at this machine and I'm like wow

846
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,200
there's four gpus in this thing

847
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,039
that could be fun and so we we kicked

848
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,360
off uh

849
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,700
Kali Linux on it and uh and went after

850
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,559
our internal passwords for for a few

851
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,659
hours and had fun and you know passwords

852
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,580
come out the first time you do it

853
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,899
um one of the interesting things just

854
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,240
back back to an earlier slide is that

855
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,640
immediately I was asked who who had

856
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,559
these passwords I buy very senior

857
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,940
Executives and I was like nope not

858
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,880
telling not telling um we haven't taught

859
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,380
people we're just going to tell them

860
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,299
we're going to force the reset

861
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:58,860
um and and we did that and so you know

862
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,059
once once we get through the training

863
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,640
then maybe we'll tell but uh and the

864
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,080
first ones people use passwords that

865
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,159
they've probably been using their whole

866
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,480
career and that's always worked for them

867
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,520
and uh you know things like pizza one

868
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,380
two three show up yeah

869
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,720
and for those of you that wonder

870
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,039
pizza123 is in the news feel free to

871
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,419
Google it and then just bash your head

872
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,760
against the table for 30 seconds it's

873
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,260
pretty much about what the rest of us

874
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,460
did

875
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,820
so as far as the people think

876
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,960
again we have a choice

877
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,760
we can follow the way of doing things

878
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,340
and test people and humiliate them and

879
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,899
then send them back through more testing

880
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,580
and we all know how effective that works

881
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,140
because we've been talking about

882
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,380
passwords since well pretty much so what

883
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,559
day two of the internet actually day two

884
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,059
of anybody actually starting a freaking

885
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,760
computer day one hey let's use user ID

886
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,480
day two uh we need a password day three

887
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,700
 we need more passwords

888
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,820
and we're 30 40 years on from that

889
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,320
and we're still having the same

890
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,179
challenges

891
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,520
so it's it's something that's here to

892
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,960
stay because I would argue we've not

893
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,960
approached a lot of it effectively

894
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,600
we've taken the humans out of it

895
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,299
and we let's face it unfortunately a

896
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,000
security have kind of blamed everybody

897
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,399
there is a distinct possibility I have

898
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,500
stood up on stage of my life and blamed

899
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,260
humans and blamed users blamed my mother

900
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,840
probably blamed my grandmother we all

901
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,860
surrounded

902
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,500
but very rarely have we taken a step

903
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,340
back and gone what can we do differently

904
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,000
how can we change the message

905
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,799
how do we have the conversation how do

906
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,740
we roll out something like that in like

907
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,080
how short a time did you get out to roll

908
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,500
that in one week yeah 100 adoption like

909
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,480
rolled out across the freaking

910
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,679
Enterprise the entire organization done

911
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,299
thank you very apart from the fact they

912
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,340
did try to eat my my awareness training

913
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,480
system

914
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,000
probably it's Gabrielle's I'm blaming

915
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,740
him it's easier

916
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,679
but we have a choice we have a choice to

917
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,539
have these conversations in a various

918
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,820
civilized and well-meaning manner or we

919
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,520
have a choice to blame judge our banks

920
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,619
and this is what I love about this again

921
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,780
being the CSO I get to make those

922
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,599
choices I get to put stuff like this up

923
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,960
on the screen and go hey that's your

924
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,000
computer on the internet

925
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,918
and if you look at the back of my phone

926
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,780
of my phone with me I think it's in my

927
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,780
bag there's a there's a sticker online

928
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,440
buy some they're cool it simply says do

929
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,379
not pet the fluffy cows

930
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,418
for those of you that have ever been

931
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,280
through Yellowstone or have ever lived

932
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,739
in an agricultural area and you watch

933
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:46,918
city Folk stop and try to pet the

934
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,960
buffalo and the Bear

935
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,119
yeah

936
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,260
look it's pretty

937
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,760
yeah Muppet

938
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,000
of course it's gonna do that

939
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,180
but that sticker alone gets people

940
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,700
thinking

941
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,880
it makes you question reality in the

942
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,480
physical world now all we have to do is

943
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,160
make them think about the same thing in

944
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,720
the digital world

945
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,300
see you add humor in when Blake gets you

946
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,800
know when somebody gets another Blake

947
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,740
message hey we need apricots I put it on

948
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,599
the global slack channel the group slap

949
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,760
Channel and go hey guess what we're off

950
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,400
again P.S Blake doesn't need any more

951
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,619
gift cards

952
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,740
and we do it in a language that

953
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,040
everybody else understands we do it in a

954
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,260
way as it says really

955
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,940
where language gets

956
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,980
when we talk about security

957
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,680
to the business we talk about risk

958
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,380
we put it in technology and and what

959
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,540
Charles didn't say is that second time

960
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,520
when we when we spent an hour we were

961
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,320
actually to his point we were there for

962
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,839
an hour

963
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,140
we did over a hundred

964
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,839
I was way over 100 slides

965
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,079
way over 100 slides before we went to

966
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,640
the board

967
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,099
and to be very honest it was a pain in

968
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:17,040
the freaking ass

969
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,220
but long term it was worth it

970
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,099
because we got the context

971
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:27,119
we got the language we worked with the

972
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,119
CFO we worked with the advisory team we

973
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,900
worked with others to hone the language

974
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,880
to what they were looking for and I want

975
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,079
you to talk about a bunch of this but

976
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,640
before you do there's one thing that I

977
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,560
really loved the first and the second

978
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,680
time we turned up at The Advisory team

979
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,359
um some of the advisors and some of the

980
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,800
board members obviously sit on other

981
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,960
boards in the security space and

982
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,780
everything else so they came to our

983
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,460
first board and probably the second one

984
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,660
going well we've done it like this

985
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,820
everywhere else what I'm really looking

986
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,500
forward to now is they're gonna go back

987
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,839
to their other themes and go these

988
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,400
 have got right why the

989
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,380
hell aren't you doing it that way

990
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,579
yes

991
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:08,220
we change we change through language we

992
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,359
change through demonstration so I don't

993
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,859
go for it one of the important things

994
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,079
about having this conversation with your

995
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,760
your senior management team and and

996
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,320
ultimately your board is to find out

997
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,300
what what do they want to know

998
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,760
what is it that they need to know what

999
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,020
do they see what are they talking to

1000
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,240
their peers about and really going after

1001
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,880
that we got a uh an excellent education

1002
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,460
from from one of the board members

1003
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,079
um about what they need to see that you

1004
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,579
know it isn't just self-assessment they

1005
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,320
need to see external they're managing

1006
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,640
risk that's what the board does they're

1007
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,839
trying to understand the risk of the

1008
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,400
company and make sure that you're doing

1009
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,480
the right things they're not trying to

1010
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,000
micromanage you so it was really useful

1011
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,160
to just talk through like what sorts of

1012
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,020
things they wanted to see what what are

1013
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,220
things that they're used to seeing in

1014
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,859
their career why those are or aren't

1015
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:54,599
good things to continue to look at like

1016
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,339
how many hack attempts per day or you

1017
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:57,839
know the things that we've all shown

1018
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,839
that are kind of useless and starting to

1019
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,060
lay out that path of what we could be

1020
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,920
looking at like how do you actually look

1021
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,599
at risk in a business what's an

1022
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,220
appropriate risk to take and then

1023
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,780
ultimately putting it all in business

1024
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,859
terms

1025
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,260
um that like how many days do you want

1026
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,020
your systems to be open to being hacked

1027
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,180
that's a question we're talking about

1028
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,700
patching well patching rates right patch

1029
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,619
every 30 days that could be our SLA so

1030
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,359
we're open to being hacked for for 30

1031
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,200
days

1032
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,520
right do you want to pay a little bit

1033
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,619
more maybe we do it in 15 days and

1034
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,060
that's the conversation it's more about

1035
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,220
what's happening in the business not you

1036
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,200
know how many machines are at what patch

1037
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,460
level and things like that is less

1038
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,540
interesting

1039
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,280
um than turning it into a business in a

1040
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,320
risk conversation and so this is really

1041
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,420
working out again if you're not doing it

1042
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,040
I encourage you to start down that path

1043
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,359
and having business language

1044
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,280
conversations about Security in your

1045
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,060
business

1046
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,579
yeah totally the next slide I think

1047
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,960
we've covered and we've beaten this one

1048
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,180
up but I've always had this one and

1049
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,040
there's just a standard simple slide

1050
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,320
which is we need to use languages that

1051
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,300
others understand and again for the

1052
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,980
vendors here and for those buggers that

1053
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,020
are out there when you're out there on

1054
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,460
the other side of the thing and the

1055
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,320
vendor starts going and my student can

1056
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,619
do it's on the stop

1057
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,180
tell them say hey talk to me about this

1058
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,320
in English

1059
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,300
what are you actually trying to explain

1060
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,640
to me in a language not that I would

1061
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,140
understand as the geek but I would

1062
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,119
understand as maybe the buyer or the

1063
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,440
business person

1064
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,599
or somebody tell them ask them what the

1065
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,800
hell it means if they were talking to

1066
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,960
their mother grandmother grandparents or

1067
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,420
Guardian

1068
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,940
stop with the acronyms

1069
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,440
so

1070
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,440
some lessons so far and this is

1071
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,480
well you've been there a year I've got

1072
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,579
half that time on you so I'm going to

1073
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,260
run through just a couple of these

1074
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,460
because there's a few other slides we're

1075
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,599
running on the slide so we've been

1076
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,400
pretty good today and I think we've

1077
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,900
covered a lot of this stuff and this was

1078
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,520
just kind of bullet points and things on

1079
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,480
this one

1080
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,240
the key one for me or the key ones for

1081
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,020
me

1082
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,760
was the fact and this is one of the

1083
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,980
closing slides that I have was the

1084
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,480
simple fact that

1085
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,180
I can touch literally poke and touch

1086
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,599
with consent the I.T folks I can do the

1087
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,220
same thing with the software folks I can

1088
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,320
do the same thing with the engineers I

1089
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,900
can get off of my ass and I can walk

1090
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,720
from here probably to those back doors

1091
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,660
and I could look down in the hanger

1092
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,940
if I ever lose focus as to what the hell

1093
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,040
I'm doing I literally walked to that

1094
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,660
door I looked down into the hangar

1095
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,420
although it's a hp2 at the moment but I

1096
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,760
can look at the experimental jet that's

1097
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,780
there

1098
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,180
I can look at the people working on it I

1099
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,859
can look at everybody with engines in

1100
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,079
and engines out in fuel in a fuel out

1101
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,660
and taxing and all the other stuff we

1102
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,820
get every single week

1103
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,920
Jeff who's what the head of engineering

1104
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,320
basically and the whole craziness Jeff

1105
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,440
sends out of status update every week

1106
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,079
how's the plane doing

1107
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,680
what's good what's bad what's ugly

1108
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,640
so we're all focused in the same bloody

1109
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,680
Direction

1110
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,180
and this is one of the things I've

1111
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,980
walked into numerous companies as a

1112
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,160
virtual CSO and I I will never forget

1113
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,900
walking into one of the biggest auto

1114
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,000
manufacturers out there

1115
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,400
and talking to the security team who

1116
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,660
weren't talking to the network team

1117
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,160
because the network team had gone up on

1118
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,359
bought their own Monitor and it wasn't

1119
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,160
the one the security team wanted the

1120
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,839
security team was going to go by its own

1121
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,780
and the Network's like

1122
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,119
you get your paycheck from the same

1123
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,099
freaking company

1124
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,920
you can walk out of your damn Silo and

1125
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,780
looking at manufacturing facility and go

1126
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,599
hey I'm part of that or you can sit your

1127
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,760
ass in here and decide that you don't

1128
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,980
want to talk to your colleagues

1129
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,440
get off your ass go down to the coffee

1130
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,079
shop buy coffee get donuts walk over

1131
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,660
there eat some Humble Pie and go hey how

1132
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,000
can we work more effectively together

1133
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,880
it's simple yeah we don't want to do it

1134
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,579
so my encouragement on all of this stuff

1135
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:01,920
because I see it works

1136
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,260
is to do that

1137
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,020
there is a better way

1138
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,480
I don't know add anything or do we put

1139
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,300
Steve up on screen almost for Steve

1140
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,400
um if you're struggling to get attention

1141
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,160
in your business get money get closer to

1142
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,260
the mission get closer to the revenue

1143
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,720
chain get involved in what the company's

1144
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,760
actually delivering and focus your

1145
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,099
security efforts there and making that

1146
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:27,180
better

1147
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,680
um that I think ultimately that's what

1148
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,060
we're talking about you get like

1149
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,560
understand what your company's mission

1150
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,660
is from a business perspective speak in

1151
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,339
those terms about how you're enabling

1152
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:36,900
Revenue

1153
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,060
um when I first joined boom there was a

1154
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,800
and this is public so there's a

1155
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,960
strategic financing opportunity with the

1156
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,119
Air Force looked like 60 million or so

1157
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,740
that's a lot of money for a pre-revenue

1158
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,000
startup

1159
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,800
um and I said hey have you guys talked

1160
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,079
to him about this or like what what they

1161
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,820
need to like what kind of scores they

1162
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,859
need from us and I said no we haven't

1163
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:57,300
done that yet so I said you should go

1164
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,619
talk to the procurement person they came

1165
00:42:58,619 --> 00:42:59,940
back they're like oh yeah we need 800

1166
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,579
171 assessment like when's this due next

1167
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,859
week okay

1168
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,680
we can do this so we sat with the team

1169
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,780
through the gauntlet down and we worked

1170
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,040
around the clock and got that initial

1171
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,619
assessment and sprs score in and that

1172
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:15,000
resulted in Revenue so like getting

1173
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,680
close to your mission getting close to

1174
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,359
your revenue is a way that you can

1175
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:21,240
unlock doors and open up the possibility

1176
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,859
of good conversations within your

1177
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:25,140
organization you know I want this was

1178
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,880
the slide I wanted I'd love you to talk

1179
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,520
about when I first started a boom

1180
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,859
actually how many okay here's a question

1181
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,440
for you how many of you have started at

1182
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,839
a company and you haven't just got like

1183
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,540
a welcome to the company

1184
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,220
you've actually got a road map that's

1185
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,260
been laid out for you here is what I

1186
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,579
Look to You to achieve in the first

1187
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,160
seven days the first 30 days in the

1188
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,020
first 90 days how many of you have

1189
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,839
actually got one of those before

1190
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,140
yeah first time I got one was working

1191
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,160
for him

1192
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,160
and my ass is great let's be honest I

1193
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,260
might have run for you a few jobs holy

1194
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,420
 what a difference

1195
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,579
first and foremost because he gave me

1196
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,800
bullet points to hit things to think

1197
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,160
about people to go talk to stuff to do

1198
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,440
wins it gave me quick wins

1199
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,020
secondly it also helped me understand

1200
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,079
some of the acronyms ironically that we

1201
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,640
have inside the company

1202
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,560
and this was another one of those things

1203
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,240
again how many of you inside the

1204
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,819
companies you're in know what the key

1205
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,040
two or three goals are for that company

1206
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,660
for the year

1207
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,579
how many of you

1208
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:34,140
but you go put your bloody hand down

1209
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,660
this is a freaking company

1210
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,720
so yeah not many of you

1211
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,780
it's up there day one there are these

1212
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,880
here you explain you got all this we

1213
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,440
have a thing called the BB3 the boom big

1214
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,240
three and these are the top three things

1215
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,280
that we're working on and that was uh

1216
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,380
that that was part of the 90-day plan if

1217
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,579
you haven't read the book The First 90

1218
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:57,000
days uh recommend taking a look at it uh

1219
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,500
there are good plans out there it's it's

1220
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,359
a great way to get ramped up you can

1221
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,099
apply that book anytime you get a

1222
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,560
promotion anytime you uh your

1223
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,940
organization grows you add a person to

1224
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,460
the team it's a good opportunity for a

1225
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,040
first 90 day plan for you and for the

1226
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,900
new person uh and so this it's it's

1227
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,420
really good to have a road map and and a

1228
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,460
really quick ramp up so within weeks

1229
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,859
Chris was effective because he had met

1230
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:21,119
all the people he needed to had the

1231
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,339
conversations he needed to uh and and

1232
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:25,020
laid out his own roadmap from there and

1233
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,700
in fact I was watching in the document

1234
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,099
as it just exploded with things that he

1235
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,200
was learning he needed to do uh so

1236
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,540
really really interesting way of of

1237
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,700
getting somebody quickly ramped up and

1238
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,200
this is difficult especially at senior

1239
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,940
levels when you bring on senior folks to

1240
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,380
get them really active in the

1241
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,660
organization quickly I think is critical

1242
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,880
and and I've seen so many times when

1243
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,740
that just doesn't happen

1244
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,280
and I think to the to the Boom Big Three

1245
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,660
Hazel gets interesting because those can

1246
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,220
be really esoteric and everybody's like

1247
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,079
well how the hell am I part of this

1248
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:57,420
those Boom Big Three then get broken

1249
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,579
down into tasks

1250
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:02,700
so and we report on those

1251
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,680
I mean we sit down almost all a weekly

1252
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,599
basis let's face it and they get

1253
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,180
reported out on a weekly basis and

1254
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,160
they're divided up engineering's got

1255
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,560
some we've got some software that's got

1256
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,300
some Finance I've got so in fact pretty

1257
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,060
much for everybody who's got some

1258
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,839
so everybody knows what the hell they're

1259
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,480
doing and why not just what are they

1260
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,940
doing but why are they doing it why is

1261
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,040
it critical that that works it also

1262
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,319
forces to some degree the collaboration

1263
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:33,060
conversation

1264
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,480
it makes you sit down and go hey I can't

1265
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,280
do this on my own

1266
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,440
perfect example

1267
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,240
compliance

1268
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,460
whenever security mentions compliance

1269
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,500
literally half of three quarters ninety

1270
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,700
percent of us go oh

1271
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:55,260
yet inside boom Kate who runs compliance

1272
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,480
best friend

1273
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,020
freaking awesome working with her

1274
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,500
because we have a common goal we have a

1275
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,780
common communication to Legal we have a

1276
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,420
common conversation with I.T we have a

1277
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,400
common discussion with engineering we

1278
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,040
have common conversations with Finance

1279
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,859
we're working in the same bloody

1280
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:18,720
Direction

1281
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,960
we actually collaborate on basically how

1282
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,220
to Leverage

1283
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,460
the two teams to get to some degree kind

1284
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,079
of what we need

1285
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,480
as opposed to being diametrically

1286
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,859
opposed

1287
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:35,220
which is the case in most organizations

1288
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,960
and the other thing that comes into this

1289
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,880
one too which is where this next slide

1290
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,079
comes in

1291
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,000
you said with an hour of authority there

1292
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,500
we go

1293
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,300
this is where this next slide comes in

1294
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,099
and I love this

1295
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:50,160
for a whole bunch of different reasons

1296
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,900
when I when Charles and I were talking

1297
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,400
about me going into boom we talked about

1298
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,980
reporting structure as a CSO reporting

1299
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,260
structures kind of important because you

1300
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,960
want to get done especially me I

1301
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,359
want to do things well that was fun no

1302
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,520
 gets done

1303
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,980
depending upon how you report and where

1304
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,640
you report often happens in the case

1305
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,680
depends on how effective you can be

1306
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,720
Charles was like hey we report into the

1307
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,859
CFO and I'm like oh

1308
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,599
not only do we report into the CFO we

1309
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,180
report into the CFO whose previous

1310
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,040
organization was one of those big stoic

1311
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,599
manufacturing companies where everybody

1312
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,520
had their tears and everybody had their

1313
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,619
layers and God forbids you step out of

1314
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,420
layer or tear or if you ask a question

1315
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,640
you're a toast

1316
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,859
that's where we came out of

1317
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:44,819
that is our CFO

1318
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,440
he learned

1319
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,180
he listened

1320
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,420
he actually sat down and said I don't

1321
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,240
understand fully how security works

1322
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,520
now let's face it a lot of us have been

1323
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,859
like oh whatever no you sit and you get

1324
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:02,099
on a whiteboard and you spend time with

1325
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:04,740
him you did a crazy amazing job before I

1326
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,119
even freaking showed up for crying out

1327
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,099
loud basically softening you up

1328
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:11,099
without beating him up put that one out

1329
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,640
there so that's Steve that's our CFO he

1330
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,880
is as you can see lock picking

1331
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,440
first time he's ever done it I think

1332
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,560
first time yeah so we have lockpicks

1333
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,359
sitting out on the desk and we have lots

1334
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:25,440
sitting out on the desk and they keep

1335
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,180
expecting the locks are having sex we

1336
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,579
keep getting more of it down thanks

1337
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:32,040
so it's kind of fun

1338
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,800
and yet he's sitting there he's joining

1339
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,839
in he's part of it

1340
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,700
so again this is one of those things

1341
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,099
where and oftentimes our preconceived

1342
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:43,200
notions are wrong or even if they're

1343
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,119
right there's a way of going all right

1344
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,760
how do we make this work

1345
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,960
how can we have a conversation that he

1346
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,760
is comfortable with

1347
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,700
so a lot of stuff on that one

1348
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,680
I like that one

1349
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,359
I'm gonna run through this one or we're

1350
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:01,619
going to run through this one quickly

1351
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,780
soft skills

1352
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,060
communication cooperation coordination

1353
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,619
collaboration

1354
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:09,660
I kidnap this screen from the internet

1355
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,339
because it's good and it explains

1356
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:12,480
everything

1357
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,520
you can turn around and say hey I

1358
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,099
communicate and I I cooperate

1359
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,960
well the simple fact is even if you're

1360
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,520
cooperating you're still in your sodium

1361
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,680
silo

1362
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,220
you're still doing individual things

1363
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,319
so then you move this set so the

1364
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,480
coordination part of it which means hey

1365
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,280
we might actually be doing the same

1366
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,680
stuff in the similar direction we have

1367
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,500
kind of shared objectives but maybe I

1368
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,440
still have my own agenda

1369
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,780
how many of you would say you have a

1370
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,160
joint approach

1371
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,560
and mutual objectives

1372
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,200
inside your organizations that you all

1373
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,260
adhere to it's tough

1374
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,059
and if you're like crap off companies

1375
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,700
too big then stop with your own team

1376
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,099
start with the it in the info sect team

1377
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,619
start making friends and going how can I

1378
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:04,140
move it from Simply I'm gonna stick my

1379
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,720
head out of my solo so hey we're going

1380
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,759
to work on this together

1381
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,660
so in closing we'll keep this simple

1382
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,980
because we are running up against time

1383
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,099
on this way

1384
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:21,180
in closing

1385
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,280
this is fun I'm back in the Aerospace

1386
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,780
industry legally

1387
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,440
okay

1388
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,000
and we're going to change things

1389
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,700
and what I would love to do is keep

1390
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,619
coming back every now and again

1391
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,079
Charles and I or maybe Kate and Charles

1392
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,300
and I or maybe you leave me alone and

1393
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,859
just Kate and you just come up with

1394
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:45,660
whatever the hell it is

1395
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,000
but just kind of report out

1396
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,059
on what's working and what's not worth

1397
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:52,740
I'd love to do that every now and again

1398
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,780
just keep coming up and going hey shit's

1399
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,579
good or yeah but it smells this moment

1400
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,740
in time which it will do

1401
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,660
but then how do you change it and how do

1402
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,440
you fix it because realistically

1403
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,140
we all we're all coming at this from

1404
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,640
totally different directions let's be

1405
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,480
honest

1406
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,420
my finance man a finance man came with

1407
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,980
this from all sorts of Ivy League

1408
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,300
shenanigans

1409
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,800
then he runs up against me a sarcastic

1410
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,200
guilt-wearing Green Bay Packers loving

1411
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,380
bloody hacker let's face it

1412
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,980
but we're in the same boat we are rowing

1413
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,440
in the same freaking Direction

1414
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,240
and that's really what I want to take I

1415
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,800
want everybody to try and take away from

1416
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,920
this is there are better ways

1417
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,599
and the nice thing about it is you can

1418
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,099
affect change now it takes more than

1419
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:43,980
just one person it takes the team it

1420
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,540
takes having somebody in the leadership

1421
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,280
position to be able to do that as well

1422
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,559
so for that pretty damn thankful

1423
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,839
all right

1424
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,540
so for everybody thank you thanks for

1425
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,640
everybody listening hope this was useful

1426
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,260
I get to hang out here for the rest of

1427
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,520
the day Charles is here for the rest day

1428
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,200
if you need to ask him how the hell he

1429
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,480
puts up with me that's probably like the

1430
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,920
secret the life universe and everything

1431
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,260
right there

1432
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,760
um so let's do it let's actually

1433
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,180
freaking change things please

1434
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,040
I'm done with doing the same things the

1435
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,579
same ways I'm very fortunate that I get

1436
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,220
to change things so again hopefully we

1437
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,020
get to come back every now and again and

1438
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,180
go hey here's how we do it so with that
