00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,080

[Music]

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,489
[Music]

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,520
[Music]

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,140
[Music]

6
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,820
and so my name is Teresa lanowitz and

7
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm head of cyber security evangelism

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,660
with at T cyber security and just a

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,000
little bit about my background yes I did

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,280
play College rugby at the University of

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,159
Pittsburgh and it is an awesome sport I

12
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,400
played second row for three years and

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,020
then I played eight Manor lock for the

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,060
fourth year the other person who was in

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,640
second round with me she graduated so I

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,560
needed someone my exact size so I went

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,240
to lock if you know anything about rugby

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,299
so probably after I played rugby and

19
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,479
prior to joining at T cyber security I

20
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,119
was an analyst industry analyst so I

21
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,040
worked for a company called Gartner and

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,840
I also worked for for a boutique analyst

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,360
firm called vote for a number of years

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,939
prior to that I was a product manager at

25
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,700
Borland I was product manager on C plus

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,220
plus I was the original product manager

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,380
on Borland J Builder the Java

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,659
development environment so not only do I

29
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,000
love cyber security I also love

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,759
application development and while I was

31
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,560
a Gartner I started writing about

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,700
application security back in 2001 2002

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,860
and I was on the application development

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,119
team covering quality assurance and the

35
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,818
of course the siled security people came

36
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,080
to me when I started writing about

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,599
application security and they said hey

38
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,620
app developer stay in your lane we don't

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,360
need you talking about application

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,540
security we have everything covered so

41
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,060
just a little bit of background there I

42
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,739
started my career as a software

43
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,420
developer with McDonnell Douglas the

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,540
airplane company and I held a top secret

45
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,220
U.S Department of Defense security

46
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,900
clearance there when I was working on

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,120
the C-17 so that's just a little bit

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
about me a little bit about my

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,360
background but what we're here to talk

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
about today is the at T cyber security

51
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,340
insights report

52
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,040
so we all know this right the more

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,819
democratized compute becomes the more at

54
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,400
risk we are the more adversaries take a

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
look at this and say wow it's pretty

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,540
interesting if we think back to the

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,940
Mainframe days when the only people who

58
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,160
could get access to that Mainframe data

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,019
center were the people who work there

60
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,540
our biggest security risk was someone

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,120
coming into the data center kicking the

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,920
court out from the wall spilling coffee

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,200
on the keyboard but the moment we

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,959
democratize compute and when out into

65
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,840
the Departments with PCS connected via

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,000
lands we started to see cyber

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,459
adversaries so we saw those hobbyist

68
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,099
hackers people who said huh I'm going to

69
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,200
leave a digital signature just to show

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,420
you that I am smarter than you are we

71
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,760
then evolved into web applications

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,580
mobile applications everything hosted on

73
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,319
the cloud so we lost control very

74
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,659
quickly and the Cyber adversaries

75
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,940
realize that as well so they said well

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,280
you know what now we can go we can

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,739
extract money from these people by

78
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,480
committing DDOS attacks by committing

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,959
ransomware attacks we can get our

80
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,239
political points of view across by being

81
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,480
hacktivists again executing DDOS attacks

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,379
for example and we can also from a

83
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,760
well-coordinated nation-state

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,680
perspective really say you know what

85
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
we're going to hold you hostage for

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,519
something so those are those you know

87
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,739
those new types of cyber adversaries if

88
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,680
you will and now we move to this idea of

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
edge Computing we're really at the edge

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,899
if you will or we're poised on the

91
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,019
precipice of a new era of computing this

92
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,960
new era of computing is Edge Computing

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,479
so if you think about the edge

94
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,660
Edge the applications in Edge are

95
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,820
completely different the network for

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,220
Edge is completely different those

97
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,380
applications for the most part are

98
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,560
headless non-guy applications

99
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,840
um the the network is completely

100
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,479
different it's all about that data so

101
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,220
the adversaries are having a really good

102
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,259
time with this and they're figuring out

103
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,720
how to attack these Edge type

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,600
applications so what we wanted to do is

105
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,940
we wanted to figure out where people

106
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,060
were on that Journey to the edge and how

107
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,860
they were protecting those applications

108
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,740
that data and those endpoints they were

109
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,240
connecting to these new types of

110
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,000
networks or connecting to the cloud so

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,919
this report the at T cyber security

112
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,220
insights report while it has a t in the

113
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,979
name in the title it is a vendor neutral

114
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,740
report it's forward-looking with

115
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,780
actionable advice and we use the

116
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,419
industry analyst firm IDC to help us

117
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,960
gather the data so IDC goes out and and

118
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,300
does the field survey for us they have a

119
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,880
really great uh

120
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,500
survey house so they'll create the

121
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,479
questions so that we're not leading the

122
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,940
witness for example and we do a mix of

123
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,039
quantitative analysis as well as

124
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,620
qualitative analysis the quantitative

125
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,479
analysis we certainly get from the

126
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,400
survey that we conduct the field survey

127
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,860
and the qualitative analysis we

128
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,199
interview subject matter experts inside

129
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,960
of at T as well as with the partner

130
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,240
sponsors that we work with so just a

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,979
little bit about the demographics on

132
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,479
this survey we surveyed

133
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,520
1520 professionals from around the world

134
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,220
so that includes North America Latin

135
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,220
America in emea it's UK Ireland France

136
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,479
and Germany and in aipac it's Australia

137
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,419
India South Korea and Singapore and we

138
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,100
wanted to talk to people who were cyber

139
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,020
Security Professionals application

140
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,000
development professionals

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,940
also line of business people and the

142
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,500
reason we wanted to talk to the line of

143
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,100
business is because the line of business

144
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,360
interestingly enough we found out in our

145
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,880
2021 research the line is business

146
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,680
they're the ones that are really driving

147
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,199
this new way of computing they're the

148
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,419
ones that are saying we want to bring in

149
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,900
a 5G Network so we can create Edge use

150
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,900
cases Edge experience but they're also

151
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,780
saying we're not going to do this unless

152
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,060
we are in lockstep with the cyber

153
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,520
security team and we also know that that

154
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,919
cyber security team because of the

155
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,380
pandemic that security team has moved

156
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,419
from being this very technical group of

157
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:07,020
people to being part of the business to

158
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,000
being a business enabler and a business

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,280
imperative so those are that's a little

160
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,139
bit about the demographics we also

161
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,900
surveyed six industry verticals Finance

162
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,479
Health Care retail manufacturing energy

163
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,660
and utilities and U.S public sector

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,060
so we I mentioned we do a lot of

165
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,819
qualitative analysis as well these are

166
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,680
the subject matter experts who helped us

167
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,620
inform this report at T Akamai

168
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,080
checkpoint Cisco digital defense

169
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
Fortinet Juniper Networks Palo Alto

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,660
networks red shield Sentinel one and

171
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,160
VMware

172
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,039
so I've mentioned the word Edge a couple

173
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,180
of times

174
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,220
what does edge mean

175
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,000
we found out through our research that

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,039
etch has different meanings to different

177
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,680
people if you ask 10 different people

178
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,080
the definition of edge you'll probably

179
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,900
get 11 different answers so there's a

180
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,419
lot of confusion around how people are

181
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,819
interpreting Edge right now

182
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,500
so what we found out through our

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,720
research is that there are three common

184
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,819
characteristics that people really

185
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,880
gravitate to for Edge the first is it's

186
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,000
a distributed model of management

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,919
intelligence and networks so that

188
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,860
distribution is key the second

189
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,199
characteristic is that the applications

190
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,860
the workloads hosting it's all closer to

191
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,800
where that data is being created and

192
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,919
consumed because as we move forward data

193
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,899
becomes the most important currency that

194
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,299
we're concerned with so everything is

195
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,099
closer to where that data is being

196
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,919
created and consumed and the third

197
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
characteristic is that the edge is

198
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,580
software defined and this can mean

199
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,620
on-premises or in the cloud so those are

200
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,839
the three common characteristics so if

201
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,399
you're having this discussion in your

202
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,980
own organizations about should we do

203
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,279
Edge should we not do it Edge get a

204
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,560
clarification on what people mean you

205
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,779
know use these characteristics don't you

206
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,640
know tell me I'm wrong with these

207
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,220
characteristics but have a level set of

208
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,779
what you mean with Edge because

209
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,019
everybody has a different meaning for it

210
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,899
so one of the things we found in our at

211
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,880
T cyber security insights report for

212
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,080
2022 we took away three big findings

213
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,760
the first

214
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,140
is that

215
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,120
people are moving to the edge

216
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,660
75 percent of the survey participants

217
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,580
who took our survey remember n is 1520

218
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,440
75 percent of them said yeah we're

219
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,480
moving to the edge we are either in that

220
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,580
ideation phase where we're researching

221
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,519
it we're in a proof of concept stage or

222
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,980
we're in full-scale rollout of an edge

223
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,880
use case so that was pretty encouraging

224
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,040
the second big aha that we took away

225
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
from this

226
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,300
is that it's still a 50 50 world out

227
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,480
there a lot of things on premise still a

228
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,760
lot of things in the cloud so if you you

229
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,339
know listen to all the hype you would

230
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,320
think that everybody has moved full

231
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,660
scale 100 to the cloud our research

232
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,940
found differently there's still a hybrid

233
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,580
world out there for a variety of reasons

234
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,740
and we go into that in more detail in

235
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,820
the report

236
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,940
and the third big aha that we found is

237
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,399
that as organizations move to the edge

238
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,100
as they start to bring in these Edge use

239
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,580
cases they say we need to figure out

240
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,339
which cyber security controls we're

241
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,100
going to take with us to the edge or

242
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,200
which Legacy cyber security controls

243
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,760
we're just going to use for these other

244
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,339
things that we still have to support

245
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,160
so there's this idea of what cyber

246
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,660
security controls are you going to use

247
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,579
at the edge and we have a lot of detail

248
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,279
on that and what people thought and one

249
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,140
of the big ahas we took away from this

250
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,339
is that 65 of our survey respondents

251
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,579
said they're working with a third party

252
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:05,040
on their Journey to the edge that means

253
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,899
they're working with a Consulting

254
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,980
organization manage security services

255
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,260
Global Systems integrator some type of

256
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,660
vendor and so this is really important

257
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,399
that people are saying you know what as

258
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,440
we move to the edge we're not going to

259
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,420
do this do it yourself

260
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,339
what we're also finding and this is what

261
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,260
we're finding from the 2023 research

262
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,420
that we're conducting right now we're

263
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,740
finding that

264
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,100
the those decades-old silos that have

265
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,220
been erected those decades-old silos are

266
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,980
starting to erode and starting is the

267
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,320
key word there but those silos that have

268
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,779
been built up between Network

269
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,180
application development

270
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,480
security the line of business those

271
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,360
silos are starting to erode and as you

272
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,120
move to the edge the stakes are too high

273
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,940
the outcomes are too critical so you

274
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,240
can't have those silos that have been

275
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
erected over the past several decades

276
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,399
really playing a factor so as we go

277
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,899
we'll take each of these key findings

278
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,060
one by one and I'll share with you some

279
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,800
data that we found

280
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
so Edge momentum

281
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,440
as I said 75 of the people who took our

282
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,959
survey said they are moving to the edge

283
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,720
when we saw this we thought wow this is

284
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,880
really great this is very encouraging

285
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,860
because I think when people think of the

286
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,839
edge they think of self-driving cars

287
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,160
that's the first thing that comes to

288
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,019
mind and you'll see here in this data

289
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,000
self-driving cars did not even crack the

290
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,579
top tent so there's a movement to the

291
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,220
edge so what are people doing moving to

292
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,420
the edge

293
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,600
we wanted to find out where people were

294
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,620
with their use cases in production were

295
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,300
they thinking about Edge were they going

296
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,399
off doing some research maybe talking to

297
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,440
others who have been doing this

298
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,839
or were they in a proof of concept mode

299
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,720
where things did not have to scale or

300
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,940
were they in full-scale production where

301
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,920
they could roll things out

302
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,440
so the way we read this slide

303
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,320
is that on the y-axis we have the

304
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,820
different verticals that we surveyed

305
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,380
Finance

306
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,980
Healthcare energy and utilities

307
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,019
manufacturing U.S public sector and

308
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,459
Retail

309
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,399
on the x-axis we have different colors

310
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,880
bar different color bars so the gray is

311
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,040
there it's the low stage they're out

312
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,459
there researching ideating maybe reading

313
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,220
some white papers maybe kind of doing

314
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,560
some experimentation but it's the

315
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,019
ideation phase the low stage the

316
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,720
mid-stage is proof of concept yeah we've

317
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,180
done our research and we think we can do

318
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,940
this let's try this with a small scale

319
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,360
roll it out to a few people nothing at

320
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,279
scale

321
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,459
and the dark blue which is the mature

322
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,220
stage that's we're in production with

323
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,220
this right now so if we take a look at

324
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,540
this for example retail the bottom line

325
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,940
52 of organizations who identify as

326
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,220
retail organizations taking the survey

327
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,500
said that they are in the mature stage

328
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,620
of production with Edge use cases

329
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,680
so what are these use cases the top two

330
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,079
use cases that came back they were tied

331
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,399
for first place 59 each retail loss

332
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,339
prevention and Manufacturing video

333
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,740
quality inspection on the manufacturing

334
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,700
floor

335
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,160
the other top use cases that came back

336
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
for energy it's remote monitoring so

337
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,040
remote monitoring of an off-site oil rig

338
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,500
for example

339
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,040
in finance it was concierge services so

340
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,260
conscious Air Services plus real-time

341
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,480
fraud detection they were very closely

342
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,760
tied so that's how Finance is really

343
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,880
using the edge and defining the edge

344
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,279
Healthcare everybody knows the

345
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,260
healthcare use case we've all probably

346
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,320
had video appointments with our

347
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,940
physicians at some point over the past

348
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,820
couple of years the pandemic accelerated

349
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,100
what Healthcare is doing in terms of

350
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,160
edge so the pandemic accelerated that

351
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,620
use case of I want to have a video

352
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,959
conference call with my doctor

353
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,880
the other big thing that came up for us

354
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,980
with Healthcare were pop-up remote

355
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,500
clinics especially with a pandemic the

356
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,240
remote testing sites that had to be

357
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,279
fully secure so that when you go in

358
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,800
there your sample is tested then they

359
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,420
need to be able to identify you they

360
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,399
need to be able to get those samples

361
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,620
back to the to the to the branch office

362
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,720
to the branch hospital if you see if you

363
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,240
if you prefer but that needed to be

364
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,760
secure as well

365
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,560
manufacturing video quality inspection

366
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,959
on the assembly line so being able to

367
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,660
use cameras and sensors on an assembly

368
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,980
line to say I'm able to identify where a

369
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,440
defect is being put into whatever it is

370
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,079
I'm producing in near real time

371
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,440
I can then also say well I see that

372
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,959
defect going in I know how many widgets

373
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,060
on my assembly line have been produced I

374
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,100
can go and I can get those those widgets

375
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,079
back so that really helps with business

376
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,740
outcomes in terms of recall efforts it

377
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,079
really helps to minimize retail

378
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,800
or the how to minimize the recall

379
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,699
efforts of something that may have been

380
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,500
produced with a known defect that went

381
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,519
in

382
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,880
in U.S public sector the top use case

383
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,000
was Public Safety so for Public Safety

384
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,740
what they told us in U.S public sector

385
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,079
is and this was for state and local

386
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,120
government and higher education what

387
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,160
they told us was they wanted to be able

388
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,740
to use Edge Computing for identification

389
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,440
of what was going on noises for example

390
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
the example that we got back quite a bit

391
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,019
people said well if somebody calls and

392
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,579
reports to their local police department

393
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,320
they heard what they thought was a

394
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,959
gunshot was it really a gunshot or is it

395
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
just noise from a loud party down the

396
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,860
street so they're trying to use Edge for

397
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,959
that type of use case

398
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,839
and then retail loss prevention so those

399
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,359
are the types of use cases that people

400
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,299
were using for the edge today these are

401
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,520
the types of use cases that are being

402
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,660
deployed

403
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,000
and this shows us the use cases in the

404
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,760
state of adoption and what use cases are

405
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,579
are out there so it's no surprise that

406
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,160
the top use cases are with industrial

407
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,660
iot iot types of devices Enterprise iot

408
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,080
functions industry oriented consumer iot

409
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,299
functions but if you look all the way

410
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,220
down the very last thing I have on this

411
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,960
chart autonomous vehicles 20 20 percent

412
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,900
of our survey respondents said yes we're

413
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,419
thinking about using Edge for autonomous

414
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,860
vehicles so that's a much much lower

415
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,840
rating or lower ranking than something

416
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,900
like augmented reality or something like

417
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,720
an iot function so there are a lot of

418
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,700
edge use cases going on out there right

419
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,120
now and people are deploying to the edge

420
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,840
we wanted to find out what the perceived

421
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,679
risk was of deploying to the edge so

422
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,100
each of our vertical industries that we

423
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,260
surveyed came back and said here's where

424
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,140
we perceive the risk what they told us

425
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,080
was they believe that the

426
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,380
the likelihood of a risk the likelihood

427
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,240
of a cyber risk the likelihood of a

428
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,360
cyber compromise was highly likely and

429
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,799
they also said

430
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,740
if we do have a cyber incident it's

431
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,020
going to have a significant impact on

432
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,559
the business so if you think back five

433
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,980
ten years ago the line of business and a

434
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,400
cyber risk were completely disparate one

435
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,960
did not necessarily know what the other

436
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,200
was doing now with the edge because we

437
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,419
have these very high stakes people are

438
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,820
saying if there is a cyber risk it's

439
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,520
going to impact the business so this is

440
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440
to me this is really good news because

441
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,260
that again is starting to show that you

442
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,480
have those erosion of those silos that

443
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,360
have been built up that security is now

444
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,660
part of business it is has a full seat

445
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,780
at the table if you will and really is

446
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,240
part of being a business enabler and a

447
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,799
business initiative

448
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,980
so this particular chart is a scatter

449
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,059
chart

450
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,400
but we had to blow it up because

451
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,260
you see that all of the six vertical

452
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,720
industries that we surveyed are fairly

453
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,000
close together there in terms of how

454
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,720
they rank the likelihood of an attack

455
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,179
and the impact to the business so Health

456
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,640
Care is the orange Dot and that's kind

457
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,039
of a it's down a little bit lower and to

458
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,380
the left and when we got this data back

459
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,840
and we looked at this scatter plot we

460
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,940
said why would Healthcare be so much

461
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,200
lower

462
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,059
so we did a little bit of analysis on

463
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,760
this so he said you know Health Care

464
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,919
had to really pivot very quickly they

465
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,600
really had to modify their business

466
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,240
models during the pandemic Healthcare

467
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,700
also they were one of the earlier

468
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,940
targets for things such as ransomware so

469
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,340
Healthcare has largely learned how to

470
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,679
take care of a lot of these issues a

471
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,080
little bit sooner than some of the other

472
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,960
industry verticals that we surveyed so

473
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
Health Care is a little bit lower there

474
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,919
but still you know everybody's saying

475
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,260
that yeah we think the risk of an attack

476
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,620
is highly likely and we know that the

477
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,140
impact to the business is going to be

478
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,480
significant so that's the big takeaway

479
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,799
there that the line of business is tying

480
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,120
a Cyber attack to business outcomes so

481
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,460
that's a big big differentiator

482
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,799
now this particular table

483
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,580
is my favorite piece of data from 2022.

484
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,720
this is a heat map and what we found out

485
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,919
is that 74 of our survey respondents say

486
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,780
the the

487
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,080
say a compromise a security compromise

488
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,559
is very likely so the way you read this

489
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,120
heat map is on the y-axis we have the

490
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,520
different types of risks that people may

491
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,980
be concerned about so things such as

492
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,000
ransomware attack against endpoints

493
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,500
attacks against the workload at the

494
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,840
cloud Edge attacks against the radio

495
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,780
Access Network at the network Edge and

496
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,500
across the top on the x-axis we have the

497
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,720
different vertical markets that we

498
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,640
surveyed

499
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,720
so the gray bar is the total this is the

500
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,760
overall aggregate of what people are

501
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,880
concerned about so ransomware because of

502
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080
everything that has been happening with

503
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,059
ransomware ransomware very conveniently

504
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,980
cuts out the middleman everybody's

505
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,919
concerned about ransomware so overall

506
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,440
ransomware was number one with 66.1 so

507
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,380
66 percent of the survey respondents

508
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,039
saying ransomware is a top concern

509
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,020
but if we take a look at this and let's

510
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,820
say we're a manufacturing organization

511
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,039
so we go over to the manufacturing

512
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,740
column and the darker the blue the

513
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,539
higher the percentage the more concerned

514
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,059
people are about the risk so we go down

515
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,179
the manufacturing column we see that

516
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,940
71.3 percent or 71 percent of

517
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,919
manufacturing organizations who took

518
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,980
this survey are most concerned about

519
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,020
attacks against

520
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,480
user and endpoint devices

521
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,000
so you look at that and you say that

522
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,500
kind of makes sense for manufacturing

523
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,059
they're really concerned about those

524
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,200
endpoint devices likewise if we look at

525
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,120
healthcare for example

526
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,659
there are only 60 percent concerned

527
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,299
about endpoint attacks you go down

528
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,159
Health Care the biggest thing they're

529
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,220
concerned about 64 percent attacks

530
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,220
against the server and data within and

531
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,280
at the network Edge so regardless of

532
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
what as long as you're one of these six

533
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,539
industries that we surveyed you can use

534
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,600
this table to start the discussion to

535
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,980
continue the discussion in your

536
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,120
organization

537
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,419
so you can say you know I'm a healthcare

538
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,520
organization or I'm a retail

539
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,919
organization let's use this to figure

540
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,620
out if we're concerned about the same

541
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,440
thing as our peers are concerned about

542
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,720
and this is specifically written for the

543
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,539
edge but once I spend some time with

544
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,220
this you can probably look at this and

545
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,220
say this is true for any type of

546
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,240
application any type of

547
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,799
concern inside of one of these six

548
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,080
different industries that we surveyed

549
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,400
so

550
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,940
this is a to me I this is I'll give you

551
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,980
the link to the Pres to the report at

552
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,020
the end of this presentation this is on

553
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,020
page 17 of the presentation spend a lot

554
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,419
of time with this particular table this

555
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,419
to me is like I said the data of 2022.

556
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,480
because with this particular table

557
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,059
really shows us is that there is this

558
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,360
notion of shared responsibility and I've

559
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,980
heard it discussed here at the

560
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,960
conference a couple of times people

561
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,280
saying well you know your network

562
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,080
provider doesn't provide all the

563
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,419
security your cloud provider doesn't

564
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,400
provide all the security

565
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,820
and so back in our 2021 report we spent

566
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,640
a lot of time discussing this notion of

567
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,000
the shared responsibility model so if

568
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,980
you are using a network from a network

569
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,659
provider doesn't matter who it is

570
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,480
there's some inherent security built

571
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,179
into that network but you as the user of

572
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,659
that Network you have to then say I need

573
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:43,380
to protect my data my applications my

574
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,900
endpoints and the same thing I don't

575
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,940
have Cloud up here but the same thing

576
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,400
holds true for cloud you can use a

577
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
public Cloud name your favorite public

578
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,980
cloud provider you as the customer of

579
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,559
that public Cloud you have to protect

580
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,620
your data your applications and your

581
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,200
endpoints that are being connected to

582
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,360
that public cloud

583
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,220
the cloud provider is not going to

584
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,679
provide all the security for you so this

585
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,740
idea of a shared responsibility model is

586
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,539
really critical when you're thinking

587
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:17,580
about putting those applications out

588
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,260
there putting those new applications out

589
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,200
there what are you responsible for what

590
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,940
is your network provider responsible for

591
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,039
and what is your public cloud provider

592
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,659
responsible for

593
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,600
so that's just a little bit about the

594
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,120
movement to the edge and how people are

595
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,520
moving and where they are moving to the

596
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,720
edge

597
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,120
so the next big aha we took away from

598
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,299
the report is that hybrid is a reality

599
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,299
we still have a lot of on-premise items

600
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,820
as well as a lot of cloud items so it's

601
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,059
pretty much a 50 50 split

602
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,260
what this table shows us is that the

603
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,960
types of networks that people are

604
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,380
deploying with Edge use cases the

605
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,900
biggest type is private 5G cellular and

606
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,700
I don't think that was any surprise to

607
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,440
anybody when we received when we

608
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,720
reviewed this data it's probably not a

609
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,100
surprise to anybody when you're looking

610
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,799
at this data that's the biggest type of

611
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,110
network that people are going to use

612
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,580
[Music]

613
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,100
but this is really kind of surprising

614
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,380
this kind of gets into the whole sassy

615
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,260
concept sassy the secure access service

616
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,059
edge which is sd-wan zero trust casby

617
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,360
secure web Gateway and firewall those

618
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,020
five components make up sassy so what we

619
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,600
want them to find out here is what were

620
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,340
you doing what are these organizations

621
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,659
doing

622
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,200
with their security controls and their

623
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,600
Network functions are they combining

624
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,380
them together as sassy would suggest are

625
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,840
they using them still separately do they

626
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,000
have different network functions and

627
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,460
different cyber security controls so

628
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,740
what this data shows us is that it's

629
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,520
pretty much a 50 50 tie the dark blue

630
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,980
dots on the far right so the combined

631
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,620
cyber security and network functions in

632
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,580
the cloud such as sassy that's 51.3

633
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,279
percent we'll call that 51 percent

634
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,380
the combined cyber security and network

635
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,100
functions on-prem

636
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,740
51.9 so we'll call that 52 percent so

637
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,659
there's not much of a Delta between them

638
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,760
so that makes the case that

639
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,980
organizations are still

640
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,700
some on-prem some in the cloud so again

641
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,260
you can take this back to your own

642
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,080
organization and use it to determine

643
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,539
where you are on your journey or you

644
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,159
know if you're kind of on the Leading

645
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,620
Edge so to speak

646
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,220
the third big takeaway we had was that

647
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,279
organizations are moving to the edge and

648
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,799
they're trying to determine which cyber

649
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,320
security controls should go along with

650
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,200
them or which ones should just remain

651
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,419
with the Legacy systems that they have

652
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,460
to support

653
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,400
so this is a very very dense chart and

654
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,900
what I would suggest is that you

655
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,120
download the report and really take a

656
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,279
long look at this what we wanted to find

657
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,460
out here was what the preferred cyber

658
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,820
security controls were by Network types

659
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,039
and we looked at seven different network

660
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,520
types and as you can see here things

661
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,740
such as intrusion and threat detection

662
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,380
data leakage monitoring and device

663
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,140
authentication are the top controls the

664
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,260
top cyber security controls across all

665
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,960
seven of the network types so those are

666
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,700
the big cyber security controls that

667
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,679
people are saying yeah we're going to

668
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,140
take them with us as we move to the edge

669
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,760
so you can see the type of network

670
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,980
they're using and the controls that

671
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,240
they're using

672
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,700
this next slide

673
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,200
I don't want you to get confused and

674
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,000
think they're the same so these are the

675
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,059
preferred cyber security controls by

676
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,980
Network types

677
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,740
this next slide are the preferred cyber

678
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,919
security controls by components

679
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,260
the last slide our y-axis where the

680
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,919
network types this slide our y-axis are

681
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,200
the different uh the the different

682
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,000
components so things such as individual

683
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,539
use devices general purpose compute

684
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,539
devices and across the bottom are our

685
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,740
Network control

686
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,380
excuse me our network controls so

687
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,500
consistently network access control and

688
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,580
patching

689
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,520
are cited as the least

690
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,679
effective control that people are

691
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,700
looking at

692
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,200
so this is interesting and I want to

693
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,480
come back to patching because patching

694
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,700
is one of those things that I think kind

695
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,279
of gets a bad reputation but it's

696
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,559
interesting how people are perceiving it

697
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,200
so this slide really shows us the cyber

698
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,059
security controls perceived as having

699
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,419
the highest cost benefit so to the left

700
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,059
is negative to the right is positive so

701
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,140
the highest cost benefit people told us

702
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,600
firewall at the network Edge they told

703
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,960
us intrusion and threat detection big

704
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,659
cost benefit but if you look down to the

705
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,020
bottom the bottom two patching

706
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,620
and DDOS so we looked at this and we

707
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,860
said wow this is kind of interesting why

708
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,559
would those two be so low if you think

709
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,799
about DDOS it's kind of out of sight out

710
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,880
of mind

711
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,580
so people were saying well yeah DDOS

712
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,679
doesn't really help us that much until

713
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,200
you need it to help you so that's the

714
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,760
rationale that we took away with why

715
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,659
DDOS was ranked so low

716
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:48,120
patching was ranked low because a lot of

717
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,640
people what they told us in the comments

718
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,679
they said you know patching is something

719
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,020
that is very manual it's something that

720
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,480
we do manually it takes a lot of time

721
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,360
it's very reactive and as we move to the

722
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,360
edge we want to be more proactive we

723
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,279
want things to be more automated we

724
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,500
don't want to have to deal with

725
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,620
something being so slow so since then

726
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,840
we've seen a lot of automated patching

727
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,299
Solutions coming out there and a lot of

728
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,460
people are pivoting and gravitating to

729
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,039
these automated patching Solutions so

730
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,860
this perception of patching was a very

731
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,440
manual perception in this current piece

732
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,380
of data so those are the pers those are

733
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,200
the perceptions that people have of the

734
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,299
cyber security controls that are going

735
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,940
to have the most value to them as they

736
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,830
move to the edge

737
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,299
[Music]

738
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,840
so this slide talks about investment of

739
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,220
cyber security

740
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,460
and people always want to know how much

741
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,480
are my peers spending on security

742
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,020
so the way we read this slide is

743
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,380
the y-axis are are six different

744
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,740
verticals Healthcare Finance U.S public

745
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,980
sector Retail Energy and utilities and

746
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,600
Manufacturing

747
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,940
across the x-axis we have the different

748
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,980
columns or the different colors

749
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,899
the dark blue

750
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:16,860
the middle blue and then the gray so

751
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,779
what we're seeing here is that the sweet

752
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,840
spot for each of those six vertical

753
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,539
markets that we surveyed is somewhere

754
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:28,520
between 11 and 20 percent so for example

755
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,520
if you are in finance you go to the

756
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,110
finance

757
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,100
[Music]

758
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,039
bar chart the finance bar

759
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,880
45 of the people who took our survey who

760
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,460
say they are in financial services

761
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,740
say that they are spending somewhere

762
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,179
between 11 and 21

763
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:53,760
on security from their overall Edge

764
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,740
project budget

765
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,620
so this is very very encouraging as

766
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,200
someone who has spent a long time a long

767
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,539
part of my career talking about why

768
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,700
security needs to be budgeted for at the

769
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,980
beginning of a project this is very

770
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,559
encouraging so what they're saying is

771
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,679
our overall Edge budget we are planning

772
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,919
for security right up front right out of

773
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,740
the gate security is not an afterthought

774
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,620
and it's a hefty part of the budget so

775
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,000
for example if you look through here

776
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,840
Health Care 44 of Health Care

777
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,179
organizations are spending somewhere

778
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,600
between 11 and 20 percent of their

779
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,440
overall Edge project Budget on security

780
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,340
Finance 45 of them are spending

781
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,620
somewhere between 11 and 20 percent of

782
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,600
their overall Edge project Budget on

783
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,740
security

784
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,760
U.S public sector 55 of them are

785
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,679
spending somewhere between 11 and 20

786
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,899
percent of their overall Edge project

787
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,179
Budget on security

788
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:01,320
retail 51 are spending somewhere between

789
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,360
11 and 20 percent of their overall

790
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,360
project Budget on security energy and

791
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,139
utilities 55 of them are spending

792
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,500
somewhere between 11 and 20 percent of

793
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,099
their overall Edge Budget on security

794
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,219
and Manufacturing 50 percent of them are

795
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,619
spending somewhere between 11 and 20

796
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,659
percent of their overall Budget on

797
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,980
security

798
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,500
so this is encouraging because it helps

799
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,500
to one break down those silos two it

800
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,659
says security is part of the entire

801
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,179
ecosystem that we're building out and

802
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,460
our 2023 report which will be coming out

803
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,359
in January of 2023 we talk about the

804
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,060
edge ecosystem and we identify in there

805
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,980
where people are spending their money

806
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,300
are they spending their money on

807
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,980
application development are they

808
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,899
spending it on Research are they

809
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,239
spending it on networks so that I'll

810
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,500
just tease a little bit of the data

811
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,879
there so it'll be pretty interesting

812
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,560
data that will come out in January of

813
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,740
2023. so this is this is really nice

814
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,599
because it does show that those silos

815
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,839
are eroding and security has that full

816
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,040
seat at the table if you will

817
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,020
so what did we learn from this report we

818
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,380
learned that securing The Edge is really

819
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,560
a team effort it may be a Trope it may

820
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,000
be something that you said I've heard

821
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,160
this a million times but it really is

822
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,859
about the people the process and the

823
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,079
technology working with a trusted

824
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,180
advisor versus going alone and trying to

825
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,160
do everything yourself because it

826
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,320
becomes expensive and the stakes are

827
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,960
very very high there's a strong momentum

828
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,320
for the edge 75 percent of our survey

829
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,839
participants are moving to the edge and

830
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,420
we see that movement happening

831
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,000
continuously anecdotally I have done

832
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,440
nine webcasts on this particular report

833
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,260
this year and the first question I ask

834
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,400
is

835
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,619
where are you on your Edge Journey are

836
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:01,680
you in ideation proof of concept or in

837
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,260
full-scale production back in January

838
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,140
most people were in ideation or they

839
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,079
said we don't even know now the last one

840
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,300
I did was in the beginning of September

841
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,820
most people say we are proof of concept

842
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,700
or full-scale production so just in that

843
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,740
short period of time more and more

844
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,320
organizations have said we are moving to

845
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,579
the edge

846
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,020
so

847
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,700
figure out what you want your cyber

848
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,920
security controls to be as you move

849
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,560
forward which ones make sense from a

850
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,839
cost perspective which ones make sure

851
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,180
from a make sense from what you are

852
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,119
going to try to accomplish on the edge

853
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,540
and this is a big big opportunity to

854
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,160
collaborate this is a big big

855
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,680
opportunity to tear down those silos

856
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,900
that have been erected for the past 40

857
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,300
50 60 plus years inside of RIT

858
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,060
organizations and really collaborate to

859
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,040
deliver these strong business outcomes

860
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,960
that organizations really are looking

861
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,760
for

862
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,660
and so to get your copy of this report

863
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,899
just visit

864
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,760
cybersecurity.att.com you will have to

865
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,460
give us an email for the core report

866
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,040
what we also did this year is that we

867
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,800
took a look at all of the data that we

868
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,859
get so much Rich data back so we took a

869
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,260
look at all that interesting data that

870
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,640
we gathered and we said you know it'd be

871
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,500
really interesting to write some

872
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,200
industry vertical reports based upon

873
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,579
this data

874
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,820
so in 2022 we have also published in

875
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,740
addition to this core report on the left

876
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,800
hand side we've also published these

877
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,920
four vertical reports one on Health Care

878
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
one on U.S public sector sled State

879
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,260
local government and higher education

880
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,900
one on manufacturing and one on energy

881
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,260
and utilities so please visit

882
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,240
cybersecurity.com

00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,500
cybersecurity.att.com and download your

884
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,800
reports today so Edge use cases in

885
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,940
production

886
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,740
so

887
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,960
um

888
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,180
Finance concierge services and real-time

889
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,339
fraud detection the real-time fraud

890
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,020
detection is the really interesting one

891
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,480
I think that a lot of credit card

892
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,700
companies for example they have that

893
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,520
attached to the credit card what or what

894
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,079
finance companies told us they wanted to

895
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,400
do was they wanted to build real-time

896
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,260
fraud detection into everything they

897
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,640
were doing so they were using Edge

898
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,980
networks for that

899
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,339
um U.S public sector the public safety

900
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,619
example that I gave where they're trying

901
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,240
to identify if somebody calls and said

902
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,400
hey I heard a loud noise wanting to make

903
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,619
sure it's not a gunshot versus noise

904
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,020
from a loud party what they're doing is

905
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,880
a lot of public sector organizations are

906
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,160
using artificial intelligence to enrich

907
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,700
a lot of that data that comes through

908
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,020
if you know anything about what's going

909
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,859
on with 9-1-1 9-1-1 is now going to sort

910
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:55,859
of uh um a video based audio based type

911
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,619
of reporting system so somebody may be

912
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:01,020
able to record that noise and then when

913
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,780
they call up the 911 operator they can

914
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,300
say here's the noise that I heard and

915
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,560
there might be enough artificial

916
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,839
intelligence in the system to say that

917
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,760
is just a loud noise don't be concerned

918
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,280
or it could be something else so then

919
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,520
they know the proper team to deploy

920
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,500
um

921
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,119
manufacturing visual Quality Inspection

922
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,700
on the assembly line a lot of the big

923
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,680
big manufacturers started doing this

924
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,800
several years ago huge carb manufacturer

925
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,920
in Dearborn Michigan I happen to be able

926
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,740
to visit that that that manufacturing

927
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,660
facility once upon a time in a previous

928
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,400
career and if you watch them create

929
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,740
these vehicles these trucks that they're

930
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,079
creating on this assembly line it's a

931
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,660
three-dimensional assembly line and

932
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,240
before the vehicle gets on the assembly

933
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,180
line the doors the tailgate they are

934
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,400
assigned to that particular vehicle

935
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,460
and as the as the vehicle moves through

936
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,740
the assembly line the doors the tailgate

937
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,440
there on an overhead track matching the

938
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,760
body of the truck

939
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,700
and so let's say they're going along the

940
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,680
assembly line and all of a sudden they

941
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,180
realize oh the door handle is off by

942
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,820
five degrees they can stop the

943
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,460
production line right there and

944
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,800
remediate that defect because of the

945
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,599
cameras and the sensors that they're

946
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,420
using on that assembly line and what

947
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,240
they can also do is they can go back and

948
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,780
they can inspect and say oh the defect

949
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,780
was introduced three vehicles ago so

950
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,700
let's bring these vehicles back on the

951
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,060
assembly line and fix that defect so

952
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,400
before that it was people were

953
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,619
eyeballing the the handle for example

954
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,660
and saying yeah that looks pretty good

955
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,820
and then by the time you kind of get

956
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,619
those trucks out there maybe that handle

957
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,839
determines that oh there needs to be a

958
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,940
recall on that particular vehicle and so

959
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,980
on so that's the real-time visual

960
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,480
inspection

961
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,000
um the other big one that was ranked

962
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
very highly was retail so loss

963
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
prevention so again in a physical brick

964
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,280
and mortar environment having cameras

965
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,900
sensors set up so you can understand

966
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,000
what people are taking off the shelves

967
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,800
what are they walking out of the store

968
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,680
with what has actually been purchased

969
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,140
what has not been purchased

970
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,380
um if you have ever been to Seattle or

971
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,720
San Francisco I don't have my badge on

972
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,900
but the the lanyard sponsor they have a

973
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,640
really awesome store there Amazon go

974
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,820
stores and Amazon ghost stores you scan

975
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,800
your barcode to get in it's attached to

976
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,920
a credit card and you go in there and

977
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,020
you can take anything you want off the

978
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,900
shelves and you walk out with it and

979
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,820
when you go there you sit outside and

980
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,800
you watch people and it looks they

981
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,300
everybody comes out and they're happy

982
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,920
they look as though they are getting

983
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,540
away with something you know so

984
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,820
everybody is going in there and buying a

985
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,680
bottle of water or a soda a bag of chips

986
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,900
in a candy bar and it is just the most

987
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,240
most impressive thing you will see in

988
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,980
terms of

989
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,920
using cameras and sensors in a retail

990
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,900
setting so cameras and sensors in a

991
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,940
retail setting are going to be very very

992
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,240
powerful very popular for retail Edge

993
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,119
use cases in terms of looking at loss

994
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,339
prevention also in a warehouse they can

995
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:21,780
look at it in a warehouse on loss

996
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,880
prevention as well what is the breakage

997
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,320
of something you know if something is

998
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,240
too high up for something to pick for a

999
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,880
human to pick or for a robot to pick is

1000
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,320
something dropping and breaking at a

1001
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,180
more frequent rate so it's about

1002
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,880
delivering these good and solid business

1003
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,460
outcomes from The Edge and I mentioned

1004
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,859
the the telemedicine one so those are

1005
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,660
some of the big examples and when you

1006
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,880
download the report you'll see that in

1007
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,060
the report we have big spreads on each

1008
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,160
of these vertical Industries and the key

1009
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,079
takeaways from them what we're doing for

1010
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,960
our 2023 report is that we're writing

1011
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,119
sample use cases for each of the

1012
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,800
vertical markets that we're surveying as

1013
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,440
well for our 2023 report we added

1014
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,060
Transportation as the seventh vertical

1015
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,920
market so we're writing those use case

1016
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,619
is about what the problem was what the

1017
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,900
business problem was and then how it was

1018
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,180
resolved and what the business outcome

1019
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,240
was and why that was so important thank

1020
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,359
