[Music]

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,520
[Music]

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,020
[Music]

6
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,340
welcome everybody thanks for having me

7
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,620
for the fifth time uh she mentioned

8
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,940
we're going to be talking about building

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,160
a software supply chain security team

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,559
today uh can everybody hear me okay I

11
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,360
hate carrying a microphone okay I'm

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,299
really loud too so all right agenda for

13
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,140
today

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,460
um you don't care about that we're going

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,040
to get right into it so introduction a

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,540
little bit about me like I already said

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,060
I've been here five times before

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,759
um I have spent the last seven eight

19
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,740
something years of my career being an

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,320
appsec consultant and uh have done what

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,700
the Consultants say going back to

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,720
Industry

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,420
um now I work for a cryptocurrency

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,939
exchange where I've spent the last year

25
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,340
building a supply chain security team

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,560
from the ground up I've been in I.T

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,659
something like 20 years 10 years of that

28
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,759
appsec 20 plus years of development

29
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,380
experience because I've done it since

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,479
middle school seven years of Consulting

31
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,280
a year in crypto and a year in supply

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,920
chain security so buzzword Bingo I've

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,200
been all over the place a bit about me

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,299
I'm getting ready to celebrate my 20th

35
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,220
wedding anniversary pretty excited about

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,560
that my kids are all getting older

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,360
Beard's getting grayer my oldest is

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,920
about to go to college I like to play

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,619
guitar kite hike camp board game and

40
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,960
video game

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,940
so why am I here today

42
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,440
um I just originally got the idea for

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,739
this talk just because so uh my boss the

44
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,260
chief security officer of bullish his

45
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,599
previous consultant as well and so we

46
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,640
kind of had this big idea if everybody's

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
talking about s-bombs we know supply

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,420
chain security is going to just

49
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,400
absolutely explode

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,379
but nobody's really doing anything about

51
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,480
it so how about we be one of the first

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,940
actually build a supply chain security

53
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,760
team take that consult mindset and try

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,120
to do what we think is is right so

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,860
um Point here everybody's talking about

56
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,780
supply chain security I don't think

57
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,000
anybody's doing a darn thing about it

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
and hopefully some of you all will

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,660
disagree with that

60
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,000
so case in point I went to RSA earlier

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,379
this year

62
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,319
um every single block of talks that they

63
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,840
had at RSA there was a supply chain talk

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,180
every single one of them I checked on

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,760
Monday there were 29 presentations which

66
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,680
were almost as much as ransomware and we

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,360
know how many ransomware talks there are

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,420
at RSA pretty much all of them

69
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,099
um a lot of them were talking about

70
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,800
s-bumps just like here right I counted

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,739
six supply chain talks on the agenda

72
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,659
this year for last con up from I think

73
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,540
zero last year so you know getting a lot

74
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,239
of attention but at RSA I attended every

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,760
one of those talks none of them talked

76
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
about the how right they all talked

77
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
about how cool s-bombs are and how

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,040
everybody needs to do them and how Biden

79
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,959
says you're going to have to

80
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,580
um not one of them told you how to

81
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,920
generate an s-bomb and then most of the

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
rest were talking about third party risk

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,879
management and they were just trying to

84
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,739
give it a sexy title like supply chain

85
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,060
security

86
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,340
so I need a lot of help with this I'm

87
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,019
building this from the ground up so I'm

88
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,760
like okay well I'll go hit the the

89
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,739
vendor show floor at RSA right like

90
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,959
every security vendor known to man is

91
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,920
there

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,920
zero of them we're focused on supply

93
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,980
chain there was not one supply chain or

94
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,220
s-bomb type of vendor out there not one

95
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,680
vendor was even talking about s-bombs

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,560
the closest I could find was our ska

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,360
vendors doing the software composition

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,599
analysis which I'm sure many of you

99
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,660
probably have experience with today

100
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,519
feel free to challenge me as far as I've

101
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,079
seen not one of them truly supports

102
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,139
s-bumps all of them generate an

103
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,660
inventory report inside of their tool

104
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,139
and then they output that into an s-bomb

105
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,240
format that generally doesn't actually

106
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,639
meet the specification of the s-bumps

107
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,860
but we'll talk about that more later and

108
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,020
so in the end I couldn't find a single

109
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,419
vendor that could help me solve any of

110
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,699
my supply chain related problems so

111
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,460
pretty pretty big gap there when we look

112
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,680
at how much we're hearing about supply

113
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,500
chain s-bombs whatever and start looking

114
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,280
for people to try to help us

115
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,800
foreign so as I mentioned I've spent the

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,020
last year building the supply chain

117
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,120
security program

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,220
so when we first walked into this we

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,740
kind of had to decide okay well what is

120
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,380
supply chain security is it is it

121
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,020
s-bombs is it a piece of the appsec

122
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,360
program what does it really look like

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,540
and so we went in on day one and

124
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,180
basically defined what we saw as supply

125
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,460
chain security to start building our

126
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,800
program around it and this is basically

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,080
it this is really our pillars of supply

128
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
chain security at the organization where

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,960
I work

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,940
so on the left we've got open source

131
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,460
third-party libraries this is everything

132
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,860
you probably expect that this is right

133
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,720
this is looking at you know all of our

134
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,280
open source that's looking at our

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,199
package managers how we bring the open

136
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,240
source in the software composition

137
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,820
analysis tools approval processes

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,039
artifact storage

139
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,560
um looking for log4 Shell I've heard

140
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,020
that a hundred times today Apache

141
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,240
Commons last week whatever one's going

142
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,620
to come out today while I'm here

143
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,100
probably finding all of those

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,660
um our third party software right open

145
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,699
source is a big piece of it but there's

146
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,380
also a lot of software that's closed

147
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,740
Source or that we purchase so anytime

148
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,419
something goes through our procurement

149
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,880
process that also comes to supply chain

150
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,199
security

151
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,539
um now we're not doing GRC we're not

152
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,479
doing tprm you know we're doing you know

153
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,819
third-party security assessments things

154
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,039
of that nature making sure the software

155
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,380
that people are trying to buy meets the

156
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,780
security requirements to be within our

157
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,639
organization

158
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,819
we look at all of our suppliers right so

159
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,139
you know this is getting back to things

160
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,600
like Target right you know Target was

161
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,060
breached because you know an HVAC vendor

162
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,220
was breached and that HVAC vendor had

163
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,680
access into the target Network so what

164
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,440
security controls do our suppliers have

165
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,419
in place to prevent us from being

166
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,060
breached as a result of Their Own

167
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,860
misdoings

168
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,900
and then finally my team's responsible

169
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,300
for the security of our software Factory

170
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,880
so you know really all of the tools that

171
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,620
are used in the build and deploy

172
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,120
processes

173
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,440
um you know for our source code so

174
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
that's everything from source code

175
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,240
management to orchestration to artifact

176
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,780
storage CI CD all of that you know we're

177
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,520
in charge of the security of that so we

178
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,560
work really closely with our devops

179
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,720
teams and make sure that we're hardening

180
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,340
all of those systems so that way we

181
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,840
don't become a solar winds

182
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,539
all right so let's break that down a

183
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,099
little bit further I'm not going to read

184
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,440
all of these uh bullet points it sits a

185
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,880
lot of words but you know you can read

186
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,039
them while I talk so but if we take

187
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,599
those pillars and we kind of break them

188
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,520
down into what it is we actually do

189
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,500
right so this is kind of going from the

190
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,060
high level you know here's the four key

191
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,800
pillars of what makes up supply chain

192
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,000
two here is what my team does on a daily

193
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,180
basis right so one is we maintain our

194
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,580
internal software bill of materials and

195
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,599
here in a minute we're going to talk

196
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,460
about observations and Lessons Learned

197
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,960
and things like that and we'll talk

198
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,380
about how much s-bombs actually suck

199
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,000
um but you know we're responsible for

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,479
generating and updating those s-bumps

201
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,400
and then also generating them for

202
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,380
external distribution so if somebody

203
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,479
wants to come and use our crypto

204
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,919
exchange and they say hey can you give

205
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,139
us an s-bomb you know we can be you know

206
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,460
one of the first companies in the world

207
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,280
it seems like to say here you go here's

208
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,620
our s-bomb

209
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,660
uh we look at our dependencies for known

210
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,699
vulnerabilities so again this is just

211
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,520
software composition analysis we're not

212
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,140
um you know Reinventing the will or

213
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,820
anything here right you know and one of

214
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,140
the big observations that I'll talk

215
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,059
about is this kind of gets back to the

216
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,159
same appsec messaging that you know

217
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,500
we've been preaching for many many many

218
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,660
many years right I think I talked last

219
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,640
year about how much I hate shift left

220
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,500
and shift left really sucks and we're

221
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
doing it all wrong

222
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
um of you know I've kind of naively have

223
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,019
thought that we've solved some problems

224
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,300
but really Jeff Williams is right

225
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,800
um and we can't even really do software

226
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,740
composition analysis good and we're just

227
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,720
missing a lot of just best practices and

228
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,339
the tools don't work as good as

229
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,740
personally even years in appsec I would

230
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,720
have thought that they did

231
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,040
um and then we work closely with our

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,800
engineering teams for remediation

233
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,720
and we Define leading practices for

234
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,640
using software libraries open source or

235
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,060
otherwise so I maintain a set of um you

236
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,860
know open source standards so that way

237
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,899
anytime our developers want to use an

238
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,700
open source Library there's a set of

239
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,440
published standards that they have to

240
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,839
follow that outline minimum criteria you

241
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,000
know is it well maintained you know was

242
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,279
there uh known Russian hacker that

243
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,399
contributed to the repo a year ago you

244
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
know are there known vulnerabilities in

245
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,420
it and things of that nature in a lot of

246
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,880
cases we also create wrappers you know

247
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,339
so that way if we don't need say a full

248
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,040
open source package we can just take the

249
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,080
pieces that we need Fork it throw some

250
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,360
wrappers around it and only expose the

251
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,040
methods and things that we actually need

252
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,200
to use as opposed to using the entire

253
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,500
Library

254
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,060
all right so on to the next pillar

255
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,760
maintain supplier software bill of

256
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,279
materials so how many of you ask your

257
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,720
suppliers for an s-bomb today

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,380
nobody okay

259
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,940
that doesn't surprise me I expected I'd

260
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,980
get one or two but um

261
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,019
I have been asking my suppliers for

262
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,360
s-bombs for over a year now

263
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,459
I have received I think I say in the

264
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,920
presentation zero I've actually received

265
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,100
one and that's because I purchased a

266
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,320
tool that I'd be happy to talk about not

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,620
in this talk for s-bomb governance and

268
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,080
management and that supplier did give me

269
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,720
their s-bomb

270
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,880
no other organization has and this is

271
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
everything from you know other crypto

272
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
Solutions custodial Solutions technology

273
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,980
companies

274
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,240
um you know one of the biggest

275
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,300
technology companies that everyone in

276
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,459
here has has heard of it starts with an

277
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,579
O and rhymes with some other words I

278
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,320
asked that asked them for an s-bomb at a

279
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,899
threat model and uh they actually told

280
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,000
me that is proprietary we will not give

281
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
you an s-bomb we will never give you an

282
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,100
s-bomb don't ask us again and this was

283
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,440
after the executive order was published

284
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,899
right so despite what many of us might

285
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,279
think or what we're hearing in all of

286
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,740
these talks this is not getting adopted

287
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,660
today

288
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,579
um and I try to partner closely with our

289
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,320
suppliers to maintain and get those

290
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,820
s-bombs so

291
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,019
um you know when they don't give them to

292
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,579
us I try to work with them try to help

293
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,500
them generate them try to educate them

294
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,700
so that way they can meet our

295
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,019
requirements

296
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,399
um because here in the very near future

297
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,320
it will be a requirement to actually

298
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,839
partner with us as an organization

299
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,220
um if you don't have an s-bomb you

300
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,640
likely will not do business with us

301
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,680
and then develop leading practices and

302
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
configuration for third-party vendor

303
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,339
software and SAS products that's a

304
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,200
mouthful basically what that means is

305
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,820
whenever we buy software or some

306
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,980
solution we try our best to harden it

307
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,200
and we document it we we create we

308
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,480
create a Wiki or whatever it might be we

309
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,160
take the configuration of that product

310
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,740
we Harden it we document all of the

311
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,959
configuration settings and then we

312
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,300
monitor it right so regardless of

313
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,540
whether that's a cloud provider or a

314
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,000
plug-in for slack or whatever it may be

315
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
we monitor what those security

316
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,260
configurations are so that way if

317
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,360
somebody changes those configurations so

318
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,339
that they're no longer best practice you

319
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,440
know we can identify who did that when

320
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,660
and go back and make sure that it meets

321
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,420
the configuration

322
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,860
one of our big initiatives for next year

323
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,019
is to automate that which kind of sounds

324
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,839
like an impossible task right now but

325
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,220
you know we'll see how that goes because

326
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,320
today it's largely documentation based

327
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,959
but ideally there'd be some way for us

328
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,440
to just scrape that configuration and

329
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,300
then have some sort of job that monitors

330
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,220
it and notifies us anytime there's a

331
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,339
change

332
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,100
um

333
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,440
we Define the ownership for all of our

334
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,060
third party stuff so whenever again

335
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,399
anything comes in we don't do this for

336
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,500
like every open source library but you

337
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,800
know if it was an open source product so

338
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,620
say rabbitmq right something big like

339
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,079
that's a good example or anything that

340
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,360
we procure we require that a racy chart

341
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,700
gets created you know so that way we

342
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,980
have defined ownership for whatever that

343
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,139
solution is and we can go out into the

344
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,940
organization whenever we have questions

345
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,800
or something goes wrong or we need to

346
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,720
integrate with another tool then we have

347
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,540
somebody who does own that

348
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,920
um I think I feel like most companies do

349
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,480
a pretty good job of doing that at a

350
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,820
process level or for things that they

351
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,980
create internal but it's often an

352
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,120
oversight for a third party

353
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,000
then finally you know getting into the

354
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,519
software Factory so as I said earlier we

355
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,620
partner with our devops teams you know

356
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,720
we constantly look at our build and

357
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,060
deploy technology stack and basically

358
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,800
figure out how to secure it right you

359
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,060
know again everybody's talking about

360
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,579
supply chain attacks you know solarwinds

361
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,260
is mentioned about twice in every single

362
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,459
talk

363
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,240
um

364
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,760
but how do you actually Harden your your

365
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,860
software Factory right there's not

366
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,120
really at least that I've found there's

367
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,399
not a guide that you can just go out

368
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,519
there and download right uh go to GitHub

369
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,040
and ask them for hardening guidelines

370
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,139
for GitHub

371
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,480
um spoiler they don't have one

372
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,920
um so you kind of have to figure that

373
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,899
out on your own actually I just asked

374
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,639
them on Monday

375
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,339
um so they still don't have it and so

376
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,019
what a lot of people did you know in my

377
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,760
prior life life is they would hire

378
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,220
Consultants like us to come out and take

379
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,560
a look at you know their their Jenkins

380
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,019
or you know whatever other horrible

381
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,360
systems because they all suck um you

382
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,519
know to look at and ask us for guidance

383
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,920
on how to harden them and ultimately we

384
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,779
find all sorts of horrible things right

385
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,459
you know you've got Secrets stored in

386
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,079
the system and oh hey you can just

387
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,660
output those in a job to a text file and

388
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,060
get all the secrets out of your CI

389
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,519
system the developers can just delete

390
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,920
their pipeline.yaml file and just com

391
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,540
bypass all of these secure already

392
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,519
controls that you built into your CI

393
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,920
system the list goes on and on and on

394
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,920
and on so we do our best to review and

395
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,899
document those configurations and make

396
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,260
sure they're not bypassable

397
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,660
we Implement security gates to the tool

398
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,160
chain we'll talk a little bit more about

399
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,720
that

400
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,920
um

401
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,660
and then finally over on container

402
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,639
security I won't talk about that one too

403
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,380
much because my team doesn't care a

404
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,899
whole lot about container security that

405
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,360
follows falls into more of our security

406
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,060
engineering team at my org but what I do

407
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,519
care about is the open source packages

408
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,220
that are in our containers so we'll talk

409
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,800
about that with the s-bombs too but you

410
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,120
know this kind of gets us to that next

411
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,860
level of

412
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,899
um you know I think it was somebody was

413
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,040
saying earlier it might have been Dan

414
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,660
right you know who cares about an open

415
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,339
source vulnerability if you're not

416
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,600
actually running it not actually

417
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,579
deploying it right you know if you're

418
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,380
just scanning your open source you're

419
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,060
probably getting all of your developer

420
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,160
dependencies in there but also what

421
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,139
about your OS dependencies so you know

422
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,180
once you're out there runtime deployed

423
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,560
in a container or however you're

424
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,120
deploying today

425
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,680
um you know what about all of those

426
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,399
those Debian repos and packages and all

427
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,899
of those type of things right those are

428
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,880
things we need visibility into as well

429
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,260
so really right it's more than just

430
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,959
s-bumps right this is an entire program

431
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,220
so I want to talk a little bit about

432
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,620
where we started and then we'll kind of

433
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,779
circle back and I'll share a lot of just

434
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,300
Lessons Learned and challenges and

435
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,579
really uh this probably paints a pretty

436
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,160
Rosy picture so far I'm gonna destroy

437
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,959
that Rosy picture here here in a minute

438
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,779
so um our team size so again we're a

439
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,519
supply chain security team right it's

440
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,339
not you know some poor person on the

441
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,440
appsec team that we said we need to do

442
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,079
s-bombs now and so now we have you know

443
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,940
this guy sitting in the corner where 10

444
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,220
of his time is dedicated to supply chain

445
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,920
security or something like that

446
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,240
um right and I think that was in Dan's

447
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,339
talk earlier right it was something what

448
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,679
five to ten percent of appsec budgets is

449
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,359
going to be going towards supply chain

450
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,520
why does it need to be the appsec budget

451
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,140
right why shouldn't it be the cyber

452
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,419
security budget and that's exactly the

453
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,119
approach that we've taken so um in our

454
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,619
case you know being a crypto exchange

455
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,959
right we follow we we follow the sun in

456
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,819
our operating bottle so we've got

457
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,819
24-hour support so my supply chain team

458
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,700
is three of us so I'm in the U.S and I

459
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,559
lead the team and then I have two team

460
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,780
members that are based in Singapore

461
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,720
again providing 24-hour support and we

462
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,220
have room to grow right with all of

463
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,900
these responsibilities

464
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,760
um I could double the size of my team

465
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,280
and we would still have work to do right

466
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,900
so you know if you're trying to tackle

467
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,140
all of this again with some person on

468
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,820
your appsec team that's spending five

469
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,100
percent on this you're probably not

470
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,740
going to get very far

471
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,419
um we've been doing this a bit over a

472
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,340
year at this point and our team is

473
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,080
actually a split off from the GRC team

474
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,559
so mid last year the GRC lead left our

475
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,780
organization and our CSO made the

476
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,520
decision uh that would be a really good

477
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,100
time to actually split the org and so

478
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,320
what he did was instead of just hiring a

479
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,500
new GRC lead he spun off a separate GRC

480
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,960
team in a supply chain security team and

481
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,520
then that's when he hired me to kind of

482
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,440
come in and figure out how to solve that

483
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
problem but we started off with um you

484
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,480
know not even really s-poms right we

485
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,799
started off with third-party security

486
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
assessments so taking a look at our

487
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
third party and you know the things that

488
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,620
are coming in through your procurement

489
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,140
or other policy exceptions and doing

490
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,299
Security reviews on them right so things

491
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,240
like you know do you just let anybody

492
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,360
install whatever browser extension they

493
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,220
want right it's

494
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,500
most places probably do people can just

495
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,480
freely download browser extensions what

496
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,299
about slack plugins right we talk about

497
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,340
a lot of really really really important

498
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,620
things in slack uh right but then we

499
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,179
just take a plug-in and we throw it in

500
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,740
there and that can be sending actually

501
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,799
most of those slack plugins

502
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,660
um will provide you know read-only

503
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,900
access to your messages to whomever is

504
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,880
providing that plugin for you right are

505
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,620
you taking a look at those

506
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,000
um even if it's something open source

507
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,919
are you reviewing the open source source

508
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,500
code and checking for any sort of data

509
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,419
exfiltration any data leaving your

510
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,539
organization and going out to who knows

511
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,799
where

512
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,360
um you know and that none of that's even

513
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,980
touching the things that we're actually

514
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,100
buying and doing security assessments of

515
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,140
uh the configuration reviews was another

516
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,380
easy one right we're Cloud first so we

517
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,900
use a lot of cloud Solutions so making

518
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,000
sure all of those have

519
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,140
um you know all of the appropriate

520
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,940
security controls in place you know

521
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,620
working with the team partnering with

522
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,900
the teams as they're implementing those

523
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,700
Solutions and you know instead of just

524
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,440
saying okay cool it's a Cloud solution

525
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,360
you're approved and you can buy it and

526
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,860
you're good now right we continue

527
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,960
working with them from that point on to

528
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,059
document the configuration make sure

529
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,039
they're setting up users right that they

530
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,660
don't have a hundred thousand admins

531
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,940
that can do anything that we're not

532
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,340
turning on silly options like allow the

533
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,440
vendor access into that particular

534
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,140
product things like that

535
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,900
um establish the open source program we

536
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,059
defined the program roadmap and then we

537
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,620
redefined it and we redefined it we

538
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,840
redefined it because again we're making

539
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,940
this up as we go and at this point I've

540
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,740
probably redefined what the supply chain

541
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,900
security team looks like about four

542
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,460
times now

543
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,260
um you know for again reasons we'll talk

544
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,120
about in a minute and I've also done a

545
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,460
lot of speaking within industry analyst

546
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,260
um which has yielded some interesting

547
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,600
results

548
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
all right so let's talk about my key

549
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,140
observations

550
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,820
um this is where we start getting a

551
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,500
little bit sadder

552
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,419
so all everybody talks about is s bombs

553
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,740
right I think I've said that a few times

554
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,140
now what nobody has probably told you

555
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,940
unless you've tried this on your own is

556
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,419
s-bombs are really freaking hard

557
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:58,740
um how many of you have tried to

558
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,620
generate an s-bomb before

559
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,200
a few hands um

560
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,880
was it was it easy was it just for a

561
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,760
single repo or

562
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,400
share some thoughts with me

563
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,380
at what level are you talking about

564
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,480
restaurant at the final level that

565
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
report compiled or after compiled just

566
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,799
the libraries

567
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,559
that's my second point so uh it's a

568
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,900
valid question uh take pick your pick

569
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,340
your favorite

570
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,000
okay

571
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,099
[Music]

572
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,780
anybody else

573
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,280
good

574
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
um

575
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,740
so I use our own tool or our NCAA tool

576
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,760
and

577
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,440
licensed for it which gives me the

578
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,620
ability to generate against volumes

579
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,418
and it does use the um

580
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,960
okay

581
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,880
all right okay

582
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,100
cool I come from aspect security so I

583
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,380
spent many years working with Jeff so uh

584
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,299
I share some of his thoughts and

585
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,360
disagree with him on others so some of

586
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,280
my thoughts here are

587
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,620
and as I mentioned at RSA

588
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,480
there are

589
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,940
basically zero tools to help you with

590
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,919
this problem right if you go out and you

591
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,360
say well for one you got to figure out

592
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,740
what specification you want to follow

593
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,720
first right everybody in this room is

594
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,360
probably going to tell you Cyclone DX

595
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,039
um but you know then everybody's also

596
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,360
going to tell you about dependency track

597
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,580
what they also don't tell you is that a

598
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,900
lot of the tools out there will only

599
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,000
generate spdx so like some of your

600
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,860
software composition analysis vendors

601
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,320
will only do spdx and that was

602
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,179
intentionally removed from dependency

603
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,500
track

604
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,179
um several versions ago so if you want

605
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,799
to use dependency track

606
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,600
well you better make sure that if your

607
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,460
vendors do start actually ever giving us

608
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,980
bombs that they give you a cyclone DX

609
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,179
and that it conforms to the

610
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,919
specification if you go out to the

611
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,900
Cyclone DX website

612
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,580
gives you probably about a hundred

613
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,100
different open source tools that are in

614
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,260
various states of maintainability to

615
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,820
generate these for you and then you got

616
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,820
to figure it out from there right I'm I

617
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,400
generate code in multiple Tech Stacks

618
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,740
right we've got Gradle we've got npm

619
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,140
we've got Java we've got JavaScript well

620
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,419
if you look at Cyclone DX each one of

621
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,940
those is like a different tool and then

622
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,900
you've got to figure out how to plug

623
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,340
them in most of them want you to put

624
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,900
that into the source code repository

625
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,179
right which then what if my developers

626
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,700
go in there and just delete that item

627
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,380
out of the build Gradle or something

628
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,000
like that and all of a sudden I'm not

629
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
getting an s-bomb right it's really

630
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,960
really difficult to generate an

631
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,780
end-to-end s-bomb so you know and from

632
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,580
my perspective my final product right

633
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,460
it's a crypto exchange it's very very

634
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,559
modern we don't have mono reposts and

635
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,299
things like that right we're deploying

636
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,580
containers to kubernetes so I've got

637
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,500
about 60 containers that are deploying

638
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,179
on a release

639
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,299
um you know some number of VMS you know

640
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,820
hsms and things like that because we're

641
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,280
a crypto company I've got blockchain

642
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,980
architecture I've got smart contracts

643
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,400
and C plus plus code so even though I'm

644
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,320
might be able to get a tool or you know

645
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,820
maybe you know contrast or pick on

646
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,039
contrast for a second you know might be

647
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,659
able to scan a repo and give me that

648
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,820
output but you know how do I get it to

649
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,840
give it to me for 60 containers and 10

650
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,440
VMS and then 20 repos that get deployed

651
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,539
in some other way and then how do I put

652
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,820
all of that together into one because if

653
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,620
somebody comes to me and says give me

654
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,780
your s-bomb I can't give them 100

655
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,880
different s-bombs I got to give them one

656
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,860
right so how do I get all of that into

657
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,679
one that's a really difficult problem

658
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
there's no best practices yet on where

659
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,220
to generate them it's just like like you

660
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,780
said right do we generate them out of

661
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,039
the containers do we get it out of the

662
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,299
code do we get it out of the build

663
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:52,320
system

664
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,480
where do we get it from where do we

665
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,059
start right you know sisa I think will

666
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,280
tell you probably all three of those

667
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,419
um but you've you've got to start

668
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,679
somewhere

669
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,720
and in my case where I started was with

670
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,940
the containers honestly

671
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,159
um because I care about what's running

672
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,799
and so you know what I do is actually

673
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,679
part of our deployment process I

674
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,000
actually pull

675
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,919
um all of the containers out of our

676
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,020
kubernetes cluster that are running in

677
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,000
our test environment during the deploy

678
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,779
and then I run some open one open source

679
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,700
tool on them

680
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,400
um to generate the output and then I

681
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,020
actually take that and I send that off

682
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,059
to another tool for the governance and

683
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,039
management and then that way I get

684
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,720
what's actually running I don't have to

685
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,179
worry about developer dependencies I get

686
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,580
all of the OS runtime dependencies and

687
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,460
all of that good stuff too

688
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,980
um tooling is nascent and immature again

689
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,840
you know if you're a vendor

690
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,100
this this is a completely empty space

691
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,299
um that's just Rife with with

692
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,220
opportunity

693
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,779
um right if you can figure out how to

694
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,340
make a solution that will generate us

695
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,080
bombs for people and give them an

696
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,020
end-to-end holistic s-bomb and do it for

697
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,820
All Tech Stacks

698
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,340
um everybody's going to need your tool

699
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,360
within the next year so um you give me

700
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,520
some royalties

701
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,740
um the tools that we do have today most

702
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,779
of them don't conform to specifications

703
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,260
Cyclone DX is not a tool right I've had

704
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,179
multiple software composition analysis

705
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,260
vendors

706
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,419
um tell me that Cyclone DX is a tool

707
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,299
right it's a specification it's it's a

708
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,120
document format basically at the end of

709
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,820
the day the same is true of spdx and the

710
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,460
other common formats for s-bombs so when

711
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,020
you do start thinking about these other

712
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,020
tools like if you can generate an s-bomb

713
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,460
where are you going to put it right

714
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,559
that's that's another problem

715
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,179
um there are a couple Tools in that

716
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,059
space that are actually pretty decent

717
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,240
but your s-bomb typically has to conform

718
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,059
to the specification because it has to

719
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,520
validate before it will upload you know

720
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,620
if you go to Cyclone DX for example they

721
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,600
have a validator on their website you

722
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,520
can take the the file you can put it

723
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,140
through that validator and it will say

724
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,980
this is a valid s-bomb or it is not

725
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,520
all of those tools that I have used

726
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,860
generate an invalid s-bomb

727
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,159
right so that's another problem so we

728
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,419
they have to conform to the

729
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:22,919
specification

730
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,020
we've got few tools for governance and

731
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,419
management right so I've asked this if

732
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:28,980
actually I did ask this to all of the

733
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,020
software composition analysis vendors at

734
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,460
RSA

735
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,140
um so for one

736
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,640
their tools

737
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,100
this is my wording don't do s-bombs

738
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,559
right they say they do really what they

739
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,480
do is they generate an inventory report

740
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,120
inside of the solution then most of them

741
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,039
have written some hack job python or

742
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,659
whatever that you go download and run

743
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,640
and then it basically takes that

744
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,880
inventory report and it outputs it as an

745
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,820
s-bomb that doesn't conform to the

746
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,200
specifications and then we're back to

747
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,120
that problem right but then where do you

748
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,960
put it

749
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,159
all right if I ask you where you're

750
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,600
going to put your s-bomb I get a lot of

751
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,980
answers like oh I'll just stick it in

752
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,720
the source code repository or I'll dump

753
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,460
it in the container or whatever

754
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,260
that's fine that's that's not a problem

755
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,600
other than to Dan's Point earlier right

756
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,220
you really need a system to be able to

757
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,200
visualize those if you're not looking at

758
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,840
the data an s-bomb does nothing right if

759
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,220
you're not comparing it to vulnerability

760
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,620
data or whatnot but what about as soon

761
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,940
as one of your suppliers gives you an

762
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,400
s-bomb where are you going to put that

763
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,960
and you're just gonna have like a random

764
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,480
get repo that has a bunch of s-bombs in

765
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,580
it right you we need a solution of where

766
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,720
to put those

767
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,279
and then again good luck getting an

768
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,200
s-bomb from A supplier I've been trying

769
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,179
for a year

770
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:40,500
um and we'll hopefully be getting more

771
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,260
in the near future but nobody's doing

772
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,679
this today

773
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,659
all right are we on time

774
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,179
all right we'll speed up a little bit so

775
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,740
um this is a software composition

776
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,000
analysis

777
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,880
problem here right but you know in my

778
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,380
experience again when I came into this

779
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,120
position I was coming at it more from

780
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,279
I've been Consulting in appsec for for

781
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,500
many years and you know I was kind of

782
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,440
under this impression that we've solved

783
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,980
this open source analysis problem and I

784
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,380
was really surprised by how much it

785
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,940
sucks

786
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,940
um it's not an easy thing to do

787
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,559
um and you know it's figuring out how to

788
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,659
integrate the tools how to scan how to

789
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,940
get consistent results right

790
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,820
um I started this position

791
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,419
um November 22nd of last year right

792
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,360
before Thanksgiving right within two

793
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,260
weeks

794
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,779
was log 4J

795
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,480
um so uh you know I had to take actually

796
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,000
what happened was the log 4J came in it

797
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,679
was like two in the morning or something

798
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,140
in the U.S right so what happened is you

799
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,360
have a team over in Asia took a look at

800
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,299
it they went into our our software

801
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,399
composition analysis tool and he said oh

802
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,279
we don't see any log 4J we're good we're

803
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,120
done

804
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,740
right and then I came in in the morning

805
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,500
and I'm like holy we have log4j

806
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,120
everywhere

807
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,140
um why did you all say we don't right so

808
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,419
um you got to use the tools to get value

809
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,220
out of them right and then it's the same

810
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,020
problem where do you scan how do you

811
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,179
scan how do you get the results you know

812
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,919
do you do it in the pipeline do you

813
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,740
manually scan do you do the containers

814
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,720
um personally the most value I've

815
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,340
received has been just doing it directly

816
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,159
in GitHub so I've got my tooling now it

817
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,279
took me nine months to get it there and

818
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,620
I'm actually still having problems

819
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,120
um but basically it's integrated into

820
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,179
GitHub and now it scans on every single

821
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,240
commit and you know we get about 95

822
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,120
cover just that way a lot of people

823
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,460
argue for pipeline scans

824
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,080
um honestly I have found that having it

825
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,820
integrated into GitHub

826
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,500
I really don't need to do the pipeline

827
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,140
scan because most of the pipeline scans

828
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,480
just go out to your repo they do a clone

829
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,399
and then they scan it and do all their

830
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,140
analysis well I'm already doing that in

831
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,700
GitHub why do I need to do it a second

832
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,980
time right like let's just call the API

833
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,140
and see the results and not waste time

834
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,419
with 15 more minutes of scanning because

835
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,320
pipelines are cool

836
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,580
um I've got to layer this with with

837
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,279
other tools right so when log4j first

838
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,220
hit it took me about

839
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,520
four to five days to identify everywhere

840
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,740
in our internal code where we had log4j

841
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,200
right I'm going to crypto startup I

842
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,320
don't have Decades of source code and

843
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,080
thousands of products right we really

844
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,059
have one product

845
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,480
um and about 1500 or so code

846
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,399
repositories that are that are split up

847
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,100
so it's I'm kind of playing the game on

848
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,539
easy mode

849
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,100
um and even then it still took me four

850
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,779
to five days to figure out where we had

851
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,480
log4j and that's not even

852
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,299
talking to my suppliers and figuring out

853
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,039
where they have logged4j which was

854
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,320
another problem

855
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,659
last week for Apache comments I did all

856
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,120
of that in an hour I was able to find

857
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,919
everywhere in our organization where we

858
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,200
had Apache Commons text if we were

859
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,880
affected and if we were calling the code

860
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,919
right and I was able to do that really

861
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,840
with a combination of our open source

862
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,700
tooling which is now integrated into

863
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,620
GitHub and getting scans on every commit

864
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,240
right but I still don't trust that I've

865
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,640
been in appsec a while our data sucks

866
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,100
and our reports suck right so if it

867
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,720
tells me I have it in these five places

868
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't trust that right I do more

869
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,659
analysis GitHub code search is great

870
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:28,700
right

871
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,159
cs.github.com if you haven't signed up

872
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,960
for it it's it's a kind of an

873
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,760
experimental feature that you have to

874
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,740
click a button and say please give it to

875
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,640
me

876
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,700
um go do it it's awesome

877
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,500
um it basically takes the code searching

878
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,140
that you can do on GitHub and makes it

879
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,480
great and easy and you can do a lot of

880
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,340
just complicated searches and get

881
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,039
instant results and then s-bombs right

882
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,539
so yeah I have at this point I have

883
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,700
s-bombs from all of my containers you

884
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,740
know so I was able to go in look at my S

885
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,899
bumps look at my open source analysis

886
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,299
results and then look at GitHub code

887
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,000
search and now all three of those tools

888
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,460
gave me the same results

889
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,220
now I trust that data right those are

890
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,320
probably the only places where we have

891
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,220
log4j or whatever it may be

892
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,720
um I've had a lot of challenges with

893
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,720
tech Stacks right it's another age-old

894
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,580
appsec problem right tools do pretty

895
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,980
good with old school Java and net or

896
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,779
whatever but you throw anything more

897
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,760
modern into the mix and most the tools

898
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,679
start falling on their faces

899
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,500
um and what I have found is Gradle is a

900
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,779
huge problem with this tooling if my

901
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,120
developers do anything even slightly

902
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,179
non-standard with Gradle my open source

903
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,940
scans will start to fail and the problem

904
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,919
is if you're not paying attention you

905
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,100
just lose visibility and results so

906
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,659
um you know I have one package in

907
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,700
particular that's a problem child that's

908
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
something like 1700 open source

909
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,500
libraries in it including the

910
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,679
transitives when the scan fails the tool

911
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,779
doesn't tell you the scan failed right

912
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,659
it says the scan was successful

913
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,000
um but that it only found two libraries

914
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,399
so if you're not paying attention it

915
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,020
looks like you fixed a bunch of things

916
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,300
or whatever it gets lost in the noise

917
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,460
right so you got to really pay attention

918
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,560
to those things and vulnerability

919
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,179
Management's lacking or non-existent

920
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,159
right so especially for those of you who

921
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,320
might use SAS to these other tools and

922
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,239
you're used to having some sort of a

923
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,099
triage workflow that makes you drink at

924
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,560
night or whatever it's even worse when

925
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,060
you get into open source because the

926
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,280
issue either exists or it doesn't

927
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,199
um you know there's no way to say hide

928
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,418
this issue and a lot of these tools or

929
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,820
it's not exploitable or I'm looking at

930
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,580
it and um you know Market is in progress

931
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,379
or something like that right it's it's

932
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:50,359
there or it's not that's it

933
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,679
all right three a few security leading

934
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,480
practices exist for securing the

935
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,460
software Factory

936
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,900
um again I thought this would be pretty

937
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,920
easy

938
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,280
um it's not right you know it's I've

939
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
asked my vendors um how to harden their

940
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,060
systems to provide me with guidelines

941
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,640
things like that you know there are no

942
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,040
leading practices that I have found that

943
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,420
tell you how to take your software

944
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,040
Factory and how to lock it down so

945
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,440
either pay a consultant you know to come

946
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,180
in and tell you all the many ways that

947
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,920
they can hack your your factory and

948
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,020
believe me there's a lot of them

949
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,359
um you know or or figured out yourself

950
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,839
um but there's it's it's a lot of work

951
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,300
personal access tokens are your worst

952
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,320
enemy

953
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,280
um how many people in here are

954
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,200
Developers

955
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,119
quite a few so you probably all have a

956
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,040
personal access token

957
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,000
um you know for your source code

958
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,740
management or whatever right so if

959
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,020
you're not familiar basically probably

960
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,940
about any tool in your software Factory

961
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,740
you need to be able to communicate with

962
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,320
it right you need to make a get push to

963
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,660
push your source code up or you need to

964
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,300
create a pull request or you need to

965
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,400
pull a container from your artifact

966
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,560
repository or something of that nature

967
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,140
right nobody uses the GUI right nobody

968
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,839
goes to you know your your GitHub

969
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,079
instance and clicks buttons right you

970
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,700
open up the command line and you

971
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,380
configure your authentication in the

972
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,480
command line you know to talk to the

973
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,220
service and then right you integrate

974
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,320
with your Ides or whatever all of these

975
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,180
tools do that with a personal access

976
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,579
token right so like GitHub for example

977
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,980
you go into the developer tools you log

978
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,020
in and then you say generate a personal

979
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,660
access token and I want it to have these

980
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,579
permissions and we're lazy so we all

981
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,140
give it the same permissions that we

982
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,960
have and hopefully we're not an admin

983
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,040
and then it it says we're only going to

984
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,540
show you this token once so store it

985
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,280
somewhere and you put it inside of your

986
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,140
your secret vault hopefully and not on a

987
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,560
notepad and then you just go about your

988
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
day right and that's how we generally

989
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,099
configure service accounts and things

990
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,859
like that too well guess what if

991
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,359
somebody gets a hold of one of these

992
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,380
accounts

993
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,780
they're authenticated into these

994
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,400
services so whether it's your your

995
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,500
source code management or your artifact

996
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,680
repository or your CI system whatever it

997
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,359
may be right and hopefully many of you

998
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,880
have observed this too if you're

999
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,680
communicating to these systems through

1000
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,040
the API or a CLI you're not logging in

1001
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,859
with usernames and passwords and MFA or

1002
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,320
SSO all that right you're giving it

1003
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,079
effectively an API token that's your

1004
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,540
authentication so if one of these gets

1005
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,000
leaked out

1006
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,760
that's very very very very bad

1007
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,740
authentication services are helpful

1008
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,140
right so you know if we think of things

1009
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,260
like OCTA or whatever everybody's using

1010
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,440
OCTA today right so we can put OCTA in

1011
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,180
front of these different services and

1012
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,980
they'll secure the UE so we can say okay

1013
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,079
well I've got github.com and so I'm just

1014
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,640
going to put OCTA in front of it then

1015
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,520
I've got SSO and MFA and you know and

1016
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,740
I'm super secure and that's all well and

1017
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,599
good right well if you're operating

1018
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,220
these services in the cloud and they're

1019
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,980
not on-prem well that only secures the

1020
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,920
GUI right so again you can just hit the

1021
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,339
API with that Pat it's not going through

1022
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,280
your Cloud router or any of this other

1023
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,140
stuff right you're going out to the open

1024
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,440
internet on that API and talking to that

1025
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,380
service so authentication services are

1026
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,820
great but you need to know that they

1027
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,859
have blind spots

1028
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,980
as my next Point API is accessible via

1029
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,900
the Internet by by default

1030
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,599
obviously if you're running on-prem

1031
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,460
um you don't have these same problems

1032
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,320
hopefully

1033
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,940
and then we've also got inconsistent

1034
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,800
security standards across vendors right

1035
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,780
so there's no consistent ways that

1036
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,640
authentication is being implemented and

1037
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,000
the API tokens are being managed you

1038
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,560
know how you create users how you

1039
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,300
maintain them right A lot of these even

1040
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,980
if you're putting saml or whatever in

1041
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,720
front of them you can still create users

1042
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,240
directly in the system you lose that

1043
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,800
visibility and there's a whole host of

1044
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,220
other problems so software Factory also

1045
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,640
not easy

1046
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,079
metric strap adoption however no

1047
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,760
industry guidance so this is another

1048
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,260
problem that's kind of common you know

1049
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,460
with appsec

1050
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,660
um I think I've talked here a couple of

1051
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,300
times about how hard metrics are and how

1052
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,339
most the metrics we generate today just

1053
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,140
aren't valuable right you know if I went

1054
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,180
to my CSO and so we have 2 000 critical

1055
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,099
vulnerabilities I'm just gonna say so

1056
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,440
what what's that mean right what are you

1057
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,240
trying to communicate to me

1058
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,859
um well it's a thousand more than we had

1059
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,960
last time okay did you get better at

1060
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,020
finding them did you create a thousand

1061
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,300
more or you know there's no story

1062
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,520
there's no narrative right so the

1063
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,940
numbers really don't mean anything

1064
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,400
valuable I found no tooling to help with

1065
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,660
this

1066
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,160
um and there's just there's no story to

1067
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,420
tell right so you know we have to figure

1068
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,640
out what our story is how we get those

1069
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,040
metrics and then how we communicate that

1070
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,020
story through those metrics and we'll

1071
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,180
talk about that more in a second

1072
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,339
it's my last observation

1073
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:54,900
this one might be a little more

1074
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,119
controversial supply chain security is

1075
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,500
not appsec

1076
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,800
right it's uh similar

1077
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,980
thank you and again I think today this

1078
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,420
is how we're implementing it right we're

1079
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,040
implementing it as part of an appsec

1080
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,960
program but it's a different skill set

1081
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,300
it's different resources and it's way

1082
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,060
more time intensive than just your your

1083
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,740
appsec program right your appsec

1084
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,320
resources cannot stretch so far to be

1085
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,780
able to do this as well so in our

1086
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,099
organization

1087
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:23,760
um

1088
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,640
I I kind of think of it it's just two

1089
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,280
sides of the same coin right so my

1090
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,099
appsec team is one side of the coin and

1091
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,960
then the supply chain security team is

1092
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,119
really the other side and then we work

1093
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,099
closely together

1094
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,500
um on similar problems

1095
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,240
but really supply chain at the end of

1096
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,859
the day right you all saw the first

1097
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,380
slide it's a lot more broad than appsec

1098
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,480
and it's definitely a whole lot less

1099
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,520
Tactical

1100
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,260
um so the skill sets are similar but

1101
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,480
appsec is definitely more specialized

1102
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,820
and actually had an interesting comment

1103
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,920
from my devops team earlier this week

1104
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,140
where they told me hey you know like if

1105
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,839
I um and how they got a typo there so it

1106
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,240
should be SCS plus devops is equal to

1107
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,460
devsecops I found that really

1108
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,200
interesting because I've spent about the

1109
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,480
last seven years talking about how

1110
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,660
defsecops is really appsec at speed and

1111
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,160
at scale

1112
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,900
um and so when the devops team said that

1113
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,240
to me it's like well okay that's one

1114
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,980
definition and it's not entirely wrong

1115
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,540
so I thought that was pretty interesting

1116
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,599
all right Lessons Learned so let's

1117
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,180
hopefully make this a bit more positive

1118
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,780
um

1119
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,000
so follow the path of least resistance

1120
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,820
and that's not always shifting left so

1121
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,320
let's go back to last year and talk

1122
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,420
about how much I hate shift left right

1123
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,040
but um I think as appsec professionals

1124
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,540
um you know we talk all of the time

1125
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,000
about shift left right we we can't

1126
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,640
escape it and you know especially with

1127
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,500
the open source analysis right you know

1128
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,240
I think I kind of had all of these ideas

1129
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,700
that we talk about all of the time like

1130
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,040
let's put dependabot in there and let's

1131
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,260
automatically create PRS and the

1132
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,760
developers can just look at them and say

1133
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,180
cool I approve this and like we're done

1134
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,160
um let's put the issues inside of GitHub

1135
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,800
so that they're right there right and

1136
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,180
you know it's all these shift left

1137
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,380
things

1138
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,820
um and actually our head of engineering

1139
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,700
actually pulled me aside and said look

1140
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,820
I get it this is great I understand what

1141
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,980
you're trying to do and I appreciate it

1142
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,280
but this sucks and this is not how we

1143
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,560
operate right and in our case you know

1144
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,099
it's hey we live and die inside of our

1145
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,440
you know our issue trackers and you know

1146
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,060
um you know our jurists and things like

1147
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,040
that so you know if you really want to

1148
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,720
get traction and you want to get these

1149
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,420
things resolved you know for us going it

1150
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,280
might seem like we're living in GitHub

1151
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,260
and we can just click that button but

1152
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,780
that's actually more work for us so how

1153
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,820
about you send us tickets and then we'll

1154
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,280
prioritize accordingly and get that

1155
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,960
built into the Sprints and then the

1156
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,359
developers can you know remediate right

1157
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:01,920
and it's all part of their normal

1158
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,660
development workflow that they're

1159
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,180
following today right so you know and

1160
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,099
it's

1161
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:09,180
counter-intuitive I think you know to a

1162
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,640
lot of things that that we hear but you

1163
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,260
know the point is the developers already

1164
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,420
had a process they have a way of working

1165
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,060
and what we think is easy

1166
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,819
isn't always easy for them right so you

1167
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,619
know build Partnerships work with your

1168
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:26,040
Dev teams understand how they work and

1169
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,200
then fit into those workflows right as

1170
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,300
opposed to shifting left for the sake of

1171
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,000
Shifting left right and that's you know

1172
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,319
the next message here right build

1173
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,359
Partnerships not enemies right when we

1174
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,040
come out and say oh this conference told

1175
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,200
me to shift left a thousand times

1176
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,000
um you know we need to shift left right

1177
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
you're probably going to upset some

1178
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,420
people along the way and you're going to

1179
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,579
make their lives harder and then finally

1180
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,940
strive for Progress over Perfection and

1181
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,260
I've seen this in many many

1182
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,079
organizations right we try to solve all

1183
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,060
the problem at once you know we try to

1184
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,619
come up with the perfect solution we

1185
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,180
roll it out it's

1186
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,220
this is just not how it is right you

1187
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,780
know it's it's crawl walk run right

1188
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,520
let's start somewhere and then let's

1189
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,040
make incremental improvements until the

1190
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,720
end of time right because we we all know

1191
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,640
we're never going to be done but let's

1192
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,460
not let that perfect end State you know

1193
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,260
prevent us from making progress today

1194
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,020
right get out there and start

1195
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,160
um you know so that way we can

1196
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,980
continuously improve

1197
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,420
so to find what supply chain security

1198
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,760
means in your organization right not all

1199
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,839
of you are going to agree with my

1200
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,220
definition right if it's our

1201
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,500
organization great it might not fit

1202
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,839
yours right and so you know one of the

1203
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,119
challenges that I had was we had a lot

1204
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,400
of you know what I call gray area

1205
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,160
um in there right is it tprm or is it

1206
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,020
supply chain right if we need to look at

1207
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,839
this vendor and ask for a sock 2 or

1208
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,180
something like that who does that right

1209
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,300
is it tprm is it GRC is it supply chain

1210
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,400
I don't know well when lock 4J came out

1211
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,400
right it's really a code issue at the

1212
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,040
end of the day so is that appsec or is

1213
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,319
it supply chain security

1214
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,000
um you know there's just a lot of areas

1215
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,859
where if you're not careful you know

1216
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,720
this can overlap with what your other

1217
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,940
teams are doing and then you end up with

1218
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,619
multiple teams trying to solve the same

1219
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,000
problem or you're stepping on each

1220
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,160
other's foot or you eventually just say

1221
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,619
nah you go do it I'm busy enough right

1222
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:17,880
so

1223
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,380
um you know your first time you draft

1224
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,420
this you're probably going to have a lot

1225
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,240
of gray area that's okay understand it

1226
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,460
talk about it and when you run across

1227
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,619
those things redefine your program a

1228
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,000
little bit right so that way you're

1229
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,480
removing that gray area as you go

1230
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,800
you're not gonna get it right the first

1231
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,500
time right this is New Right does

1232
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,000
anybody else in here have a supply chain

1233
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,920
security team

1234
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,619
I hope so but I doubt it um in a year I

1235
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,480
haven't found another organization that

1236
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,579
that does and and I'm actively looking

1237
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,280
for one right because it's uh it's hard

1238
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,000
to figure all of this out so you're I

1239
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,099
didn't get it right the first time

1240
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:57,780
um I'm about the 12th time now and I

1241
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,859
still don't have it completely right

1242
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,960
you're not going to either right this is

1243
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,300
all new so you know just understand that

1244
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,099
you know your first time is not going to

1245
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,300
be perfect

1246
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,819
uh evaluate you know your third parties

1247
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,920
and how you engage with them today grow

1248
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,540
from there right just pick somewhere to

1249
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,520
start is it security assessments is it

1250
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,160
looking at at open source is it

1251
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,420
um you know pissing off half your

1252
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,920
company by telling them they can't use

1253
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,900
browser extensions anymore and then

1254
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,760
doing an approval process for each one

1255
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,740
of them right just pick something and

1256
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,839
then grow from there right so you know

1257
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,940
day one of my Rel first thing I did was

1258
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,099
I went in and I created a Wiki

1259
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,260
um and I basically said this is you know

1260
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,720
what I think supply chain security is

1261
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,819
then that became the foundation and then

1262
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,980
again it's a Wiki right if I change my

1263
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,440
mind I edit it and then I communicate

1264
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,480
that out and everybody's fine with that

1265
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,240
so measure things then improve them

1266
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,400
right so if you're doing something today

1267
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,380
measure it if you want to do something

1268
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,700
tomorrow

1269
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,099
measure it right start collecting that

1270
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,740
data develop the trends show what they

1271
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,800
are and then work to improve them right

1272
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,660
you know do you have too many admins in

1273
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,900
one of your systems do you know do you

1274
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,300
have repos that don't have don't allow

1275
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,740
pull requests and people can just

1276
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,359
directly commit I don't I don't know

1277
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,740
right you know what's your total number

1278
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,480
of Open Source vulnerabilities there's a

1279
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,040
lot of things that you can pick right

1280
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,260
even if you're not necessarily tackling

1281
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,579
it today

1282
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,920
start measuring it so that way when you

1283
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,260
do start initiatives to tackle those

1284
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,480
problems you can show and demonstrate

1285
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,400
the projects or the progress that you're

1286
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,160
making with those Trends right so so

1287
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,140
you're not gonna really what I'm saying

1288
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,140
is don't go solve problems and then

1289
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,760
develop metrics

1290
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,859
and then report them right do the

1291
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,260
metrics today then go start solving the

1292
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,480
challenges and then you know show the

1293
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,460
metrics right so maybe you see three

1294
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,560
months of hey you suck at everything

1295
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,720
right but it's cool we're collecting the

1296
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,460
data right so then we start tackling the

1297
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,560
problem hopefully if we're tackling it

1298
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,020
right right we see the values come down

1299
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,180
or whatever direction we want it to go

1300
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,220
based on the story we're trying to tell

1301
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,200
and then think about the story that you

1302
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,520
want to tell right because it's probably

1303
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,200
not I have so many open source

1304
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,760
vulnerabilities or something like that

1305
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,040
right it's you know here's a really

1306
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,740
interesting attack chain of how you know

1307
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,480
somebody could compromise our software

1308
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,980
Factory and then here's the different

1309
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,839
areas that we can build in security

1310
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,760
controls and then here's how we're going

1311
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,160
to measure each one of them so then that

1312
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,680
way when this lands on um you know in my

1313
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,380
case all the way to the CEO's desk

1314
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,540
um it's telling a story and you know

1315
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,220
they can look at the numbers and they

1316
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,980
can extrapolate to that story as opposed

1317
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,940
to

1318
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,980
numbers right you know they don't care

1319
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,579
about CVSs scores or red Amber green or

1320
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:46,500
whatever right what's what's the story

1321
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,040
you're telling

1322
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,000
if you start now you'll be well ahead of

1323
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,160
most other companies right again

1324
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,900
I haven't found anybody else doing a

1325
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,700
supply chain security program yet right

1326
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,740
so if you go back and start one on

1327
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,599
Monday you're well ahead of the curve

1328
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:01,980
right so this is getting back to

1329
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,140
Industry analysts the first call that I

1330
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,119
had with an industry analyst they don't

1331
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,560
live in a forest they work in a garden

1332
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,599
you can kind of read between the lines

1333
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,940
there they literally told me you can

1334
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,339
spell s-bomb that I have nothing to tell

1335
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:15,540
you here

1336
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,000
um you're well ahead of everyone else

1337
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,420
right that that was literally a quote

1338
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,700
from an industry analyst talking about

1339
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,599
s-bombs so there's not any best guidance

1340
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,319
out there right so you know start now

1341
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,780
you'll be well ahead of everyone else

1342
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,520
we all know supply chain security is

1343
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,500
going to be critical right it's again

1344
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,540
six talks here you know one of the most

1345
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,000
popular topics that RSA and we know the

1346
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,560
executive order is coming

1347
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,599
let's be proactive let's start doing

1348
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,460
this let's figure out how to tackle this

1349
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,500
and be ahead of the curve and there's

1350
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,560
really no barrier of Entry right it's

1351
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,440
fair game right it's all Greenfield so

1352
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,420
you know if you have an idea you know

1353
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,520
Step Up start tackling these problems

1354
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,960
right you know talk to your third

1355
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,720
parties do a security assessment

1356
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,279
um whatever it might be

1357
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,160
so all we talk about test bumps

1358
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,079
I think I've established now we can't

1359
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:14,760
even really do s-bombs

1360
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,859
but there is a lot that you can do so

1361
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:18,960
this is just some ideas on you know

1362
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,119
where you can start today right so you

1363
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,680
know if you want to take some ideas back

1364
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,359
and try to start rolling out a program

1365
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,640
you know these are just a couple of

1366
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,380
things that you can do right try to

1367
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,240
generate an s-bomb and then ask yourself

1368
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,839
is this everything right if somebody was

1369
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,579
to ask for

1370
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:37,140
um you know a full s-bomb of whatever

1371
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,420
your product might be does that s-bomb

1372
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,700
you created capture everything

1373
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,800
maybe it does maybe it doesn't right if

1374
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,500
it doesn't make it better right pick a

1375
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,720
product make a racy Ask A supplier for

1376
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,280
their s-bomb and then figure out where

1377
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,240
the hell you're going to put it because

1378
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,319
you're going to have some place to put

1379
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,660
it when they do actually give it to you

1380
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,460
um talk to your suppliers right so again

1381
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,619
when log4j came out

1382
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:01,020
um I went out and we you know we were a

1383
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,339
startup right so you know we didn't

1384
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:05,040
necessarily have at that point in time

1385
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,960
um you know a full list of like here's

1386
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,819
every supplier that we've partnered with

1387
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,740
you know as we're in startup mode right

1388
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,480
so we kind of had to figure that out and

1389
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,980
then you know we went out to all of

1390
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,480
those suppliers and said hey there's

1391
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,579
this log 4J thing hopefully all of you

1392
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,700
have heard about it some some had some

1393
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,720
hadn't

1394
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,700
um are you affected by it right okay

1395
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,680
cool when are you gonna patch what's the

1396
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,839
impact where did you find it right and

1397
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,880
most of them were very trans a lot of

1398
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,380
them it took them some time to get that

1399
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,359
to us right but they were open to the

1400
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,760
conversation and they had it with us

1401
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,260
measure how long it takes you to

1402
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,180
identify your open source packages right

1403
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,660
so again log4j took me four to five days

1404
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,300
Apache Commons took me an hour right

1405
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,520
getting back to metrics that's a

1406
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,500
powerful narrative right you know that's

1407
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,480
demonstrating progress that we've made

1408
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,460
in in a year

1409
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,780
um understand your build and deploy

1410
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,160
process right you know do you understand

1411
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,319
how your software Factory works and how

1412
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,059
people are using it

1413
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,500
um I thought I did

1414
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,599
um but I surely didn't

1415
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,640
and then prevent egress internet access

1416
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,280
from your software Factory this one's

1417
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,160
this one's hard right so you know your

1418
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,079
developers are they pulling open source

1419
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,180
packages from the Internet or do they go

1420
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,420
out to your artifact repo and get them a

1421
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,800
lot of cases it probably comes

1422
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,900
internally right you know uh what about

1423
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,640
images are they going out to the

1424
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,500
internet and getting the you know a

1425
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,440
latest image for a container or do you

1426
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,240
have Goten images that they have to use

1427
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,280
can you enforce that

1428
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,500
um you know do the docker files

1429
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,599
um you know go out or GitHub runners or

1430
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:38,160
whatever right do they source code from

1431
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,780
the internet right we should probably

1432
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,119
cut all of that off

1433
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:43,740
um and enforce getting all of that from

1434
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,079
one centralized place and that's really

1435
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,819
hard to do

1436
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,440
so real quick because I know I'm out of

1437
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,240
time you know what do I see is the

1438
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,260
future

1439
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,300
tooling right we have no tooling today

1440
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,940
we need tooling somebody has to step up

1441
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,800
they have to fill that space

1442
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,180
best practices

1443
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,640
again we have none right so you know

1444
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,260
somebody needs to step up and develop

1445
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,000
some standards and guidelines that we

1446
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,180
can use which to the next Point CIS has

1447
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,040
actually put out a really really good

1448
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,359
Benchmark

1449
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,359
um that I was really really happy fairly

1450
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,920
aligns with the program that I put

1451
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,059
together

1452
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:19,260
um so you I think it's behind I didn't

1453
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,640
put the link because I think it's behind

1454
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,380
a paywall or something weird because

1455
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,839
it's CIS but they do have a benchmark

1456
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,059
for supply chain security that you can

1457
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:28,920
use today to go out and kind of manage

1458
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,480
and help you build a program

1459
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,400
we need hardening guidelines right we

1460
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,440
need supplier adoption we can talk about

1461
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,300
s-bombs and things all day long but

1462
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,040
until our vendors and suppliers start

1463
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,319
giving them to us it's it's kind of uh

1464
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,660
meaningless so you know we need them to

1465
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,520
support this just as well as we need to

1466
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,740
support it we need s-bombs everywhere

1467
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,079
and and from everything right and we

1468
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,700
need tooling to generate them and we

1469
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,200
need to make sure that they're generated

1470
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,780
according to the specifications

1471
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,359
I've thought a lot about can I use

1472
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,099
s-bombs to replace my software

1473
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:01,740
composition analysis so if I've got an

1474
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,800
accurate s-bomb for all of my packages

1475
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,319
right you know do I really need software

1476
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:09,240
composition analysis sitting out there

1477
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,460
scanning my package managers and then

1478
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,500
giving me a list of vulnerabilities well

1479
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,599
if it's faster and easier for me to

1480
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,300
generate an s-bomb and then map those

1481
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,819
packages to vulnerabilities well why the

1482
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:22,800
hell wouldn't I just do that right and

1483
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,599
if I was some of these composition

1484
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:26,280
analysis vendors I would be scared of

1485
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,480
this

1486
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,480
um because you know once those vendors

1487
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,099
that the s-bomb vendors the couple there

1488
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:34,500
are actually put out a tool to generate

1489
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,119
the s-bomb for you instead of you

1490
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:37,980
figuring out that part

1491
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,079
well it's we don't really have as much

1492
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,000
need for software composition analysis

1493
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,680
other than we could argue maybe in a

1494
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,819
pipeline

1495
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,020
um and then obviously we have the

1496
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,000
executive order right so hopefully that

1497
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,579
will drive adoption but we're seeing uh

1498
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:53,460
very little of that today

1499
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,280
so in conclusion s-bombs are the

1500
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,140
conversation starter but they're not

1501
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,119
they're not the end game right to Dan's

1502
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,000
point they're really the bare minimum

1503
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,619
and they're really really really

1504
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:07,020
challenging

1505
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,700
um you know building this in your appsec

1506
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,440
program might be a good place to start

1507
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,359
but you know once you really start

1508
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:14,280
looking at all of your supply chain it

1509
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,319
gets much bigger and broader than appsec

1510
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,420
really quick

1511
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,640
so that's it I don't think we have time

1512
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,500
for for questions but you know if you

1513
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,180
have any feel free to come come grab me

1514
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,690
thank you very much

1515
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:31,590
[Applause]
