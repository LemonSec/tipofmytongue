[Music]

6
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,920
thank you

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,440
hello everybody don't mind me while I

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
open up this gift

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,199
excuse me I'm not gonna do that right

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,219
now

11
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:02,879
um

12
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,760
so I am here to talk about uh app SEC

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,380
looking sick

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,560
um uh some of my BIOS recently have said

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,260
that I am the CTO of bit Discovery I am

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,540
not uh that has been sold I am now the

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,540
deputy CTO of tenable uh so don't repeat

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,920
that whole dirty rumor about the

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,799
discovery because it is now gone

20
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,140
um but more importantly I'm here to talk

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,360
about appsec in general

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,159
um so I've noticed something weird

23
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,900
there's something weird that's been

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,580
going on it's been happening for a while

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,680
and it's it's been brewing inside of me

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,420
like I just can't figure it out because

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,579
it doesn't feel like it's one problem it

28
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,560
feels like there's many sub things that

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,500
are going on with it and uh I kind of

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,900
wanted to start digging in and figuring

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,880
it out like what what is really

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,619
happening here and it feels like a mix

33
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,960
of incentives and Technical problems and

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,040
a bunch of different things that are

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,079
happening at the same time so

36
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,780
so let's start with the elephant in the

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,579
room and I'm sure some people will like

38
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,320
hey that doesn't apply to me we're

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,820
definitely doing a risk-based approach

40
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,680
to infosec you are definitely not doing

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,399
an information based risk assessment uh

42
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,619
program at all you aren't and I'll prove

43
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,500
it to you uh so don't worry uh you might

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
be doing some Fair methodology and like

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,379
a microcosm or something or as an

46
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,000
experiment or lab but you're definitely

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,700
not doing it at scale uh no one is it's

48
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,180
not your fault uh and I'll explain why

49
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,220
so let's start with a fundamental

50
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,440
problem that's driving a lot of these

51
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,480
issues so some people keep saying we're

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,220
like like we need more head counts and

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,980
security we need more people in security

54
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,840
and and the face that actually sounds

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,180
like very good advice uh and I would

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,099
call this the hiring your way out of the

57
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,260
problem like if we could just throw more

58
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,060
bodies at this thing I think we could

59
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,640
finally get ahead of security uh the

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,500
problem is what I have been I've been

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,480
asking a lot of high-end security people

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800
if they've been noticing the same thing

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,959
I've actually been seeing a degradation

64
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,540
as opposed to an improvement in overall

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,300
security expertise per capita of the

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,680
people that I talked to Within These

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,580
Mega Corps uh in general so if you go

68
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,780
talk to let's say the average

69
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,060
practitioner you know somebody who uh

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,519
manages firewalls or switches or does an

71
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,519
app set program or whatever they tend to

72
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,700
know less than we knew 10 years ago uh

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,680
not more than uh more than 20 years ago

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
which is good so at least there's some

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,580
improvement overall but less than 10

76
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,900
years ago so we we are seeing a

77
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,459
degradation and I'm like why is that

78
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,019
happening I just don't understand like I

79
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,220
go in these meetings and I'm saying

80
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,780
things that we have not we have known to

81
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,060
not been true for like at least 20 years

82
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,760
like you can't run two websites on one

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,739
IP address like what what are you

84
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,260
talking about of course you can do that

85
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,519
um and so there's something happening

86
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,799
and I'm just like what is causing this

87
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,200
weird delay or decrease in in

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,060
capabilities

89
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,739
um and what I think is happening is

90
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,019
there's a brain drain so people at the

91
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,940
very very top end of the industry are

92
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,260
starting to age out they're starting to

93
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,659
do other things uh so they're no longer

94
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,920
hands on keyboard they're no longer

95
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,080
actually doing appsec or you know

96
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,280
network security or whatever they're

97
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,560
supposed to be doing uh because that's

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,819
their calling that's what they're really

99
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,080
really good at and passionate about

100
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,220
that's what they got started in this

101
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,319
industry they started the industry uh

102
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,340
what they're doing now is they're

103
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,260
becoming Executives or they're aging out

104
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,480
entirely and just retiring or they're

105
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,298
becoming VCS uh I had a conversation

106
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,459
with somebody who's only one year shy of

107
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,460
me in this industry so 27 and me in 28

108
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,380
years in Memphis a sec and he said he's

109
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,880
going to start a VR company and he's

110
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,100
leaving and this is happening all over

111
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,520
the place and so I think that that very

112
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,740
top cream of the cream uh cream the crop

113
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,120
they're just leaving they're moving

114
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,139
somewhere else

115
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,820
and so that leaves the second layer down

116
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
which is the people who came up just

117
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,139
beneath them and what's happening to

118
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,580
them is they're turning into managers

119
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,740
they're turning into csos they're

120
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,720
turning into VPS of engineering or

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,759
whatever uh and they're not like

122
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,040
backfilling those people with like

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
really solid people they're they're

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,759
backfilling them with people who they

125
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,979
have to put in that seat where are they

126
00:04:58,979 --> 00:04:59,940
getting them well they're getting them

127
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,340
from colleges for the most part uh and

128
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,400
when I talk to uh high-end csos who

129
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,240
actually know what they're doing who

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,440
actually measured these kinds of things

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
I ask them like are you getting good

132
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,280
people out of these colleges uh and the

133
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,259
answer is no because I'm not doing that

134
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,360
because they're terrible uh I'm not

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,040
getting them out of colleges uh because

136
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,419
if I get them out of colleges I have to

137
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,160
do entirely retrain them because they

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,780
don't know what they're doing it's

139
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,940
effectively like getting a brand new off

140
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,100
the street person uh in fact some in

141
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,419
some ways worse because they have a lot

142
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,460
of bad assumptions I'd rather poach them

143
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,139
from somebody else just go get them from

144
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,820
somewhere else which means you're seeing

145
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,800
a consolidation of talent and a couple

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,539
of companies that can afford it and all

147
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,979
of the rest of them are there you're

148
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,380
seeing a degradation uh and so what

149
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,360
happens I I got a little bit of flack I

150
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,820
talked about this uh last week

151
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,560
and some in the audience said it's like

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,419
well you know the problem it's not like

153
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,340
we need every single person to be an

154
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,560
expert uh it's not like we have like

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
experts a doctor that's an expert in

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,000
everything it's like no no no this is

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,340
much more analogous to handing somebody

158
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,259
a knife and pushing them into an

159
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,000
emergency room and say just go for it

160
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,160
because if you believe that security

161
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,380
matters at all and I tend to think it

162
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,300
does matter quite a bit you probably

163
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,759
don't want to have the most critical

164
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,380
parts of your infrastructure managed by

165
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,120
people who literally have never done

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,580
that job before and aren't well trained

167
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,199
by the people above them because the

168
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,780
people above them aren't well trained uh

169
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,300
or very less trained than they should be

170
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,120
so part of it is also coming from

171
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,699
there's a move when when I got started

172
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,259
it was all about being interested in it

173
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,819
if you're really interested in security

174
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,740
you go into security uh it's kind of a

175
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,240
fun thing you don't get paid for it you

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
just kind of hack on stuff and you find

177
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
cool stuff and you write research papers

178
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,220
and you go up to conferences that's it

179
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,780
there really was no money in application

180
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,419
security surely an application security

181
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,000
a little bit network security uh

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,520
nowadays uh you get paid very well to be

183
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,020
in security so now people are seeing it

184
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,819
more as a profession so you go into it

185
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,039
for the nine to five you go home you

186
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,720
have you know a beautiful house and your

187
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,039
kids and you never think about security

188
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,780
the rest of the time maybe occasionally

189
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,280
there's a P1 issue you have to stay late

190
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,259
or something and that's it that is just

191
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,180
not you don't see these crazy Lan

192
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,620
parties you used to see you don't see

193
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,080
people just hacking all day to make some

194
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,060
little widget turn I mean it does happen

195
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,639
but it's way less as a percentage than

196
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,740
it used to be it used to be that's all

197
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,419
you'd see at hacking conferences that

198
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,940
was just that was what it was like so

199
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,940
now it's a quantity over quality and can

200
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,919
you

201
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,960
has to put bodies in the seats and now

202
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,360
I'll talk about bad seesaw incentives

203
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,900
so these are the real incentives of a

204
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,599
CSO now obviously I'm not talking about

205
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,160
you if you're a CSO in the audience

206
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,020
obviously

207
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,000
um I'm talking about every other ciso in

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
the entire world

209
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,380
um so first of all your first incentive

210
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,599
is do not get fired you don't want to

211
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,639
get fired that's not good for you uh

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,800
makes a lot of sense so how do you get

213
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,599
uh not get fired well you gotta look

214
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,919
good you gotta look good for your board

215
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,660
the executives just don't say anything

216
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,319
too dumb uh show up with pretty graphs

217
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,880
uh those graphs don't actually have to

218
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,759
mean anything or say anything useful uh

219
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,380
truly they don't because no one's really

220
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,479
fact checking security people so you're

221
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,580
just like okay well the CSO is saying

222
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,380
whatever they're saying today so I guess

223
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,479
fine I guess we're good today they seem

224
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,940
confident okay anyway get them out of

225
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,080
here as quickly as possible so we can

226
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,520
get the actual business

227
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,979
um and even if this is detrimental and

228
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,440
even truly bad for security it truly

229
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,639
doesn't matter you just don't want to

230
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
get fired right that's number one number

231
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,599
two don't increase your personal

232
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,700
liability as a CSO you don't want to be

233
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,958
in a position where you're going to end

234
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,120
up in court uh you don't want to be in a

235
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,860
position where you're more likely to

236
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,899
take Flack for whatever happens which

237
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,659
means you need to leave in 18 months uh

238
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,219
you're supposed to get in there you want

239
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,420
to do a couple projects and then you

240
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,800
want to leave

241
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,500
um but it also means that you don't want

242
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,740
to have uh any knowledge of any

243
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,959
potential threats for which you have not

244
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,360
tried to solve which means the less you

245
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,880
know the better

246
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,399
next you're supposed to quit before the

247
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,720
bad thing happens so that's the 18

248
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,019
months thing get out of there uh do your

249
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,899
business do the two or three projects

250
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,220
typically the best kinds of projects to

251
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,360
pick are going to be infrastructure

252
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
projects typically firewalls you know

253
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,680
upgrade from top layer to Cisco or

254
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,140
whatever uh upgrade from the old

255
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,300
antivirus to the new antivirus you know

256
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,580
one or two things maybe three if you're

257
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,320
really really feeling like it's Gotta

258
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,180
gotta get it in for the resume but

259
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,920
that's it don't do anything more if you

260
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,760
do anything more you're actually

261
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,220
increasing your personal risk get out of

262
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,260
there get out of there take the next job

263
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,899
okay so obviously I'm not talking about

264
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,220
you if you're a CSO because I know

265
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,899
you're doing a really good job

266
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,260
so I My Little Slice the world's called

267
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,420
easm external attack surface management

268
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,220
which is basically just fine assets that

269
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,500
are on the public internet and so here's

270
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,019
some more terrible things so again I

271
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,000
said if you know about any vulnerability

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,100
then that increases your personal

273
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,540
liability because then you have to go do

274
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,640
something about it and keep in mind your

275
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,140
people are actually not qualified

276
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,880
anymore to do those types of things or

277
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,080
at least not as qualified as they were

278
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,180
even 10 years ago and we all know those

279
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,860
people

280
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,399
um and so it has a CSO you don't want to

281
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,560
know about more liability so what does

282
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,480
easm show you it shows you a whole bunch

283
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,060
more assets for which are you really not

284
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,320
going to run scans on those things

285
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,060
because now when the bad thing happens

286
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,160
the executives can say well why weren't

287
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,920
you scanning that thing well okay so I

288
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,779
don't want to know more about my assets

289
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,459
that makes no sense why would I ever

290
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,620
want to know more about more of my

291
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,839
liabilities uh that doesn't make sense

292
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,940
so my personal liability goes up if I

293
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,380
find out about anything that I shouldn't

294
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,320
find out about so why would I ever spend

295
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,580
money trying to find more

296
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,180
vulnerabilities makes no sense okay

297
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,779
all right next let's say I could get

298
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,640
past that objection let's say that I

299
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,860
could weigh the magic wand and all those

300
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,779
incentives were totally protect like

301
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,060
fixed or whatever and you wanted to scan

302
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,980
everything and I truly mean everything

303
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,279
every port on every single IP address on

304
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,899
every single machine on the public

305
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,940
internet it all wanted to be scanned or

306
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,500
at least inside your organization let's

307
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,899
just turn it on so first of all you

308
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,240
can't uh you first of all you don't know

309
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,320
where everything is because you don't

310
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,120
have the esm project uh because that

311
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,279
last problem secondly you can't because

312
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,380
I've actually asked a bunch of scanning

313
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,300
companies now what would happen if I

314
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,640
wanted to turn on oh I don't know a

315
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
couple of billion IPS call it four

316
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,660
billion just bam turn them on what would

317
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,300
happen and the answer is they can't they

318
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,279
literally cannot do it they might be

319
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,860
able to do thousands uh more customers

320
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,779
you know maybe a million couple million

321
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,880
more on a stretch basis that they really

322
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,980
had to in a pinch but if you're talking

323
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,899
about a billion all of a sudden all

324
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,459
their infrastructure just falls down it

325
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,760
just cannot work so uh it's not it's

326
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
just not practical you just can't do it

327
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,940
but even if you wanted to you couldn't

328
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,260
afford it it's way too expensive it's

329
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,459
unfathomably way too expensive to start

330
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,079
scanning all of your infrastructure so

331
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,440
unless the costs come wildly down

332
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,579
somehow like we figure out how to

333
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,620
commoditize scanning in general it's

334
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,779
it's not going to happen and then even

335
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,459
if you wanted to now you end up with all

336
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,200
these bones and I already told you that

337
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,579
your people aren't qualified to be doing

338
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,019
what they're doing they're they're the

339
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,000
guy with a knife in the emergency room

340
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,560
just stabbing at somebody hoping it's

341
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,300
going to do something right they don't

342
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,820
have the technical capability to do this

343
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,220
let alone fix these new vulnerabilities

344
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,779
that have just come out and these

345
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,279
vulnerabilities are going to be crazy

346
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,360
they're going to be every kind of

347
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
vulnerability because they're these are

348
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,320
all the old exploits from Antiquity

349
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,579
because these are machines you haven't

350
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,079
played with in a long time they're just

351
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,820
been sitting out there forever these are

352
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,100
old Antiquated boxes that are very frail

353
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,660
your employees are definitely not

354
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,399
qualified to manage these things

355
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,680
everybody happy so far

356
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,380
by the way I I decided because I gave

357
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,839
this presentation earlier uh last week

358
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,700
you have the opportunity to give a

359
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,220
really like uplifting talk a really kind

360
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,959
of like let's get to the meat of things

361
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,519
kind of thing and you know kind of a

362
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,200
downer talk so I'll let you decide which

363
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,660
one this is

364
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,220
so next

365
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,180
um

366
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,440
so

367
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,839
I've been harping about this thing at

368
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,760
this conference I just went back and

369
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,920
checked the uh the old footage since

370
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
2014 so this is this is eight years of

371
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,720
me talking about this and this has not

372
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,760
gotten better uh but I finally figured

373
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,079
out a way to explain it that might

374
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,300
actually resonate a little bit better so

375
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,740
what does a high a critical a red a 9.4

376
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,899
94 or a 83 or whatever a five a c minus

377
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,440
a B plus a CVSs two eight or whatever

378
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,160
what do these things actually mean what

379
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,839
do they actually mean and I'm serious

380
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,820
because when I look at those scores I'm

381
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,260
confused like well what does that mean

382
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,360
in Context of this of this actual box

383
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,459
because if this box is sitting here

384
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,220
unconnected to the internet am I really

385
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,660
worried about somebody running a command

386
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,100
injection from the public internet no

387
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,440
that makes no sense it's it's it's

388
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,779
irrelevant to the business at whole and

389
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,820
you can you can prove this because it

390
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,680
turns out that all of these things all

391
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,720
these rating systems are not correlated

392
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,700
to losses if you look at the insurance

393
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,800
claims so this is just garbage

394
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,779
information it's actually kind of

395
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,700
running you astray

396
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,500
um and I don't mean like like slightly

397
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,959
astray I mean it might be exactly the

398
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,339
wrong thing to be working on you might

399
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,440
actually be working on things that you

400
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,300
shouldn't be working on and furthermore

401
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,220
a lot of things that might be somewhat

402
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,139
low from whatever these random scores

403
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,600
tend to mean uh might actually be

404
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,639
extremely critical because it's like on

405
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,260
your home page or something and if

406
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,399
you're a Facebook or something and

407
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,779
you're massive that might be worth

408
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,000
fixing because you have to you have to

409
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
assign a risk not just of the bad thing

410
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,860
happening but also in context of the

411
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,600
business or whatever the loss potential

412
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,060
is so that's always bugged me about it I

413
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,459
call it now stop light security and this

414
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:48,959
thing has got to go

415
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,779
um and it's got to go quickly but I'll

416
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,399
explain why

417
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,720
um because a lot of people still don't

418
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,220
believe me when I talk about this I

419
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,019
actually have math now to prove how

420
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,120
broken this model actually is

421
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,980
so let's say you have a vulnerability

422
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,959
that's average vulnerability that's like

423
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,760
five on the vulnerability scale whatever

424
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
that means from one to ten

425
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,079
so let's say the average full

426
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,019
replacement in eBay of a laptop of some

427
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,760
old crappy laptop that's an average

428
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,920
laptop you find in some you know stodgy

429
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,180
old company or something is about 100

430
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,000
bucks right this is not this is not like

431
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,279
a really dangerous thing that this thing

432
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,540
happens like you could literally throw

433
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,180
it in the trash no one had even notice

434
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,639
um so are you telling me that the worst

435
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,320
vulnerability on the planet the world

436
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,760
ending vulnerability the only one we're

437
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,860
all worried about is only worth double

438
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,019
that it's only worth two hundred dollars

439
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,880
does that make any sense whatsoever

440
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,160
because that's what the math says if you

441
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,839
say one thing is a five and the worst

442
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,160
thing that could possibly ever be true

443
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
is a 10 and the average replacement cost

444
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,680
of your equipment is a hundred dollars

445
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,540
that doesn't make sense it's obviously

446
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,959
not 200 it's some number wildly more and

447
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,519
when I talk with data analysts who

448
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,199
actually build these algorithms out and

449
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,339
like to try to come up with these

450
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,740
numbers they'll do crazy things like

451
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,019
multiply numbers by 1.3 I'm like where

452
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,459
did this number come from and like I

453
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,180
don't know

454
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,920
you want to change it and I'm like what

455
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,720
do you mean want to change it where did

456
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,820
it come from and they're like well you

457
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,380
know it sounds it looked good but I'm

458
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,880
like well what happens if it's a hundred

459
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,079
thousand dollar loss like well we could

460
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,699
put a multiplier in there I'm like no no

461
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,860
no no no no no no no no no no no it's

462
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,600
not exponential just because you choose

463
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,860
it to be exponential it's got to have

464
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,680
some business context and and honestly

465
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
that's where all the best thinking is in

466
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,980
this industry is like well we can make

467
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,440
it a bigger number like no you can't do

468
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,240
that I mean not reliably not get good

469
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,820
data out of it so here's another one and

470
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,860
this this one is even more terrifying to

471
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,360
me um

472
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,100
so if you get a whole bunch of A's

473
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,980
whatever that means and you get one F

474
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,019
and this is the world ending F this is

475
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,639
the worst thing we all agree is the

476
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,959
worst worst worst thing on the internet

477
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,459
this will absolutely shut your company

478
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,040
down it turns out you need around 10 A's

479
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,180
where you average it out and it's an a

480
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,880
um and so what that means you're

481
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,920
actually incented to grow your attack

482
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,040
surface and get more very slight

483
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,559
vulnerabilities to average out the F's

484
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,020
so that you get an A

485
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,699
do you see the problem with that that is

486
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,579
insane that is insane the stoplight

487
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,419
security is garbage it's got to go

488
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,939
um so the descent into madness let's

489
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,640
talk about wafts for a second

490
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,540
all right

491
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,980
you thought this

492
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,240
oh it gets worse uh okay so first of all

493
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,320
your team doesn't have the skill

494
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,900
necessary to run them they don't uh if

495
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,940
they once did 10 years ago let's say

496
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,039
when there was reasonably good expertise

497
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,140
at the low end of the of where you'd put

498
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,940
an average analyst in the job position

499
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,620
of actually running a laugh

500
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,539
you don't have that now they are not

501
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,340
that qualified now which means and

502
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,600
actually running a laugh is a little

503
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,740
complicated because you actually kind of

504
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,179
have to understand how web applications

505
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,559
work you have to understand web

506
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,700
application flows you have to understand

507
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,559
how your company works and its business

508
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,320
model because if you just turn off you

509
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,880
know people being able to upload

510
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,860
JavaScript into web pages you would have

511
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,600
broken all of eBay back in the day right

512
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
that's probably not a wise business

513
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,820
decision so second problem is wavs

514
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,559
themselves are complicated you can

515
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,260
actually break functionality in very

516
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,080
strange ways without realizing using a

517
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,600
WAFF and it's those kinds of things that

518
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,820
will like sneak up on you yet six months

519
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,919
a year later like why are we getting no

520
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,620
analytics on this website well you know

521
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,240
we put in this cross-site request

522
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,100
forgery token or something and it broke

523
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,260
everything and like well you can't just

524
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,580
arbitrarily start adding stuff without

525
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,559
knowing every bit and bite and really

526
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,299
understanding HP headers understanding

527
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,980
what happens if you insert a Content

528
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,260
security policy for God's sakes uh you

529
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,580
can actually break a lot of stuff like

530
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,080
Google analytics just disappeared for

531
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,940
six months like we can't get that data

532
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,620
back it's not like it's gonna magically

533
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,480
appear if you just fix something

534
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,960
uh they're also very very expensive on a

535
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,299
per like machine basis so if you want to

536
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,760
laugh everything the most hilarious

537
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,039
thing is you just can't you literally

538
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,020
can't it's not just because they're

539
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,059
expensive though so I talked with the

540
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,380
biggest WAFF vendors in the world I'm

541
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,240
like well what would it take to laugh I

542
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,760
don't know like four billion IPS uh and

543
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,799
they're like you just you like you can't

544
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,480
I mean it's not we'd have to fill up

545
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
like all the Amazon data centers with

546
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,620
just wafs to do that like it would be it

547
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,299
would be totally impossible

548
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,799
um which I guess is what cloudflare is

549
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,340
trying to do but uh I mean it's it's

550
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,500
just we're not gonna get there you know

551
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,360
we'll get somewhere we'll have some

552
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,500
things we're not going to get there

553
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,419
we're not going to whack everything

554
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:37,919
but

555
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,600
so I've been thinking about this for a

556
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,620
while

557
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,580
um if I have a new o day or like 0.000

558
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,799
one day like it just just just just came

559
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,679
out and I fire it at a WAAF at the exact

560
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,660
same time that I also fire a patch of

561
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,539
the weft so like I'm patching it and I'm

562
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,580
a firing exploit the exact same time

563
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,780
well who wins uh like like it seems like

564
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,400
the patch should go through relatively

565
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,260
quickly how how quickly should it go

566
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,480
through well it turns out the time it

567
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,880
takes to even log into a WAFF is if

568
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,260
you're doing it over like SSH or

569
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,080
something is around a second just around

570
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,000
a second

571
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,980
um to apply the patch the back plane

572
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,919
it's multi-seconds uh two seconds at the

573
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,919
minimum let's say for me to fire my

574
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,299
exploit at that at through the WAFF is

575
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:29,940
0.02 seconds so I am two orders of

576
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,460
magnitude faster than you can possibly

577
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,460
patch so it doesn't matter how good your

578
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,080
WAFF is you're never ever ever going to

579
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,360
beat that o day so this isn't the right

580
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,480
way to handle like brand new exploits

581
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,679
especially if somebody's very quick

582
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,660
about turning it against you so that's

583
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,580
kind of a minor issue but it's still one

584
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,780
that I have not heard a good solution

585
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,700
for so

586
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,240
back to No One prioritizing risk so

587
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,160
you're all like no but I am I really

588
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,660
feel like I am you're not

589
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,580
uh so if you don't know where your

590
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,200
assets are

591
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,360
you aren't scanning everything which is

592
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,100
important because what if all of those

593
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,360
bones that are going to get you

594
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,100
compromised are on the machines that

595
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,380
you're not scanning are on ports that

596
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,240
you don't even know exist on machines

597
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,820
that you haven't seen in years or no one

598
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,320
even knows exists because the people who

599
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,260
used to manage them are long gone right

600
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,000
so how do you know that you're fixing

601
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,740
the ones that should be fixed if you

602
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,600
don't know where the other ones are that

603
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,640
should be fixed how are you measuring

604
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
them against each other if you don't

605
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,240
know what to measure against so you're

606
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
not doing risk you're just guessing

607
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,620
you're maybe making good guesses in some

608
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,200
cases but still it's just a guess and

609
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,760
you're not prioritizing the risks

610
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,919
according to the business needs

611
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,640
to me this is not the answer this is not

612
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,460
a risk-based approach to security if you

613
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,440
don't know where your assets are and

614
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,059
that you know there are vulnerable

615
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,620
assets out there that you aren't

616
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,780
scanning then you're effectively just

617
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,600
saying I hope I quit first

618
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,539
right I hope I get the hell out of this

619
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,299
company before anybody notices because

620
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,820
this is going to go terribly wrong so

621
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,380
this is the whole you write three

622
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,520
letters thing I don't know if you heard

623
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,860
this anecdote but like basically you you

624
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,080
gotta get out of this company or blame

625
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,000
it on the last guy because oh I just got

626
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,620
here like two months ago I was like oh

627
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,080
thank God but you basically have got to

628
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,220
get out of that company as quickly as

629
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,500
possible if this is your plan which is

630
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,360
not a very good one

631
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,299
so our current conversations that we

632
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:31,559
have uh with Executives uh so this would

633
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,480
be like an average conversation you just

634
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,280
might have if you walk in if you're the

635
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,360
You Know Chief Information Security

636
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,700
Officer talking to CFO you'd say well

637
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,260
we've got two command injections three

638
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,600
SQL injections one preset scripting or

639
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,340
request forgery and misconfigure HD

640
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,840
access file on Apache so one fifty

641
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,919
thousand dollars to change our grade

642
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,020
from a B minus to a B plus

643
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,059
and like what the hell are you talking

644
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,820
about like you sound like you're an

645
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,679
idiot I mean you sound like you're just

646
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,480
speaking technobabble just to piss me

647
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,140
off so I I went and I talked to this uh

648
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,900
board member uh who became the CEO of a

649
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,120
company in a security company of all

650
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,360
things and I like so how do you feel

651
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,860
when people come to your office and they

652
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,240
say stuff like this like what what

653
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,220
what's the impression you got he's like

654
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,960
well as a board member I kind of thought

655
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,940
it was funny and I just sort of laugh

656
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,260
them off and I just kind of wanted them

657
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,480
out of the room uh like like they're

658
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,100
they're funny because they're they're

659
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,419
like really passionate about what

660
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,860
they're doing but they obviously aren't

661
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,179
moving the needle to the company at all

662
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,240
so just get them out right uh so that's

663
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,100
obviously not great uh that was his

664
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,840
impression at the time just get him out

665
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,340
of the room as quickly as possible give

666
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,080
them the five or ten minutes to give his

667
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,640
couple of dumb slides with his graphs

668
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,559
that don't mean anything uh and then get

669
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,799
them out of here right uh now as a CEO

670
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,380
he's like they absolutely royally piss

671
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,179
me off they come in there they they

672
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:49,860
start telling me these crazy things that

673
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,840
are happening and like you have no idea

674
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,760
what you're talking about and from the

675
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,320
cfo's perspective it's even worse

676
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,940
because we don't understand what their

677
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,039
job actually is they are the real risk

678
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,440
officers of the company like we are just

679
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,419
the security risk officers of companies

680
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,340
they have to do all the other kinds of

681
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,780
risk and there's a lot of other kinds of

682
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,600
risk out there uh so what I would prefer

683
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,120
is if we had this conversation we have

684
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,679
two million dollars of expected loss

685
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,240
over the next 12 months and like fifty

686
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,860
thousand dollars to remediate that and

687
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,659
so they're not going to go cool they're

688
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,640
going to say let me see your math like I

689
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,840
want to see how you came up with those

690
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,659
numbers and the numbers should be

691
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,580
um on the expected value of law should

692
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,780
be something like the cost of

693
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,419
remediation pre-compromise

694
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,100
um is the cost so that's the fifty

695
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,200
thousand dollars uh to remedy the threat

696
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,020
against the expected uh value of lost

697
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,419
post compromise which is a mix of how

698
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,580
bad the thing is times likelihood that's

699
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,799
it that's the math and so if you can get

700
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,799
anywhere near correct answers anywhere

701
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,539
near they're going to say well that's

702
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,400
good enough or they'll say we'll come

703
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,780
back with better numbers or like

704
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,460
something like well our fully leaded

705
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,559
loaded head count is 120 an hour not 100

706
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,299
an hour or whatever they'll correct your

707
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,220
math but it's math

708
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,320
so I I went down and I sat down with

709
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,360
this guy who's uh outside counsel for

710
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,299
Samsung also a CPA also a lawyer he's an

711
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,280
amazing guy I just love this guy and I

712
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,559
sat him down with my math and I said all

713
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,659
right so let's say I have a bunch of

714
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,520
phones and I had like a little toy model

715
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,780
of like 10 vulnerabilities on this

716
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,000
little graph uh plotted against each

717
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,220
other and uh and I said okay which one

718
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,539
of these would you fix and I was

719
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,220
expecting them to say anything above the

720
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,960
efficient Frontier of a 45 degree angle

721
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,720
curve which basically says if it costs

722
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,419
you more than it uh that it's going to

723
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,279
cost the company to fix then don't

724
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,960
bother right is what I was expecting to

725
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,620
say

726
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,480
and uh he said well what kind of company

727
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,559
is it I'm like oh it's like a little

728
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,820
tiny toy company it doesn't really

729
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,740
matter he's like okay I'd fix every

730
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,860
single volt I'm like what no I totally

731
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,539
missed it hold on let me re-explain what

732
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,100
I'm talking about so I re-explained the

733
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,900
whole thing to him and he's like yeah I

734
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,820
got you Robert uh I'd fix every single

735
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,100
ball I'm like okay I up again let

736
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,260
me let me try it again he's like no no I

737
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,279
understand what you're saying I don't

738
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,299
think you understand what's happening

739
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,980
though you said it was a tiny little

740
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,720
company right and I said yeah why would

741
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,860
that matter he's like well that means

742
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,720
it's pre-public that means it's got a

743
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,580
valuation attached to it and if you just

744
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,320
pick like an average multiple like 10x

745
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,120
or something then all of a sudden all

746
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,600
your bones shift up by 10x and suddenly

747
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,400
everything fits above the efficient

748
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,799
Frontier of that curve I'm like holy

749
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,320
 uh of course you're right of course

750
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,179
you're right uh that's exactly how

751
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,039
business thinks about things like and so

752
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,679
we can finally start providing value to

753
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,840
companies truly we can actually increase

754
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,059
the valuation of companies

755
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,460
like we are actually fundamental to

756
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,620
improving the value of companies really

757
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,900
really really it's not if we

758
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,940
can get the math right

759
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,140
so

760
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,919
eventually someday I want csos to decide

761
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,080
what to not fix

762
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,580
not to fix because there's a lot of

763
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,659
vulnerabilities that are not worth

764
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,059
fixing and you know that to be true you

765
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,440
know there are some bones that you could

766
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,299
spend all week working on and it's not

767
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,159
going to change the needle at all bad

768
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,900
guys aren't using them they're internal

769
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,140
machines it just doesn't matter uh but I

770
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,419
also want csos to understand that they

771
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,860
can improve the value of the company

772
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,720
they can actually shift the entire value

773
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,539
of the company up because only then can

774
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,279
they say well you added a whole bunch of

775
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,080
more machines you bought a company let's

776
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,299
say well great I need like 20 more

777
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,159
people you just increase the risk to

778
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,080
this company by hundreds of millions of

779
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,120
dollars like I need more people to go

780
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,679
manage this and they'll go yeah that

781
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,480
actually makes sense like I can actually

782
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,760
see the ROI Associated if I give you 20

783
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,860
people suddenly a risk instead of going

784
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,419
up 100 million dollars it only went up

785
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,520
20 million dollars or something that's a

786
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,279
great Roi that's an important investment

787
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,480
to the company because it actually

788
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,340
improves our valuation

789
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,020
so

790
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,940
cyber Insurance we've been talking about

791
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,740
this one for a while I am here to add

792
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,760
more gloom and doom to your radar so you

793
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,620
know you need cyber insurance and if you

794
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,760
don't know you need it I'm going to

795
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,700
explain why your customers every

796
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,919
customer that you have for the most part

797
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,539
is going to require that you have cyber

798
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,279
insurance going forward they're going to

799
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,600
say something like you have to have a

800
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,580
minimum of a million dollar per incident

801
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,799
and three to five maybe a 10 million

802
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,500
dollar total policy uh and if they're a

803
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,640
really big customer they're going to ask

804
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,799
to be named as the first to be paid out

805
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,539
in the case of a breach or something

806
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,640
right if you've never seen these

807
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,559
contracts go down to your sales team I

808
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,120
promise you they've seen these contracts

809
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,760
they all exist which means your entire

810
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,740
net revenue is based on you having cyber

811
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,980
Insurance very very important so we all

812
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,299
know that you aren't documenting things

813
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,740
you're not instrumenting things properly

814
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,820
because you don't have the right people

815
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,320
and you don't have esm and you're not

816
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,220
scanning everything and you're not

817
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,539
laughing everything and all the problems

818
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,340
I talked about before right so you're

819
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,659
going to get compromised that's what's

820
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:37,679
going to happen you're going to get

821
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,960
popped eventually it's kind of an

822
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,279
eventuality and by the way don't feel

823
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,919
bad about that go down to any Fortune

824
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,960
500 go to the basement down to the IT

825
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,880
team and just look at the Stacks and

826
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,559
stacks and Stacks and stacks of machines

827
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,140
they're all running slow or have a

828
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,659
pop-up or they lost some data and they

829
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,100
can't get it back or whatever all those

830
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,480
things have malware every one of them

831
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,940
all of them have malware so anybody who

832
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,320
says that like oh we never got

833
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,240
compromised that's absolutely

834
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,620
they just go down there just talk to

835
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,000
your it team of course you're

836
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,620
compromised you're all compromised 100

837
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,539
of the time every one of those Fortune

838
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,159
500s is compromised every one of

839
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,140
them unless they're doing some drastic

840
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,580
stuff they're they're going to be

841
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,020
compromised

842
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,880
um so you will get breached oh and by

843
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,440
the way the reason we know that this is

844
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,820
true as opposed to just think it's true

845
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,039
is during the pandemic

846
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,659
um one of my buddies who does a lot of

847
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,419
Internet Telemetry based on malware he

848
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,000
noticed that as soon as people started

849
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,559
working from home all these companies

850
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,600
were forced to find laptops out of the

851
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,760
blue where are we find laptops oh here's

852
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
a stack of old laptops that's great just

853
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,600
go up there to start throwing them at

854
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,760
people and all of a sudden all these

855
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,919
Antiquated old pieces of malware that

856
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,960
were long lost to history or suddenly

857
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,940
beaconing out from these networks like

858
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,399
why is this happening like oh these old

859
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,980
machines are all over the place so this

860
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,539
is definitely happening

861
00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:00,080
so uh so you will uh you will

862
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,880
you will be proven negligent but that's

863
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,100
okay because what's going to happen is

864
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,220
the insurance providers will say we're

865
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,840
going to pay out anyway they're going to

866
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
give you the money anyway because they

867
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,260
want this to be a real business they

868
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,640
really want cyber Insurance to exist

869
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,500
it's a real thing they want you to

870
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,640
believe it's a real thing and the only

871
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,620
way for them to get the news out that

872
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,940
cyber insurance is a real thing is to

873
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,500
pay people

874
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,179
um unless it's like a nation state or

875
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,500
something that's directly attacking you

876
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,140
like like a specific version of stuxnet

877
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,600
that was purpose built just for you by

878
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,100
you know some foreign Nation or

879
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,240
something you're going to get money

880
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,740
you're going to get your money back

881
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,539
okay so you're gonna trigger the claim

882
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:37,860
and you're gonna go yeah please give me

883
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,600
my money back and what they're gonna do

884
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,779
is say great here's your money but you

885
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,240
now have a timer that timer is from now

886
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,580
till the end of your policy date because

887
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,620
after that point you're not going to get

888
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,539
Cyber Insurance twice

889
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,799
you're not going to get it second time

890
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,240
if you remember the very first bullet

891
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,860
you need it because if you don't have it

892
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,840
your customers are going to say you're

893
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,520
in breach of contract or they're not

894
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,320
going to renew

895
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,340
um because they're going to ask for your

896
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,600
insurance policy they're going to ask to

897
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,980
be named on the insurance policy that

898
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,220
doesn't any exist anymore so at first I

899
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,260
was like okay well this this isn't like

900
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,539
completely true I hope this isn't true

901
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,940
and I started talking about this uh back

902
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,100
in Germany and I met some guy he's like

903
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,840
Robert this is more true than you know

904
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,640
what happened is we triggered our

905
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,159
insurance policy and we went to 15

906
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,080
different insurance providers before we

907
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,179
found one who is willing to give it to

908
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,340
us but only under the guise of we had to

909
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,760
buy this enormous Mega policy this like

910
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,919
way way way way bigger than anything

911
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:36,919
we'd ever want in any other circumstance

912
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,120
huge insurance policy uh that was 10 of

913
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,520
the entire revenue of the company

914
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,760
just to get it right and the only reason

915
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,200
they got it was because of the all the

916
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,520
other insurance they didn't even get it

917
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,380
for the I mean I'm sure the company

918
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,760
didn't understand that they were

919
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,080
accidentally giving them cyber insurance

920
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,700
that they should not have been giving

921
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,679
them that's how hard it is to get Cyber

922
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,640
insurance

923
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,520
so you both have to have it and you also

924
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,559
have to not use it

925
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,880
do you see what I'm saying which means

926
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,960
you actually have to do security again

927
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,279
you can't just rely on Cyber insurance

928
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,419
anymore

929
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,399
it's weird right they're kind of making

930
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,039
us do our job so they will run our

931
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,779
industry by the way uh I know that

932
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,039
people are talking about this a little

933
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,960
bit so I actually talked to the Cyber

934
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,480
Insurance uh industry quite a bit uh

935
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,940
like chub AIG Easter ants

936
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,220
um and uh SCI Insurance in particular

937
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,539
the woman that runs that I had a good

938
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,220
conversation with her I asked her like

939
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,380
do you feel comfortable with the idea

940
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,600
that you can tell the difference between

941
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,220
good product and bad product she's like

942
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,440
yeah yeah I think so I'm like okay do

943
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,659
you feel comfortable with the idea that

944
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,460
uh there is such a thing as a good

945
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,260
policy and a bad policy just like yep

946
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,700
I'm like do you feel comfortable

947
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,000
reviewing people's policies yes do you

948
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,640
feel comfortable writing policy she's

949
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,260
like no because there's liability

950
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,000
associated with that I'm like okay so

951
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,559
the only difference between what you're

952
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,539
willing to do and not only do is you're

953
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,159
willing to give all of the liability

954
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,380
back to the client there's you're still

955
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,520
going to control whether they have good

956
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,899
policies or not you're just not going to

957
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,279
write it for them and if there's

958
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,740
anything bad in there at all they're on

959
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,600
the they're on the hook not you that's

960
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,399
just good business I mean they're going

961
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,740
to run our industry they're going to

962
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,019
tell everybody what to buy and how to

963
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,600
install it and how to run it uh pretty

964
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,100
much everything you want to know is

965
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,600
going to come from that one

966
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,700
because we're not doing our job

967
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,000
so uh briefly to paraphrase the problems

968
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,260
and a couple of other things I want to

969
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,200
talk about uh we have talent issues uh

970
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,419
we're not we don't have any anymore or

971
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,039
very few people are coming up that are

972
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,860
very good the CSO instead of suck uh no

973
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,840
one knows what they own uh no one wants

974
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,940
to scan anything no wax company can scan

975
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,860
everything uh can protect anything

976
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,860
rather uh that's actually a typo uh et

977
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,480
cetera et cetera right all this stuff is

978
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,899
broken this is terrible and this is this

979
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,880
is kind of I think we're all okay with

980
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,500
this which is even weirder like

981
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,940
everyone's going through their day going

982
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,519
yep I mean I have a job and and my

983
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,159
vulner report says I gotta B plus

984
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,779
whatever that means and so I'm good

985
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,600
because I'm not going to get fired today

986
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,980
uh and that's that's just kind of how

987
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,839
things are and you're occasionally

988
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,159
forced to go fix something which you

989
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,899
probably aren't fixing the dev team is

990
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,520
forced to go figure it out and and

991
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,679
that's okay that's that's that's our job

992
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,139
that's what we do now uh and and frankly

993
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,300
we're not helping our own industry we're

994
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,399
not actually pushing the needle and the

995
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,399
business is at best rolling their eyes

996
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,520
at us saying please God can SEC devops

997
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,139
take over can someone else who

998
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,540
understands can i t do Securities job

999
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,460
for them can the insurance company do it

1000
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,080
because anyone could do a better job

1001
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,879
than we're doing that's where things are

1002
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,780
today

1003
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,239
so things I intentionally left out

1004
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,159
during this but I think it was worth

1005
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,980
mentioning just sort of as a side so

1006
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,719
there's a lot of talk about shifting

1007
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,739
left

1008
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:50,520
um

1009
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,820
I think shifting left

1010
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,219
probably does work I think it does I

1011
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,320
don't have good data on it but that

1012
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,400
doesn't mean anything it's it's

1013
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,200
relatively small and that's actually the

1014
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,780
problem with it uh if it were bigger if

1015
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,460
a lot of people used it if it was used

1016
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,320
for a long time I might have better data

1017
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,000
on it I could I could say definitively

1018
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,099
if it worked or doesn't work uh but what

1019
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,859
I do know is that we have 20 years of

1020
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,240
technical debt

1021
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,520
which means that if you install it today

1022
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
everywhere you're still only affecting

1023
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,200
Day Zero and Beyond everything before

1024
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,599
that you're still screwed so while it

1025
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,160
might work it's only going to work from

1026
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,740
now on or whatever places you happen to

1027
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,020
run it on so I'm not saying don't do it

1028
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,780
I'm not saying that I am saying that it

1029
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,300
doesn't fix any of the problems that

1030
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,940
currently exist which is an enormous

1031
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,460
amount of problems I hope you agree uh

1032
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,619
so SEC devops since I mentioned it and

1033
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,599
it's all the hotness

1034
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,300
I again think this does work but

1035
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,339
possibly not for the reason most people

1036
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,320
think it works I think this actually

1037
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,380
just shifts where the problems lie and

1038
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,940
shifts the attack surface elsewhere

1039
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,220
which is good in the sense that it stops

1040
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,780
people from attacking the things that

1041
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,460
they're used to attacking and it makes

1042
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,320
it harder there's usually like one more

1043
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,359
layer between you and the thing and

1044
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:07,920
sometimes it has some shift left stuff

1045
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,079
built into it and that's good because I

1046
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,700
think I don't have data for it but I

1047
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,320
think it's good

1048
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,720
um and so that obfuscation although

1049
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,099
people say it's not a security measure

1050
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,720
it definitely is a security measure in

1051
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,760
certain contexts I think this is one of

1052
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,960
those contexts

1053
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,200
uh and then internal threats so while I

1054
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,000
do agree internal threats are real if

1055
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,079
you look at the insurance claims

1056
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,420
associated with it they're small uh

1057
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,940
compared to external threats so yes I do

1058
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,200
think you should care about it because I

1059
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,579
do think there's bad things that can

1060
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,200
happen and furthermore things like

1061
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,880
nation states if you if you're like a

1062
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,859
government or something this whole deck

1063
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,720
isn't for you uh because you don't care

1064
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,839
about the money aspect of things uh but

1065
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,359
if you're at all in retail or anything

1066
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,660
that transacts in cash uh this is kind

1067
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,520
of a big deal and so if that's your

1068
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,619
major concern internal threats unless

1069
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:56,940
you're talking about something like the

1070
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,980
secret sauce like the Campbell Soup

1071
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,040
recipe or something or the coke recipe

1072
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,740
uh it probably doesn't matter nearly as

1073
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,960
much statistically speaking as external

1074
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,400
threats

1075
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,740
let's say you wanted to do it in a

1076
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,359
microcosm as opposed to a macro

1077
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,560
environment

1078
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,359
you might say that there are certain

1079
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,920
machines that are worth more because

1080
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,740
they are in uh the production land let's

1081
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,079
say uh or because they have a certain

1082
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,560
amount of pii on them or because uh they

1083
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,119
have an attack chain that is attached to

1084
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,140
a bunch of other things that are

1085
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,880
important those things that are

1086
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,280
important have a net value of blah the

1087
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,839
percentage likelihood of attacking one

1088
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,000
from another is whatever it is you know

1089
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,700
10 50 whatever the number is uh then you

1090
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,320
aggregate the score and then that comes

1091
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,619
up with a value the problem is this is

1092
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,540
none of this is automated none of this

1093
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,920
is automated because what I just

1094
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,260
described is great in theory until you

1095
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,579
actually sit down and practice and

1096
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,240
actually try to do the math on paper

1097
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,800
holy cow I mean it's enormous and it's

1098
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,839
sort of self-referential like really

1099
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,060
complicated math actually so I would not

1100
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,980
recommend ever trying to do this and by

1101
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,240
the way this is actually my biggest

1102
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,460
complaint with Fair the guys who wrote

1103
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,560
Fair are geniuses absolutely brilliant

1104
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,000
brilliant people I really really like

1105
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,740
what they've done the problem it is

1106
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,119
clearly written from an academic

1107
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,220
perspective if you actually try and I've

1108
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,839
known multiple companies now have tried

1109
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,640
to implement fare and they get really

1110
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,320
they get stuck they're like okay well

1111
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,359
like well what's up what's the how much

1112
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,240
Pia is on this machine well have Joe Bob

1113
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,400
go down there and type them type in some

1114
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,020
commands Joe Bob doesn't have access

1115
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,180
well who does that well Jim I think has

1116
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,400
access no he's on vacation and like

1117
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,960
three weeks later you get the answer to

1118
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,180
one question you know what I mean and it

1119
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,520
and so if Theory it works it's just in

1120
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,560
practice it's way too clunky and there

1121
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,780
are way too many moving parts so I think

1122
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,520
the answer is there needs to be a piece

1123
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,160
of automation built into everything that

1124
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,079
we're doing that basically pulls in this

1125
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,540
information and provides a relative

1126
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,940
value so

1127
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,820
people will very much dislike this but

1128
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,040
you can value assets just like you can

1129
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,200
value a car so if I go up and I say this

1130
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,359
car this you know old jalopy it's worth

1131
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,040
a million dollars you're like no it

1132
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,320
isn't like no it isn't it just isn't

1133
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,119
worth that well why isn't it worth that

1134
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,339
well we all have both an instinctual

1135
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,079
knowledge of what jalopies are worth but

1136
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,940
also you go look at Kelley Blue Book

1137
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,200
well where did they get that information

1138
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,060
well they got it from resale value they

1139
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,380
got it from this statistic and that

1140
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,260
statistics we can get close we can't get

1141
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,300
perfect but what if I were to tell you

1142
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,180
that you know JFK was at his body

1143
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,980
stashed in the in the thing and I've got

1144
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,720
all this like and there's half a ton of

1145
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,000
cocaine in there and whatever okay maybe

1146
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,800
it is worth that maybe it is actually

1147
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,660
worth a million dollars right so that

1148
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,000
context actually really really matters

1149
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,280
so you're gonna get it wrong and this is

1150
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,480
where people are not gonna like this

1151
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,800
they're not gonna like being wrong no

1152
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,540
one likes being wrong so it's going to

1153
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,680
be wrong in one in two completely

1154
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,420
different ways one is people are going

1155
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,859
to estimate the value of things are

1156
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:53,099
going to be way too high so an example

1157
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,339
would be like let's say a bunch of

1158
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,260
developers installed all types of stuff

1159
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,119
on this one machine so it's like lots of

1160
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,740
pii on it they're testing all the

1161
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,180
stuff's on there so I go in there and

1162
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,520
has lots of pii or something that looks

1163
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,859
like Pia anyway uh has a bunch of apps

1164
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,599
on it lots of services it's connected to

1165
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,680
a lot of things because it's a Dev

1166
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,060
environment but the full replacement

1167
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,160
cost is actually basically nothing they

1168
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,200
just you know just re-upload the docker

1169
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,240
install on this phone right it's exactly

1170
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,400
where it needs to be and so there's the

1171
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,380
full replacement cost is is basically

1172
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,000
nothing and I just told you it's worth

1173
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,680
billions of dollars or whatever right

1174
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,200
well obviously you can go in and tweak

1175
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,640
these knobs you have to be able to tweak

1176
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,160
the knobs on the low end you can get it

1177
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,500
wrong by like let's say like let's say

1178
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,300
it's like cisco.com or something and

1179
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,040
they have an API server that handles all

1180
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,680
transaction data well cisco.com makes

1181
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,060
about a billion dollars a year through

1182
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,040
their website one billion dollars a year

1183
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,599
but I'm looking at something that's like

1184
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,880
well it's this tiny little web interface

1185
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,320
it's like looks like it's running a

1186
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,520
patch or something and there's nothing

1187
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,040
on it I can't see anything on it well

1188
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,480
I'm gonna say it's worth virtually

1189
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,040
nothing but it's like it's worth a

1190
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,780
billion dollars to US if this thing goes

1191
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,099
down like it's really really important

1192
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,540
or some percentage of a billion dollars

1193
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,280
if it's down for some percentage of time

1194
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,500
so understanding the different variants

1195
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,900
of outages whether it's down is it

1196
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,119
really out or is it broken which would

1197
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,660
be really bad or is it

1198
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,339
um compromised we're actually able to

1199
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,680
extract data and hurt reputation so all

1200
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,839
these different variants of being down

1201
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,060
or out or damaged all have different

1202
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,220
sort of damage potential

1203
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,420
um

1204
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,780
long way to say it's complicated really

1205
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,220
really complicated

1206
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,599
but it doesn't help that no one in the

1207
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,400
room is working on it right no one in

1208
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,380
the room is working on this problem

1209
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,480
they're working on pieces of it possibly

1210
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,700
but not the whole thing like how do we

1211
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,780
get in front of this

1212
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,520
uh like I hear some people talking about

1213
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,260
the hiring problem like well you know

1214
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,760
we'll we'll start

1215
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,859
um like an internship program no no no

1216
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:49,440
you've just now increased more cost into

1217
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,480
companies who now have to train these

1218
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,460
interns who are not going to work for

1219
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,800
you they're going to see you and go that

1220
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,300
thank you for all that information and

1221
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,740
go work somewhere else like how does

1222
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,240
that help your company you've just taken

1223
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,160
people off the line to train people

1224
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,320
you've become a mini University and

1225
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,579
you're not going to get any value out of

1226
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,859
them because they have no expertise so

1227
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,140
like there's some real existential

1228
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,000
problems here and I don't actually have

1229
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,560
great answers for any one of these

1230
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,000
things but I do know that they're

1231
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,520
fundamentally broken from the ground up

1232
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,220
yes hey I didn't fully understand the

1233
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,180
example

1234
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,099
um you gave earlier about the early

1235
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:24,780
stage startup fix all the

1236
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,660
vulnerabilities okay so uh assuming you

1237
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,119
have a graph uh on the hor on the

1238
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,680
vertical axis you have the expected

1239
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,700
value of low loss post compromise which

1240
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,099
is the cost of the bad thing happening

1241
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:41,099
times likelihood on this axis on the

1242
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,500
vertical axis you had the cost of

1243
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,020
remediation pre-compromise so let's say

1244
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,280
you plot everything everything in the

1245
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,599
world fits on that graph every single

1246
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,160
thing like everything from nuclear

1247
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,180
submarines thank you very much

1248
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,800
everything from nuclear submarines

1249
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,240
getting taken over to you getting a

1250
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,980
paper cut everything fits on that graph

1251
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,640
somewhere right so uh let's say at a

1252
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,500
very small company that is not publicly

1253
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,020
traded uh they eventually want to go

1254
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,359
public or eventually get acquired uh

1255
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:07,619
which means that they're going to sell

1256
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,540
times earnings whatever that times

1257
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,760
earnings is but if they have liabilities

1258
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,619
in their company like a bunch of like

1259
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:15,480
exploits sitting out there that the

1260
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,599
potential acquirer can find using

1261
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,180
internal attack surface management and

1262
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,740
by the way this is already happening so

1263
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,240
congratulations if you aren't paying

1264
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,500
attention to this you are very much

1265
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,300
behind the times

1266
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,700
um then what's going to happen is the

1267
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,079
liabilities are going to count against

1268
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,380
your valuation so if they can say well

1269
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,960
the valuation of the liabilities also

1270
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,300
has a multiple it shifts everything up

1271
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,460
on the graph by whatever the multiple is

1272
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,440
not everything is a 10x multiple I've

1273
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,599
seen multiples as high as 30X in some

1274
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,579
cases just depends on the industry so

1275
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:48,900
just pick whatever multiple is in your

1276
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,680
industry

1277
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,520
part of what we build

1278
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,740
before you're going to lose that money

1279
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,180
yes yes

1280
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,520
um so okay brief aside because this is

1281
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,859
super interesting so let's let's assume

1282
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:03,900
I take snapshots of a company over time

1283
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,660
right Bam Bam Bam taking it over time

1284
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,300
um and then I leak out to the company

1285
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,560
that I'm potentially interested in

1286
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,780
buying them right so what's going to

1287
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,880
happen is one of four things nothing

1288
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,460
number two is they're gonna make some

1289
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,960
changes those changes are usually going

1290
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,920
to be patching they're going to be

1291
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,180
running around trying to install patches

1292
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,079
because they've never patched anything

1293
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,540
since the dawn of time which means they

1294
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,579
have like I.T hygiene issues which means

1295
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:28,140
they don't have good maturity which

1296
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,280
means you're gonna have to build a bunch

1297
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,599
of stuff on top of whatever they

1298
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,460
currently built they're just not a very

1299
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,079
well thought out company you're gonna

1300
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,400
have to do a lot of work to get them up

1301
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,079
to date that's okay a lot of companies

1302
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,760
have that problem it's it's not one

1303
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,920
that's really worth worrying about

1304
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,020
the other one is and this has happened

1305
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,060
and this has actually killed deals uh

1306
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,440
this is a real story I'm not making this

1307
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,020
up this is a real real real thing is

1308
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,240
there you'll see the amount of the

1309
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,760
infrastructure grow and it was

1310
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,160
correlated with fake companies that they

1311
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,700
had contracts with uh so it was it was

1312
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,380
designed to make it look like they have

1313
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,920
more customers than they had uh which is

1314
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,140
fraud

1315
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,020
um and so on the flip side of that you

1316
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,180
and this also is a real story this also

1317
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,740
really happened this also killed a

1318
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,200
billion dollar deal they saw the

1319
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,420
Telemetry going along and all of a

1320
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,980
sudden there's a drop and they're like

1321
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,079
well what happened what went away well

1322
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,520
what went away was all the gambling

1323
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,079
sites where the company actually makes

1324
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,359
all their money so they didn't want to

1325
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,920
tell them that they made all their money

1326
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,420
through gambling and when they went away

1327
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,920
when all those gambling sites went away

1328
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,900
well were you really making your money

1329
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,339
it looks like it's all coming from your

1330
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,319
customers you're getting it all from

1331
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,140
gambling so their books are all cooked

1332
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,700
uh this is what we call all corporate

1333
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,640
malfeasance and you can detect it from

1334
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,160
the public internet and big big big

1335
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,380
companies are starting to do this so if

1336
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,180
you plan to get bought someday you might

1337
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,899
want to think about that

1338
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,980
all right well thank you very much

1339
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,550
everybody
