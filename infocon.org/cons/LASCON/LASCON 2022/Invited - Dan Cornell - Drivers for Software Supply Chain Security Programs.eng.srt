1
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,080
foreign

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,850
[Music]

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,489
[Music]

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,520
[Music]

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,079
[Music]

6
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,120
all right so today I'm going to be

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,260
talking about

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,600
some research that we did at Coal Fire

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,319
looking into why organizations are

10
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,060
concerned about software supply chain

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,979
security and the actions that they are

12
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,860
looking to take and so this is a not

13
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,299
like a technical in the weeds talk

14
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,920
although I've got some links to other

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,900
materials like that available but this

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,400
is looking at for organizations like

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,080
what are the what are the forces inside

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,880
of these organizations that are causing

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,939
them both on the buyer side and on the

20
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,740
vendor side uh you know what are the

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,640
forces that are causing these

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,159
organizations to change their behavior a

23
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,320
little background about about myself

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,880
um I was one of the founders of denim

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,439
group we sold that to Coal Fire I'm now

26
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,420
a Coal Fire sizzo advisor where I work

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,400
with uh you know their client

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,680
organizations on cloud and application

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,360
security challenges

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,700
um I'm a former uh formerly ran Oasis

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,900
San Antonio that chapter is being

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,939
rebooted now uh for any am I here from

33
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,320
San Antonio

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,540
okay all right good uh so uh in uh

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,920
November in a couple weeks of November

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,939
they're going to be rebooting that

37
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,140
chapter

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,220
um and I was formerly on the membership

39
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,200
committee um and I'm a developer by

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,399
background

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,680
um you know with a lot of java stuff in

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,479
the mid to late 90s a server-side Java

43
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,979
stuff and then early.net stuff but

44
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,479
really what I've spent the last 15 or 20

45
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,598
years of my career doing is working with

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,599
organizations to help them deal with the

47
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,400
security impact of the software that

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
they're developing and deploying and so

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,599
I'm a developer that has come into the

50
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,700
world of security as opposed to someone

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,500
who maybe came up through the ranks from

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,180
like a systems Administration background

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,739
into pen testing or something like that

54
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,840
so that's neither good nor bad but

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,940
colors how I look at these issues as I'm

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,200
coming into this from a software

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
development background

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,340
uh so from an agenda standpoint I'm

59
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,360
going to talk a little bit about

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,239
software supply chain security and why

61
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,860
this is something that organizations are

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,480
concerned about this is something where

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,280
there's been uh you know certain

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,900
certainly there have been a lot of talk

65
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,940
about this you know back through you

66
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,760
know 2013 and earlier uh but it's really

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,800
come into greater Focus recently it

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,840
started to get a lot more attention

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,640
um and as we'll see from from I think

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,840
groups that are going to be influential

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,640
and really important in addressing these

72
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,260
concerns so I'll provide a little bit of

73
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,300
background and then I'll talk a little

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,220
bit about the survey methodology that we

75
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,500
use the kind of core data for this

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,780
presentation today came from a survey

77
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,080
that we did of 150 Executives at

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,319
software buying organizations as well as

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,019
150 Executives at software vendors or

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,599
software developing organizations and so

81
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,500
we'll talk a little bit about that

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,780
methodology and then go through the key

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,760
findings that came out of that so some

84
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,200
really interesting things interesting to

85
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,760
me hopefully interesting to you since

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
you all are here this morning

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,480
we're gonna be looking at who is driving

88
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
these initiatives both on the buy side

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
and on the sell side and how are these

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,099
impacting the purchasing process uh and

91
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,720
furthermore how is this going to impact

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,940
budgets and the security activities that

93
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,099
these organizations undertake uh in

94
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,599
order to address software supply chain

95
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,120
concerns uh then I'll provide some

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,480
analysis uh which is uh I'll caveat it's

97
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,879
strongly held or strong opinions that

98
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519
are weakly held again like this is I

99
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,720
think interesting data it's valuable

100
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
data came from a survey and we tried to

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,159
make that survey reflective not of you

102
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,780
know some kind of like schemey marketing

103
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,760
goal but of actually reflective of what

104
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,860
organizations are doing because we're

105
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,239
using that you know at Coal Fire we're

106
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,500
using that data to make decisions about

107
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,659
where we allocate resources as well so

108
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,100
I'll provide some analysis as well as

109
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,959
some thoughts on what I think they're

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,459
the next steps will be in the industry

111
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,440
uh and then you know have some time for

112
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,680
questions

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,479
oh just so to set the backdrop for this

114
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,520
and I'll talk a little bit about digital

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,800
transformation which is like a grossly

116
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,840
overused marketing term but I think it

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,300
does capture something that is really uh

118
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,419
important to understand about the way

119
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,100
organizations are viewing the world and

120
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,600
from the security standpoint are viewing

121
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,220
risk right

122
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,100
and so digital transformation the way I

123
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,020
see this is the market pressures that

124
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,880
are coming to organizations and saying

125
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
you need to iterate and innovate faster

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
right you need to be able to move faster

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,500
because other people in the industry

128
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,259
they're moving fast as well right and

129
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,820
we're seeing a greater integration both

130
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,800
internally to see you know are your

131
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,240
internal systems are they integrated

132
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,220
such that they work together in an

133
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,979
effective way as well as being able to

134
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,240
integrate the systems that you're

135
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,740
building with other external

136
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,060
stakeholders with you know trading

137
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,060
partners customers uh and and other

138
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,919
organizations like that and what we're

139
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,479
seeing is organizations are being forced

140
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,000
to serve new stakeholders right and so

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,979
that is the the Strategic backdrop like

142
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,900
that's what's happening in the world and

143
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,340
across the industry not the security

144
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,080
industry I'm talking the real world

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,120
where people you know make things and

146
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,440
sell things and drive cars and fly

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,100
planes and and things like that and we

148
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,979
talk a lot about risk in security which

149
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,660
which is good like that's appropriate to

150
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,039
be talking uh you know and trying to

151
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,360
look at things from a risk perspective

152
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,800
so are we allocating our limited

153
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,440
security resources in the correct area

154
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,240
but when you take a step above that at

155
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,699
the CEO level at the CFO level but at

156
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,500
the Strategic level like they're really

157
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,919
looking at actual risk right if you know

158
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,600
breaches are bad nobody likes having

159
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,880
breaches uh you know because you've got

160
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,080
a you know you've got to pay a ransom

161
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,060
you deal with a brand hit you've got to

162
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,560
you know replace people's credit cards

163
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,840
like that that all sucks right and and

164
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,820
and the danger of that happening is

165
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,639
obviously risk to the organization but

166
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,500
like a real risk of the organization is

167
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,479
what you see what happened to Kodak

168
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,880
right where they developed digital

169
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,979
photography right and they had

170
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,139
research and an understanding of here's

171
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,819
how digital photography is going to

172
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,600
progress and they got so Target fixated

173
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,419
on selling chemicals to people to

174
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,759
process normal film that digital

175
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,440
photography just went right by them

176
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,660
right so I would rather have a hundred

177
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,180
data breaches than to be the CEO of

178
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,860
Kodak that was like yeah this digital

179
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,600
stuff yeah whatever you know we own a

180
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,039
bunch of patents and we understand how

181
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,539
the industry is going to evolve let's

182
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,400
focus all our efforts on making uh on

183
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,960
making chemicals to develop software

184
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,860
yeah and Kodak is a cautionary tale for

185
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,300
CEO so if you if you want to think about

186
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,020
risk again breaches are bad being made

187
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,240
irrelevant by your industry and and

188
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,100
crushed by your competitors is really

189
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,080
bad right because that's where I mean

190
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
that's it's an existential these are

191
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,100
existential risks that the CEOs are

192
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,600
concerned about in their uh you know for

193
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,880
their organizations right

194
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
what's coming along with this is this

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,259
trend where you know products and

196
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,180
services are increasingly either solely

197
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,699
digital or rely on digital aspects in

198
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,620
order to have their delivery

199
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,539
Mark andreessen's great blog post from

200
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,340
however long ago that is now eight nine

201
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,960
years something like that where he talks

202
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,639
about software is eating the world uh

203
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,620
more recently Sachin Nadella from

204
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,660
Microsoft uh you know saying every

205
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,120
company is a software company right like

206
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,780
you you can't do the things that we need

207
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,180
to do in the world to serve customers

208
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,800
you can't do those without software and

209
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,440
without digital assets right and so what

210
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,940
we see is that organizations

211
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,000
increasingly rely on you know rely on

212
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,979
these things right and the Mandate is we

213
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,660
need to go faster and so what you see

214
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,400
coming out of that are cultural

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,740
movements like devops and devsecops

216
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,940
let's break down these barriers between

217
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,199
these groups so they can move faster

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,479
right let's adopt Cloud Technologies

219
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,680
because that's going to allow us to

220
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,660
scale or to do things in in different

221
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,800
ways that we couldn't do if we were

222
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,080
racking in second servers and just

223
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,840
overall what we're seeing is that

224
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,780
software is critical to the ongoing

225
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,020
success of or of every organization

226
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,020
right and so in a world where software

227
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,280
is critical to to decess of

228
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,759
organizations risk to software means

229
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,620
that you're exposing the risk to

230
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,900
businesses right and so this is uh this

231
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,700
is kind of like our time to shine as

232
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,320
Security Professionals or as cyber

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,700
Security Professionals this is this is

234
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,440
our time to shine

235
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,539
um and it's really an opportunity uh and

236
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,159
this is you know kind of an aside but

237
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,899
it's really an opportunity to be a risk

238
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,760
advisor to the business to say we know

239
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,380
you're going to be moving fast we know

240
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,120
you're going to be

241
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,580
um you know doing things in ways that

242
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,320
are different maybe make the traditional

243
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
security teams uncomfortable but this is

244
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,680
really an opportunity for security teams

245
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,320
to Rebrand themselves as risk advisors

246
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,880
to the business right that's the way

247
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,279
that you you know kind of the carrot in

248
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,140
the stick you can either uh you know you

249
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,940
you can either use this to stay relevant

250
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,880
and to uh to you know firmly uh entrench

251
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,440
yourself in the decision-making process

252
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,500
or you can get marginalized right and so

253
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,600
uh so this is something this is I think

254
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,920
this is good this is really starting to

255
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,000
resonate I think with a lot of

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,880
organizations right is understanding

257
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,980
that the risk to the digital aspects of

258
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,839
what they're trying to doing uh you'll

259
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,000
represent very real business risk and as

260
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,140
luck would have it they already have a

261
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,660
department whose job it is to help with

262
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,640
that

263
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,459
so just as organizations have

264
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,019
traditionally had Supply chains for

265
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,279
physical Goods right if you're a

266
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,420
manufacturer we need to get raw

267
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,160
materials we process those we you know

268
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,360
make some things and we hand them off to

269
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,459
Distributors Distributors then uh you

270
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,140
know sell them on down the line and

271
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,700
whatnot and so just as organizations

272
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,160
have had uh Supply chains for their

273
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,620
physical Goods uh organizations that are

274
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,899
both developing software and deploying

275
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,720
software also have software Supply

276
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,300
chains right because your software is

277
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,040
coming from somewhere if you're a

278
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,360
software buyer you're buying software

279
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,640
from different vendors and if you're

280
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,080
upstreaming that if you're a software

281
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,300
vendor like you're building software and

282
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,160
a big chunk of that software is probably

283
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,899
open source code that you did not write

284
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,279
right the applications and services

285
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,200
you're providing you wrote some of that

286
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,720
code other people that you don't know a

287
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,060
lot about probably wrote A lot of that

288
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,459
uh a lot of that code

289
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,980
and there's certainly Lessons Learned in

290
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,420
both directions

291
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,920
um but but these are really kind of very

292
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,260
different things right and so you know

293
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,480
looking at physical Supply chains you

294
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,700
see excellence in Supply chains uh

295
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,380
rewards organizations like that's a Tim

296
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,480
Cook uh at Apple that was kind of the

297
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,220
part of the business that he came out of

298
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,899
was you know understanding their supply

299
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,100
chain and really making sure that that

300
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,660
ran efficiently and Apple has done very

301
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,820
well uh you see challenges that

302
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,079
organizations have with Supply Channel

303
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,220
you know that's a portion of the

304
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,420
problems that like Peloton is having

305
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,519
right now from a market standpoint is

306
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,899
that you know supply chain issues that

307
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,220
they've had right

308
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,100
and so with the supply and your physical

309
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,680
Supply uh or physical Supply chains you

310
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,300
see you've got your your kind of demand

311
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,040
curve of you know we have certain Goods

312
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,540
we need to make sure that we have a

313
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,040
supply of them if the supply chain gets

314
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,240
messed up and demand stays the same

315
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,100
prices increase and things like that but

316
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,079
with software we're really looking at

317
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,060
this a little bit differently right with

318
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,160
software there's not a scarcity of

319
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,260
access to open source components right

320
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,940
like Maven Central is going to let me

321
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,600
download the Apache uh you know you know

322
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,180
log4j or like a Apache uh you know HTTP

323
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,920
Commons Library I can download that

324
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,540
pretty much as many times as I want

325
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,660
right and so scarcity isn't really the

326
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,000
concern in software Supply chains but

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,279
the integrity and the quality of the

328
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,959
components that you are bringing in

329
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,740
right and the the presence of security

330
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,420
uh you know flaws or security weaknesses

331
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,279
in that software either you know

332
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,100
inadvertently uh inserted into that into

333
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,440
that process or intentionally inserted

334
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,180
in that process like that's really the

335
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,380
concerns that we have with software

336
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,180
Supply chains right it's not that we're

337
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,399
going to run out of software uh it's uh

338
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,560
you know it's it's a

339
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,899
uh you know it's the quality and the

340
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,100
characteristics of the software that we

341
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,480
have right like I'm not concerned about

342
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,860
the boat from India with all the

343
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,600
software syncing right and they'd be

344
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
like oh no we've got to get another boat

345
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,140
full of software like okay can we get a

346
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,720
boat of Chinese software and use that

347
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,220
for this next run no like the the

348
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,860
concerns are are different right and uh

349
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,060
and that's something to understand

350
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,500
because I've seen some like kind of

351
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,779
goofy comparisons and whatnot I did have

352
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,820
the opportunity to do a joint webinar

353
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,920
with uh with uh

354
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,540
Grant John who is the um his exact title

355
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,160
he's the vice president of the

356
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,680
resilience Labs at interos enteros does

357
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,540
they have software but it does more

358
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,060
broad supply chain resilience uh and so

359
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,160
we did a joint webinar kind of riffing

360
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,019
on like here's some of the things that

361
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,339
organizations are concerned about with

362
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,720
software supply chain security and

363
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,279
here's you know maybe some lessons that

364
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,959
are learned from uh you know more

365
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,880
traditional supply chain resilience uh

366
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,019
you know here's what applies and here's

367
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,160
what is you know where there aren't

368
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,079
analogs and so that's an external

369
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,240
resource um that uh that you may want to

370
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,920
check out if you want to you know kind

371
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,300
of think or dig into that a little bit

372
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,620
more

373
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,440
so what is software supply chain

374
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,060
security so if you're Upstream if you're

375
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,579
a software vendor the biggest concerns

376
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,920
of this really center around what

377
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,420
components typically open source

378
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,139
components are you using right and you

379
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,760
know for you know for a given build of

380
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,220
your software what are the versions of

381
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,779
the components of the various components

382
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,519
that you're using and are there known

383
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,500
vulnerabilities in those components

384
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,519
right

385
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,519
and also looking at what tooling you're

386
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,500
using to build your software

387
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,360
um and I've got a the next slide here is

388
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,880
a link to some uh a talk I gave at RSA

389
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,500
looking at but looking at what is the

390
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,180
tooling and how do I trust the tooling

391
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,579
uh and what is the tooling going to what

392
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,740
impact is the tooling going to have on

393
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,600
the characteristics of the software that

394
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,519
I'm building and what are the security

395
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,200
characteristics right

396
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,720
you know if I am Downstream if I'm a

397
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,339
buyer of software and again

398
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,200
organizations can you know have both of

399
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,459
these roles in different parts of the

400
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,320
business but if you're if you're buying

401
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,120
software it's a question of you know who

402
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,339
are your various software vendors right

403
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,139
you know looking at that question of

404
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,000
attack surface management what is our

405
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,320
software attack service right if you're

406
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,760
building software internally that's some

407
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
attack surface if you're buying software

408
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,000
if you're licensing or subscribing to

409
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,339
cloud services that also represents a

410
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,560
tax service that you have and so as a

411
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,600
buyer of software your question for your

412
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,740
vendors are hey what are the

413
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,380
characteristics of the software that

414
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,360
we're buying from you right uh you know

415
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,519
four specific builds but also depending

416
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,260
on how comprehensive you're looking at

417
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,000
the problem also what are the practices

418
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,040
that our vendors have in place what

419
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,320
reason do we have to believe that the

420
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,760
software they're developing is going to

421
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,980
have an acceptable acceptable

422
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,540
characteristics

423
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,980
uh we'll talk a little bit later about

424
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,320
software Bill software Bill materials or

425
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,339
software bills and materials has

426
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,139
everybody heard software build materials

427
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,320
good those s-bomb vendors have been

428
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,880
successful in their in their Endeavors

429
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
so I like to say the desk bombs are

430
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,940
literally the least that we can do as an

431
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,959
industry

432
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,160
um but we'll talk it we'll talk a little

433
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,839
bit more about that uh in a couple

434
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,699
minutes

435
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,639
um so for a for a little more in-depth

436
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,500
look of the mechanics especially on the

437
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,240
software vendor side of software Builder

438
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,279
side I gave a talk at RSA this year

439
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,240
looking at a CI CD Pipeline and where in

440
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,339
the CI CD pipeline are there concerns

441
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,620
about software supply chain security

442
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,180
being introduced

443
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,459
um and it's a you know it's a management

444
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,980
level talk about a kind of more of a

445
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,139
technical level construct of CI CD

446
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,339
pipelines

447
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,620
um but that may be interesting uh that

448
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,060
may be interesting to folks if you're

449
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,279
curious about you know kind of what is

450
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,079
your overall attack surface look like as

451
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,519
you're building software from a supply

452
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,680
chain standpoint and I think what you'll

453
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,260
see is like just looking into the CI CD

454
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,240
pipelines there's it's a fractal attack

455
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,920
surface right like the closer that you

456
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,959
look at any part of a pipeline and its

457
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
attack surface what you find is there's

458
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,680
actually it's actually like even more

459
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,079
complicated or you know even harder to

460
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,180
kind of get your mind wrapped around in

461
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,040
a real structured way

462
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,680
um which is uh which is kind of scary

463
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,100
so you know why is as I talked about you

464
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,839
know I mean I remember the oauth's top

465
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,940
10 I want to say 2013 was the first year

466
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,279
where they included as a top uh

467
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,079
application risk the inclusion of

468
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,300
components with known vulnerabilities uh

469
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,740
yeah I remember arguing back and forth

470
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,420
with Josh Corman about like ah yeah it's

471
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,760
not really that important I was wrong uh

472
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,260
right so this is something that uh you

473
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,339
know that folks in the industry like

474
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,440
Josh Corman and others uh you know have

475
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,699
been looking at for a number of years

476
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,260
but it's really just something that has

477
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,139
come into more widespread attention

478
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,360
recently so why is this on the one side

479
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,680
there have been some really notable

480
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,860
breaches uh and incidents around this uh

481
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,680
you know as an aside like isn't it I I

482
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
love now that every vulnerability has to

483
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,579
have a logo yeah that's a that's the

484
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,040
other part of the process it it actually

485
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,360
one of my uh one of my colleagues uh uh

486
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,759
Ali miradari I always mispronounce his

487
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,019
last name and I apologize for that but

488
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,759
he was one of the people that worked on

489
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,500
the web cash deception vulnerability

490
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,240
which was one of the port swiger the

491
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,940
2019 port swiger best web hacking

492
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,179
techniques and and a dinner group we had

493
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,619
a you know some kind of holiday

494
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,240
traditions and one of those was a secret

495
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,099
Santa where you get a you know you you

496
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,079
get someone you have to buy them a gift

497
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,760
that is uh you know hopefully something

498
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,439
that meets their interests and whatnot

499
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,859
and so uh I went to uh you know uh you

500
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,480
know fiverr.com or something like that I

501
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,059
got him a logo uh I got him a logo for

502
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,980
webcast deception because uh you know

503
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,720
the people that you worked with had not

504
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,220
gone through the trouble hopefully he

505
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,500
really appreciated it

506
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,820
um but when we look at so let's look at

507
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,320
a couple of these different uh supply

508
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,600
chain concerns and I think and there's

509
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,460
obviously many more you know incidents

510
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,100
and vulnerabilities but this I think

511
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,299
starts to show a little bit of the

512
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,620
flavor of like how many different

513
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,480
directions these supply chain issues can

514
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,520
come from so Heartbleed was a

515
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,440
vulnerability open SSL library and it

516
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,059
leaked sensitive information this was

517
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,799
like maybe the first time that

518
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,600
organizations were like oh crap like how

519
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,059
do I find every app in our organization

520
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,400
where we're using open SSL right but

521
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,080
this is again a vulnerability it was

522
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,059
unintentionally introduced as far as we

523
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,520
know uh in that openssl library that

524
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,320
then gets included in freaking

525
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,700
everything right

526
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,380
uh fast forward a little bit we've got

527
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,780
the solar winds breach right that was a

528
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,419
malicious breach of the solar winds and

529
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,520
their software sits on top of a lot of

530
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,500
really valuable data right because

531
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,520
they're doing your network management

532
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,260
and things like that but that was a

533
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,620
breach of the solar winds folks in an

534
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,140
attempt to attack the users of their

535
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,059
software right and so that's a little

536
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,620
bit different that's not an accidental

537
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,720
bug in a library that got included right

538
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,340
that was a breach of a vendor with the

539
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,220
intention of leveraging that breach to

540
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,400
have access to the downstream uh you

541
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,200
know the downstream folks that uh that

542
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,419
were using that software right so you

543
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,740
know a very different kind of attack

544
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,179
pattern

545
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,440
um you know then we look at log for

546
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,000
shell and spring for shell

547
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,860
boy were those fun

548
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,080
um you know where everybody then had to

549
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,760
go back and say like oh hey you know

550
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,020
where are all of our Java applications

551
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,020
and which of them are using log4j uh

552
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,220
which of them are using spring and

553
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,600
especially in the case of Vlog for Jay

554
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,340
the answer was well we have more Java

555
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,480
applications and we you'd probably

556
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,539
believe uh and everything uses log for

557
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,059
uh everything uses log for shell and and

558
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,919
the lucky P or the log for J rather and

559
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,120
the lucky ones were the ones that were

560
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,360
using log4j 1.0 that was so old that it

561
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,580
wasn't vulnerable to this so uh yeah

562
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,980
shout out to everybody who is like that

563
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,140
bad you know kind of the Horseshoe the

564
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,760
Horseshoe bends back around where your

565
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,440
your security practices are so bad that

566
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,320
you managed to avoid being vulnerable to

567
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,720
this particular incident your uh your uh

568
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,840
your laziness has paid off

569
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,179
right uh and then we saw the code Cub

570
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,400
reach so again they were a supplier of

571
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,780
software tooling looking at code

572
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,760
coverage they were breached

573
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,559
and then that had an impact down the

574
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,360
line to people who are using that tool

575
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,679
in their in their build pipelines

576
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,400
there's part of their build

577
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,900
infrastructure right so these are a

578
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,220
couple of high profile they're that's

579
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,960
not an exhaustive list but that's a

580
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,780
couple of high profile uh examples of

581
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,000
supply chain concerns and what is

582
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,980
maddening about them is it's not one

583
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,080
thing right you can't just say well okay

584
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,580
well if we if everybody was doing

585
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,260
software composition analysis properly

586
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,640
we would have solved this issue right

587
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,559
because you know that's would have

588
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,820
addressed some of the concerns but

589
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,160
didn't address other other concerns and

590
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,600
we don't I don't have any examples here

591
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,940
of situations where weaknesses or

592
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,380
vulnerabilities had been intentionally

593
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,179
introduced into open source libraries to

594
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,620
do crypto mining or something like that

595
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,380
right and so these breaches have

596
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,240
certainly brought this to the to the

597
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,460
industry's attention there's also the

598
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,260
Biden Administration executive order of

599
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,660
2021 looking at the you know cyber

600
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,460
security and you know improving the

601
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,340
nation's cyber security and a a pretty

602
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,860
big part of this was looking at supply

603
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,660
chain security right and saying hey

604
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,360
we've got this software uh we've got

605
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,740
software software's critical to all

606
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,299
these government services

607
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,220
and we're not doing enough to look at

608
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,840
this software supply chain security and

609
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,760
that was where some of the initial uh

610
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,620
you know kind of uh or not not initial

611
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,840
but you know kind of more public uh

612
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,400
questions about uh

613
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,780
you know software bill of materials and

614
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,860
things like that and so this has been

615
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,480
followed up by Publications from nist

616
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,360
and OMB uh and is looking at like how is

617
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,860
the U.S federal government going to

618
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,720
shift their purchasing requirements and

619
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,940
their purchasing Behavior because they

620
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,679
essentially have they can act from the

621
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,900
bully pulpit to say well you know a lot

622
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,280
a lot of a whole lot of organizations

623
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
make a whole lot of money selling to the

624
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,860
federal government and if you've got to

625
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,080
change your practices and change the way

626
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,000
you communicate about your software for

627
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,140
the federal government you know that

628
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,059
then you know kind of de facto is

629
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,980
potentially spread out to uh you know to

630
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,720
private sector organization purchasing

631
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,080
as well

632
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,640
um so you know you know because of these

633
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,720
forces this is something that I've been

634
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
looking into uh you know for for a year

635
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,340
or two now uh just is interesting to see

636
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,600
how this evolves in some of the market

637
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,520
dynamics and so uh one of the things we

638
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,500
did at Coal Fire is we said like hey

639
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,900
let's see what you know how are

640
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,400
organizations respond to this not just

641
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,620
in security teams but kind of across the

642
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,000
you know kind of management layers of

643
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,460
organizations both on the supply side

644
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,740
and on the buy side

645
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,039
um and and so what we did is we we went

646
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,299
out and surveyed a bunch of folks it's

647
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,159
funny uh you know doing research

648
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,320
research we did a bunch of uh I did a

649
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,700
couple of interesting research projects

650
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,500
at denim group where we had you know

651
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,059
comparatively less resources and it

652
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,440
always like I would disappear for two

653
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,020
weeks and like dig through uh you know

654
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,820
pen test reports or time tracking system

655
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,200
all these different data sources that we

656
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,340
had and you know we're looking at you

657
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,020
know and doing statistics on that and

658
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,100
like the output of that would be like

659
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,080
six of cell spreadsheets uh you know

660
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,179
like 800 lines of really crappy python

661
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,980
code and for some reason a Microsoft

662
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,539
access database

663
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:31,620
um you know and we would use that to

664
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,419
write reports and I was talk about this

665
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,620
with the folks at Coal Fire and they're

666
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,720
like oh yeah we've got this real

667
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,340
research and analyst firm we can just uh

668
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,840
like we just make the survey that we

669
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,799
wanted to send out we give them the

670
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,059
demographics of the people that we want

671
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,159
them to survey uh you know that you know

672
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,419
they work with us to make sure are you

673
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:46,559
actually going to get the response are

674
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,179
these questions formulated so that you

675
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,380
get the types of responses you're

676
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,880
looking for and then like two weeks

677
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,340
later I get a you know a a PowerPoint

678
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,380
deck and access to an online thing where

679
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,120
I can slice and dice the data I much

680
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,220
prefer uh you know for a variety of

681
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,659
reasons I much prefer the way that we uh

682
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,820
that we did this research

683
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,500
um and so that the report uh you can

684
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,600
download uh you know off the web we've

685
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,700
got linked uh linked to that um and what

686
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,260
I'm essentially going to talk about here

687
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,880
is you know some of the highlights that

688
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,820
at least I saw uh from that report

689
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,140
uh so looking at the research

690
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,620
methodology so these are looking here

691
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,679
these are we talked to 150 folks in

692
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,780
software buyers and 150 folks and

693
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,600
software suppliers and on the software

694
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,880
buyer profile is spread across different

695
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,820
company sizes which which is nice there

696
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,559
was a little bit of a concentration in

697
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,880
high tech I would have loved to have

698
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,620
seen more in banking and Investment

699
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,539
Services

700
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,820
um and it's spread across the different

701
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,440
levels in the organization you know kind

702
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,120
of concentrated the manager or director

703
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,640
level but also looking at the VP you

704
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,260
know we got responses from VP and

705
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,600
c-level folks as well right and so uh

706
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,539
yeah so again a kind of a good spread of

707
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,340
different perspectives on this

708
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,740
uh similar on the vendor side the

709
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,419
company size skewed a little bit smaller

710
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,679
you know that makes sense if you're a

711
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,299
software vendor as opposed to somebody

712
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,679
moving physical Goods hopefully you get

713
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,240
some leverage uh you don't have to have

714
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
as many people to do your whatever

715
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,179
business stuff you're doing so the

716
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,039
company size skewed a bit smaller uh

717
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,659
still concentrated in high tech and it

718
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,220
because again if you're selling software

719
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,500
you probably view yourself uh more

720
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,940
frequently as being in high tech or it

721
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,340
versus other Industries uh good we're at

722
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,500
the level and uh and a good thing here

723
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,179
is like three quarter the respondents

724
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,220
were directly involved in the

725
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,080
application security efforts right so

726
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,940
they had the knowledge of what is going

727
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,320
on in the organization you know they

728
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,360
were at a vantage point to know it's

729
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,520
from a software vendor side what are we

730
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,539
doing

731
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,539
um and how are things changing

732
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,360
so key findings who drives software

733
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,340
supply chain initiatives so on the

734
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,780
software buyer side and this is

735
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,100
something that I think is really really

736
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,620
interesting what you see is that in

737
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,179
sixty percent of the organizations the

738
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,740
security team was helping to drive these

739
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,659
initiatives that's great like we would

740
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,820
expect that to be the most common group

741
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,580
right I have some questions for the 40

742
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,440
of organizations where they are not

743
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,900
driving where they're not involved in

744
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,460
driving these initiatives so I I do have

745
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,539
some questions but you would expect

746
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,700
security to be up there

747
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,039
what's really interesting though is the

748
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,799
second group down at participating in 51

749
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,620
of the organization surveyed was people

750
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,780
at the sea level right so not VPS not

751
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,299
managers at the sea level like that's

752
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,059
really important because it's at the C

753
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,580
Level where organization strategies and

754
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,919
priorities are determined right and

755
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,559
where budget gets allocated right and

756
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,900
those are really critical things I mean

757
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,580
there's only so much that you can do

758
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,880
with ground up efforts right it's the

759
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,559
c-level folks that have to make things

760
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,419
happen that was one of the findings that

761
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,820
uh that was one of the findings that I

762
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,279
uh I remember from I think it was the

763
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,740
first BCM report is one of the critical

764
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,840
success factors for software Security

765
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,779
Programs was they had to have like a an

766
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,940
actual like named leader of the program

767
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,940
right ground you know

768
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,799
Grassroots stuff is a great way to start

769
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,200
but if you want a sustained program if

770
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,059
you want to scale a program if you

771
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,679
wanted to live over time it has to have

772
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,360
leadership and it has has to have

773
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,520
approval and budget right and so seeing

774
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,159
the sea levels that were uh you know sea

775
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,480
levels being involved at this on the

776
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,159
vendor side you know that gives me hope

777
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,820
that uh you know that that we'll start

778
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,380
to see they're the folks that have the

779
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,360
ability to you know to allocate

780
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,679
resources and to make sure this is

781
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,120
something that gets sustained and can be

782
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,700
scaled uh as another aside my colleague

783
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,059
John Dixon did a uh report uh you know

784
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,380
surveyed a bunch of organizations on

785
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,240
appsec Champions and that was one of the

786
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,980
that was one of the key challenges that

787
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,799
he found in appsec uh Champions uh is

788
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,900
there is so much turnover in leadership

789
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,059
of app Security Programs it caused a lot

790
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,620
of these uh you know it caused a lot of

791
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,299
these apps that champion programs to get

792
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,520
reset and never really be able to get

793
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,320
the tractions they wanted so if appsec

794
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,220
Champions is something that you're

795
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,620
interested in again that reports uh up

796
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,340
online as well

797
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,779
okay

798
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:01,679
um so

799
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,539
when we uh

800
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,100
we flip this around to the vendor so

801
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,600
that's on the buyer's side right really

802
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,679
interesting thing that came out of that

803
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,140
sea level folks are thinking about this

804
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,520
talking about this participating in

805
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,799
these efforts on the vendor side and

806
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,779
this was maybe the most surprising maybe

807
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:19,559
maybe not but the most common group

808
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,720
participating in the software supply

809
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
chain decision or software supply chain

810
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,340
security decision making wasn't the

811
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,960
security group right it was the devops

812
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
group with 71 and 71 of those

813
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,460
organizations it was the devops group

814
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,220
that was represented you know not the

815
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,480
soul group obviously you know if you

816
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,740
total these up this goes to more than

817
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,419
100 but in 71 percent of these

818
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,919
organizations it was the devops

819
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,360
organization driving this and I thought

820
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,460
that was really interesting because it

821
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,320
outstripped the 63 of those

822
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,120
organizations where security was in

823
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,580
there and and you know participating in

824
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,020
these software supply chain security

825
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,480
discussions right so again I have I have

826
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,360
questions for 37 of the organizations uh

827
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,100
where security uh where security teams

828
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,720
aren't involved and I'm really really

829
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,240
excited to see that 71 percent of these

830
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,940
uh organizations where the devops team

831
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,380
was participating in this and that's

832
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,419
really interesting on the vendor on the

833
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,460
vendor side because they're the folks

834
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,720
that actually have to do the work that's

835
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,179
been a both one of the most interesting

836
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,100
things about being in the application

837
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,539
security space for a long time as well

838
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:21,000
as the most frustrating things is that

839
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,039
you know in in appsec or Security in

840
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,600
general I think I saw yesterday uh yeah

841
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
it's really more like a project managing

842
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,320
resources that you don't control right

843
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
like that's been a challenge of the

844
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,320
application Securities the app security

845
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,179
groups you know reporting up through the

846
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,400
sizzle they understand the risk and

847
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,380
attempt to characterize the risk but at

848
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,539
the end of the day they need development

849
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,340
teams to change their behaviors and so

850
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,380
seeing that devops groups be so involved

851
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,840
or so prominent uh in their involvement

852
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,220
in the software supply chain security

853
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,380
efforts that kind of gives me like a

854
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,299
warm fuzzy feeling right because those

855
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,740
are the folks that are going to have to

856
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,659
allocate to time and resources to

857
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,360
addressing these types of concerns right

858
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,159
so that's a that's something that was

859
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:00,720
really exciting to come out of this to

860
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,419
see because again just like on you know

861
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,880
on on the buyer's side if the sea level

862
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,860
say we need to allocate resources like

863
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,620
that's required uh but we we're also

864
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,820
needing to see the participation on the

865
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,260
vendor side of the folks that are

866
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,460
actually going to have to go in and like

867
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,679
change their practices change you know

868
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,659
how open source components are are used

869
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,820
and updated

870
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,059
so let's look at how how does software

871
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,340
supply chain security concerns impact

872
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,399
purchases right

873
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,799
and so in a in a world of digital

874
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,080
transformation to laser bad right we

875
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
talked earlier this this drive we need

876
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,320
to innovate faster we need iterate

877
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,000
faster right everybody wants to be the

878
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,399
first with the most right and time to

879
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,100
Market is key right so

880
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,740
a concern that I would have as a

881
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,840
software buyer is are my projects being

882
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,240
held up by these software supply chain

883
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,340
security concerns right am I am I unable

884
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,020
to procure the software and the

885
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,760
software-based services that I need in

886
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,679
order to implement the initiatives that

887
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,080
we have because those delays represent

888
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,080
uh you know a you know a risk to the

889
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,460
organization from an innovation

890
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,659
standpoint that they're not going to be

891
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,640
able to keep pace and what we see is

892
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,320
some impact this is not overwhelming

893
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,299
what we do see is you know 23 of the

894
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,340
organizations have a a one to three

895
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,039
month uh delay in procurement that

896
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,899
they've seen based on supply chain

897
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,460
concerns and that even goes up even more

898
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,779
concerned you know nine percent of the

899
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,279
organization saying we've seen delays of

900
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,600
up to three to six months you know three

901
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,000
percent saying six months or more right

902
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,559
you know it's one thing to look at

903
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,299
saying like hey this is going to be a

904
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,100
couple weeks late that's you know I've

905
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,320
uh you know I've I've heard that from

906
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,460
people I've worked with I've had to tell

907
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,779
that to a lot of folks like a couple

908
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,399
weeks is is one thing but we start to

909
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,200
look at delays in the months right then

910
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,940
we start to see things tick over quarter

911
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,159
boundaries right uh you know and as you

912
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,480
start to see things tick over quarter

913
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,440
boundaries then you're like

914
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,600
strategically starts to uh you know get

915
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,159
a little more brittle or potentially

916
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,880
face an impact

917
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,260
on the flip side of the coin on the

918
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,659
vendor side you know purchase delays

919
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,159
mean very directly that your

920
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,740
organization isn't getting money

921
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,779
most organizations that I've worked with

922
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,700
like to get money

923
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,440
right

924
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,000
or at least the ones that the ones that

925
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,860
remain as going concerns like to get

926
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,380
money right

927
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,179
and you know and and this is kind of an

928
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,940
expansion of a broader you know thing

929
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,460
that I've seen in application security

930
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,159
is that you know when it starts to

931
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,140
impact purchasing you know all of a

932
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,700
sudden organizations start to get really

933
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,799
excited about application security right

934
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,020
so all the good hygiene discussions that

935
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,700
we've had over the you know nearly 20

936
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,100
years that OAS has been around right

937
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,720
like hey you should really be you should

938
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,919
be doing this and it's nice you don't

939
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,120
want to be vulnerable and everybody says

940
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,620
like yeah all things being equal I would

941
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,059
love to have more secure software but

942
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,100
I've got other concerns well all of a

943
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,960
sudden when purchases start getting held

944
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,100
up

945
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,740
like oh okay right so if you change the

946
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,179
incentives then you start to change the

947
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,120
behaviors and so like seeing money or a

948
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,399
delay of money or a a withdrawal of

949
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,840
money being introduced into the process

950
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,140
uh that has been the most effective uh

951
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,880
agent for change that I've seen to get

952
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,260
organizations start to really care about

953
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,399
application Level security

954
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,960
um I think back there was a uh we had a

955
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,299
an expansion opportunity for uh For

956
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,760
Thread fix uh that was being held up and

957
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,440
uh yeah they'd said hey we want to do

958
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,600
this expansion but we've got a

959
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,520
um we've got a new vendor onboarding

960
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,720
process and you've got to go like

961
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,919
through the new vendor onboarding

962
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,419
process before we can before we can go

963
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:25,740
through with this expansion right they

964
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,299
they sent the documents to go through

965
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:28,860
that process and they kind of bounced

966
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,120
around the product team for a while

967
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,679
right like nobody was really kind of

968
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,000
digging their teeth in nobody stepped up

969
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,940
to to handle this and and the sales uh

970
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,080
you know person on the account was

971
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,760
saying like hey hey gang like I've I'm

972
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,020
trying to make my numbers we got money

973
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,779
out here let's let's go get it and so I

974
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,539
because I'm an idiot

975
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:46,559
volunteered I said hey I can probably

976
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,240
I'll bird dog this I can probably answer

977
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,500
a lot of the questions run down the

978
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,240
stuff that I uh you know that that I

979
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,039
don't uh yeah that I don't know uh you

980
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,000
know I've got a little free time I'm

981
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,200
more than happy to help I'm a team

982
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,059
player this is the last time I do

983
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,340
anything nice for anyone ever right so

984
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,980
if you need a favor like do not do not

985
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,440
contact me because this was like two

986
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,539
spreadsheets eight tabs you know several

987
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,640
hundred questions that those very

988
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,620
in-depth looking at like okay hey you

989
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,820
know what kind of testing are you doing

990
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,960
like what kind of encryption you're

991
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,340
using how do you rotate Keys you know

992
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,779
how do you threat like very very

993
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,760
invasive in-depth stuff and it took me

994
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,120
forever to answer right you know but

995
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,279
again what we saw is that you know the

996
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,539
sales team starts jumping up and down

997
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,039
and complaining to people up and down uh

998
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,840
you know up and down the chain and and I

999
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,159
you know being an idiot in this case but

1000
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,679
volunteered to help but what we see is

1001
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,500
like as vendors change their onboarding

1002
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,720
requirements that changes Behavior or it

1003
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,000
forces action or sorry as buyers change

1004
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,919
their uh their requirements for

1005
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,799
purchasing vendors will respond to these

1006
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,019
uh in order to uh you know in in order

1007
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,179
to uh you know in order to keep money

1008
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:51,320
flowing through the organization

1009
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,059
so the next thing that we looked at is

1010
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,039
how our software supply chain concerns

1011
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,880
going to impact budget and so uh

1012
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,220
interestingly here is anybody here a fan

1013
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,679
of the West Wing the TV show

1014
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,380
you know fun fun show and uh there's a

1015
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,359
quote from uh Josh Lyman somewhere one

1016
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,619
of the earlier Seasons I think it says

1017
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,540
there are only two reasons that ever

1018
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,800
stop government from doing anything

1019
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,639
money in politics right and yeah you

1020
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,199
know and so again looking at looking at

1021
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,699
organizations

1022
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,560
you know budget is the corporate love

1023
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,839
language right like that is what that is

1024
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,719
how organizations say this is what I

1025
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,219
want to do this is what I want to see

1026
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,599
more of this is what I want to see less

1027
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,480
of right and so looking at how budgets

1028
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,619
are going to change or how organizations

1029
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,000
think they're going to be changed budget

1030
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
from this is is really interesting and

1031
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,239
so like over a third of organizations

1032
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,119
are planning to dedicate 10 or more of

1033
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,399
their appsec budgets to software supply

1034
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,320
chain security concerns

1035
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,719
right like that's that's not non-trivial

1036
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,980
you know depending depending on the

1037
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,619
organization right and so what are you

1038
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,540
know what are the what are the uh

1039
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,800
uh what are the buyers going to be doing

1040
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,560
with additional budget right uh you know

1041
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,359
you know 59 of the organization says

1042
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,680
they're going to increase the amount of

1043
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,380
testing that they're doing on uh on uh

1044
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,480
third-party software uh 50 of the

1045
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,560
organization says they're going to be

1046
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,480
purchasing some systems or tooling to

1047
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,339
help them manage these concerns and then

1048
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:14,400
it drops off to uh 34 you know retaining

1049
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,780
experts you know hiring staff and things

1050
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,400
like that right so but what the buyers

1051
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,540
say they're going to do is they hey

1052
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,859
we're going to increase the inspection

1053
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,440
or the testing on uh the applications

1054
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,640
that we're purchasing and we're going to

1055
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,200
get some infrastructure in place to help

1056
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
manage this process

1057
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,020
um I'll talk a little bit later about

1058
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,339
how I think that's that's going to be

1059
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:30,839
really challenging

1060
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:31,859
um you know if you're if you're looking

1061
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,900
at like every buyer you know for all of

1062
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,640
their vendors like uh you know how

1063
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,320
quickly does your number of like

1064
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,940
third-party pen tests like just

1065
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,280
geometrically uh spiral out of control I

1066
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,180
think there's some things that we can do

1067
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,500
with transparency but that's you know

1068
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,820
that's what these organizations say that

1069
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,020
they're going to be doing

1070
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,420
uh on the vendor side again a third of

1071
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,040
an organization saying 10 of their app

1072
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,660
SEC budget is going to be dedicated to

1073
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,280
software supply chain security concerns

1074
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
right and when we look at the things

1075
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,640
that the vendors say they're going to be

1076
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,680
doing uh 65 say they're going to be

1077
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,420
adding new tooling that's great news for

1078
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,480
the Expo uh expo hall out there shout

1079
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,040
out to the expo hall

1080
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,599
um you know 61 say they're going to

1081
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,760
increase governance 57 say they're going

1082
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,680
to be embedding security Personnel into

1083
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,960
devops and so uh once again uh you know

1084
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,520
looking at those appsec Champions type

1085
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,440
programs uh you know feel free to check

1086
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,300
out John Dixon's report uh where he

1087
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,920
looks into how organizations are are

1088
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,880
actually doing that

1089
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,640
um so what we see on the vendor side you

1090
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,839
know why are they changing their

1091
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,940
behaviors and a majority of these

1092
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,359
vendors 57 uh 57 say they're allocating

1093
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,359
additional resources to the process and

1094
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,000
53 saying they're looking at the s-bomb

1095
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,640
requirement uh you know as uh you know

1096
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,040
based on the Biden uh based on the

1097
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,560
bidenio right and so what we're seeing

1098
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,040
is again organizations are or to look at

1099
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,400
this we're seeing is that teams outside

1100
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,339
of security are taking an interest in

1101
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,560
software supply chain security right and

1102
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,480
I think that's really good I I would

1103
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,460
expect security to be leading the charge

1104
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,680
in these organizations it's kind of

1105
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,320
their job right so uh so again I've got

1106
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,200
some I've got some some rather uh

1107
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,880
appointed questions for uh for

1108
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,680
organizations where their security teams

1109
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,300
are not concerned or not involved in

1110
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,500
these software supply chain security

1111
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,020
initiatives right but we can't like as

1112
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,820
Security Professionals we can't do that

1113
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,339
on our own right we don't control the

1114
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,140
budgeting and the priority and the

1115
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,700
strategy at the highest level of the

1116
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,619
organization to say we're going to do

1117
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,240
this or not do this right like that's

1118
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,160
you know for for that we need the you

1119
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,560
know the c-level folks to agree that

1120
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,320
this is a priority right from a Hands-On

1121
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,260
keyboard standpoint right we can't

1122
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,700
uh you know from from the security

1123
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,320
advantage point like we can't go in and

1124
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,660
mandate uh right or we can't go in and

1125
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,640
change the code and uh you know and and

1126
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,859
and make the development teams do this

1127
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,359
stuff right so that's really exciting to

1128
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,420
me to see teams outside of security uh

1129
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,220
that are uh that are getting involved in

1130
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,260
this right and again uh you know strong

1131
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,760
opinions weekly held more broadly

1132
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,339
speaking you know and as we look at this

1133
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,619
world of digital transformation where I

1134
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:05,880
think security teams need to be

1135
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,040
rebranding themselves as risk advisors

1136
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,780
like all right how can we make sure that

1137
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,240
as we go faster right as we you know

1138
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,680
integrate more closely with different

1139
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,960
types of stakeholders how do we how do

1140
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,940
we make sure that we're doing that in a

1141
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,680
resilient and in a secure manner how do

1142
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,300
we do this as securely as possible right

1143
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,060
so now it's good to see other parts of

1144
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,280
these organizations that are caring

1145
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,220
about security uh because really I mean

1146
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,900
again to a certain degree of security is

1147
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,099
everyone's job and it's a security

1148
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,079
team's responsibility to make sure that

1149
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,700
everyone else has the tools to do this

1150
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,220
so uh you know that's uh that's I think

1151
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,980
an exciting uh exciting Trend to see

1152
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,720
uh the next thing we're seeing is that

1153
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,640
software supply chain concerns are

1154
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,440
causing delays in software procurement

1155
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,660
all right on the buyer side is this

1156
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,220
putting your initiatives at risk right

1157
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,720
are your competitors going to be able to

1158
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,040
jam through what they're trying to do

1159
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,480
faster

1160
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,220
um you know because uh you know because

1161
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,780
that that's a real risk you know that's

1162
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,040
uh you know we've done I've done work

1163
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,420
with financial services organizations

1164
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,280
where they've said like Hey we're

1165
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,200
willing to ignore the risk of fraud

1166
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,060
right uh we're willing to ignore the

1167
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,260
risk of fraud for this particular

1168
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,520
initiative that we have we're going to

1169
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,079
mop that up later we want to make sure

1170
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,339
that we have this product to Market

1171
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,680
first right it's very important for us

1172
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,359
to be first and we're willing to accept

1173
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,119
risk and some monetary losses from us

1174
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,619
from a security and a fraud standpoint

1175
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,599
in order to get there first because we

1176
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,000
perceive that the value to our

1177
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,940
organization is much greater than the

1178
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,820
losses we expect to incur right and so

1179
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,040
when we see delays being introduced into

1180
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,560
the process for uh you know for for

1181
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,000
software buyers you know that's

1182
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,500
potentially putting these initiatives of

1183
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,780
theirs at risk even more directly

1184
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,820
impacted are the software vendors right

1185
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,619
if if the people buying from you are

1186
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,480
saying like hey you know I need you to

1187
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,920
you know first I need you to report on

1188
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,079
your processes right and more

1189
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,760
importantly I need you to be to have

1190
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,680
your processes and your practices in

1191
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,540
line with our expectations before we're

1192
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,800
willing to go through with a purchase

1193
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,160
like whoa okay like all of a sudden the

1194
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,960
app security team is really in the

1195
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,420
Limelight and it's a it's a question and

1196
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,619
of course the question will be phrased

1197
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:05,640
like why aren't you guys already doing

1198
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,720
this and the answer is because you

1199
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,339
wouldn't pay us because the sea levels

1200
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,839
wouldn't allocate budget and do all the

1201
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,980
other stuff that we needed to you know

1202
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,420
make this happen and to scale across the

1203
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,460
organization right so I'm not saying the

1204
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,720
questions are going to be fair that are

1205
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,460
going to be placed uh on on the app

1206
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,200
security teams right but these questions

1207
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,220
are going to come to the app security

1208
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,740
team saying all right our purchases are

1209
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,079
being held up or put at risk because we

1210
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,520
don't have certain practices in place

1211
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,680
you need to get these practices in place

1212
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,300
so that we can pass whatever you know

1213
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,619
whatever the bar that we're seeing for

1214
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,060
the purchasing organization is going to

1215
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,020
be

1216
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,000
uh and again finally we're going to see

1217
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,760
application security budgets shifting to

1218
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,440
put some focus on these supply chain

1219
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,960
issues and notice that the way that we

1220
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,640
phrase the question we you know Limited

1221
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,599
in the number of questions that we could

1222
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,579
have really the way that we asked the

1223
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,920
question looked at uh you know didn't

1224
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,300
say that there would be new budget

1225
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,740
allocated to this that's certainly

1226
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,480
possible but is not necessarily

1227
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,760
reflected in how we asked the question

1228
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,560
uh so I I would assume that budget may

1229
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,420
be shifting to this right but at the

1230
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,740
very least there will be more budget

1231
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,359
applied to these software supply chain

1232
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,619
security concerns you know whether

1233
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,320
that's new budget or reallocated budget

1234
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,180
um and uh yeah and from that again we're

1235
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,500
going to see you know third-party

1236
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,560
testing uh and uh you know purchasing

1237
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,420
systems to manage this process on the

1238
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,280
buyer side and we're going to see you

1239
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,780
know new new tooling and things on the

1240
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,240
supplier side

1241
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,160
so taking a step back and looking at

1242
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,240
this you know what what kind of comes

1243
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,579
next you know I think that uh you know

1244
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,560
this is a theme that we've seen across

1245
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,000
other drivers but I think we're going to

1246
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,380
see you know this inventory and attack

1247
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,140
surface management is uh you know is is

1248
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,060
really having a moment right with uh

1249
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,560
when everybody first had to find all

1250
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,839
their Java applications with log4j

1251
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,220
uh you know and then a couple weeks

1252
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,960
later it's like hey did we do we still

1253
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,339
have that Excel spreadsheet we made with

1254
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:45,839
all the Java applications for log4j

1255
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,040
because now we need to look at all the

1256
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,300
Java applications to see if they have

1257
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,980
spring all right hopefully we'll move

1258
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,960
from these ad hoc you know kind of

1259
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,119
knee-jerk hair on fire uh responses to

1260
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,800
these types of things and again more

1261
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,540
focus on what is our you know from

1262
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,280
vendor management standpoint from an

1263
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,260
attack surface management standpoint uh

1264
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,240
you know do we have uh you know do we

1265
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,700
have a uh you know comprehensive is

1266
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,980
probably uh aspirational but you know do

1267
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,420
we have at least some idea of where

1268
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,800
these applications exist in our

1269
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,940
organization

1270
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,900
uh software uh s-bombs uh or more you

1271
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,579
know pedantically uh software bills of

1272
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,280
material uh that acronyms not nearly as

1273
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,260
fun as s-bombs uh but s-bombs I think

1274
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,280
are going to be something that we see a

1275
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,480
lot more of that's something that we've

1276
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,240
seen uh from purchasers uh you know in

1277
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,800
the financial services space you know

1278
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,000
for a long time they've been asking

1279
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,560
saying hey send us a list uh you know

1280
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,180
send us a list of all the open source

1281
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,160
components you've got into versions I

1282
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,420
say what format do you want it in they

1283
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,640
say Excel which means that it's going in

1284
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,500
a like an S3 bucket or a SharePoint

1285
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,700
drive or something and no one's going to

1286
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,260
look at it you know hopefully we'll

1287
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,359
start to see organizations uh you know

1288
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,980
move from because an s-bomb by itself

1289
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,480
does nothing right if you say here's the

1290
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,160
open source components I have in the

1291
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,599
versions like that doesn't do anything

1292
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,280
until someone Compares that to a list of

1293
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,720
known vulnerabilities and says like oh

1294
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,920
hey a couple of these look really bad

1295
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,359
like we probably need to get those

1296
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,560
addressed right

1297
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,140
and so uh hopefully we'll also see again

1298
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,119
move to standards like Cyclone DX which

1299
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,280
is an OAS project really really uh

1300
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,900
really really cool standard for uh

1301
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,819
communicating software uh bill of

1302
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:12,180
material information uh and uh yeah and

1303
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,560
then the systems are out again another

1304
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,020
fantastic OAS like a flagship project is

1305
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,140
OAS dependency track uh both Cyclone DX

1306
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,960
and dependency track uh you know led by

1307
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,180
Steve springet uh and what depend but

1308
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,560
dependency tracklist you do is it lets

1309
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,540
you upload s-bombs for your portfolio of

1310
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,400
software and then compare that to uh you

1311
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,900
know the nvd downloads and stuff over

1312
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,160
time to see when new vulnerabilities

1313
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,099
crop up uh so if you're looking uh you

1314
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:36,839
know if you're looking to get started uh

1315
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,579
you know in the in the uh in

1316
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,560
anticipation of budget

1317
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,420
um or or just in general those are both

1318
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,700
great projects to look at

1319
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,900
um I think we're going to see a drive

1320
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,940
for further transparency and it's been

1321
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,400
frustrating to watch the you know kind

1322
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,859
of the work around the the EO from the

1323
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:54,300
Biden Administration and like what is

1324
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,420
the administration like how how how

1325
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,619
sharp are the teeth gonna be that come

1326
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,079
out of those recommendations right and

1327
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,400
and I'm afraid that we're going to see

1328
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,380
like I'm afraid that we're going to be

1329
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,180
see see s-bombs be kind of the high

1330
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,880
water mark of the requirements that come

1331
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,200
out of that

1332
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,200
um which uh which you know again is

1333
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,579
literally I believe the least we could

1334
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:15,599
do

1335
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,240
um I think that uh or I hope that we'll

1336
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,859
see for further transparency you know

1337
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:21,420
transparency and like what is the point

1338
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,000
in time security status of the software

1339
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,740
of this particular build of the software

1340
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,540
right I don't think we're going to see a

1341
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,160
world where uh where you're willing to

1342
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,020
share your last pen test report I mean

1343
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,160
we get requests for like hey can you

1344
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,020
send your last pen test report for this

1345
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,200
we're like no uh you know but but what

1346
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,200
we do uh or or what is a lot less

1347
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,660
objectionable to send is like hey here's

1348
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,579
the type of testing that was done this

1349
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,200
is the type of stuff that was found from

1350
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,359
a critical high medium and low or CVSs

1351
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:50,460
yeah this is what has been remediated

1352
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,619
and you know this has been confirmed a

1353
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,180
successful remediation right like those

1354
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,619
those types of things we've done things

1355
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,540
like that or helped uh like Financial

1356
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,180
Services organizations in the past use a

1357
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,619
publicly available standard like OAS

1358
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:04,619
asvs uh and to say like hey so they can

1359
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,660
say hey we've been tested according to

1360
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,020
this asvs standard uh we got the

1361
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,700
detailed Report with the code and the

1362
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,160
line numbers and the URLs right and uh

1363
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,839
but but here was kind of the character

1364
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,240
of the report from a severity and count

1365
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,520
standpoint here's the remediation that's

1366
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,260
been performed here's and and here's

1367
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,640
what remains right here and here's the

1368
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,900
schedule you know we killed all the

1369
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,060
criticals and the highs and the mediums

1370
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,339
or uh or are set to be you know handled

1371
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:30,420
within the next quarter or something

1372
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,040
like that right like that level of

1373
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,480
communication I think is something that

1374
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,160
organization uh that hopefully

1375
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,020
organizations be comfortable with

1376
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,700
um assuming of course that they are

1377
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,020
willing to remediate their criticals and

1378
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,079
highs uh in their software right but

1379
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,180
also also seeing some transparency

1380
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,859
around development practices again like

1381
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:50,040
I I would not wish on my worst enemy to

1382
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,500
have to go through those like a crazy

1383
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,940
spreadsheets you know for for the uh you

1384
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,680
know for this organization with you know

1385
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,119
hundreds and hundreds of questions you

1386
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,859
know it'd be much much better to say hey

1387
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,839
we do asbs right and what are your

1388
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:02,819
practices oh well here's our most recent

1389
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:04,980
oauth Sam assessment and here's the you

1390
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,300
know here's the maturity levels that we

1391
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,440
achieved in the practices that are

1392
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,819
associated with that so I think that

1393
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,680
owasp has a lot of resources that are

1394
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,900
really valuable for organizations that

1395
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,339
are looking to find the appropriate

1396
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,740
amount of transparency to have for

1397
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,180
software vendors communicating with

1398
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,280
their with their buyers I also think

1399
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,720
we're going to see this increasingly

1400
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,819
included in contract language right like

1401
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:25,920
right now there's a little bit of a

1402
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,020
social contract of hey if I find a

1403
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,060
horrible vulnerability uh you know in in

1404
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,920
your software uh you know you need to

1405
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,940
fix it or else I'm going to go public

1406
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,200
and if I go public you're going to look

1407
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,359
dumb uh or or Craven or whatever because

1408
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:37,920
you won't fix vulnerabilities and

1409
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,720
software uh you know we're increasingly

1410
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,520
seeing uh you know contract language

1411
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,700
that says like hey here's uh and this is

1412
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,560
hard it's this is hard to get

1413
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,300
like lock it down from a legal

1414
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,619
standpoint but that doesn't mean it

1415
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,240
can't be approached and we've seen some

1416
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,500
stuff of like hey vulnerability is

1417
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,180
classified like this here's the service

1418
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,560
level agreement these types of

1419
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,880
vulnerabilities have to be addressed on

1420
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,020
this time scale these types of

1421
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,160
vulnerabilities have to be addressed on

1422
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,660
another time scale

1423
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,400
um and and so on and so forth and so I

1424
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,140
think uh yeah I think that's a good

1425
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,700
Trend as well although it can be

1426
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,119
implemented in a very uh you know it can

1427
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,460
be implemented very poorly so what comes

1428
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,660
next out of this again I think we're

1429
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,700
seeing some executive interest I think

1430
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,380
we're seeing uh you know both uh you

1431
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,940
know practitioner interest on the devops

1432
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,660
side

1433
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,040
and I think we're going to see a drive

1434
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,520
for better transparency because we need

1435
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,440
to as an organization in in a market

1436
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,300
where everybody has to move very quickly

1437
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,220
but where there are serious security

1438
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,380
concerns about software Supply chains

1439
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,300
you know we need to find better ways to

1440
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,859
communicate and better ways to approach

1441
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:37,319
transparency

1442
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:39,119
um so here's a list of uh these links

1443
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,260
are all earlier in the slides as well

1444
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,880
just collect them all at the end and I

1445
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,319
think we've got a couple minutes for

1446
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,680
questions

1447
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,060
um and we've seen that where we and

1448
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,020
we've seen that in working with

1449
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,359
organizations about the log4j where one

1450
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,160
organization is like oh hey well our

1451
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,720
answer to our customers was we've got

1452
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,280
the an older version it's not vulnerable

1453
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,900
and the response back was like we don't

1454
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,339
care we don't want to see any we just

1455
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:01,740
don't want to see log4j below that right

1456
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,060
um and so a couple of thoughts like the

1457
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,280
sca vendors are starting or some of them

1458
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,540
are starting to incorporate like data

1459
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,339
flow and control flow so you can see

1460
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:11,579
like hey you're using component XYZ but

1461
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:13,560
like unless you call the method like

1462
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,560
cause denial of service yeah

1463
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,300
parentheses parentheses I can unless you

1464
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,619
call that method you know you're not

1465
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,359
vulnerable and so we're starting to see

1466
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,099
on the tooling side those get a little

1467
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:24,660
bit smarter so they don't kick up yeah

1468
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,400
because the standard SDA report is like

1469
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,960
yeah everything's totally screwed like

1470
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,579
thanks yeah

1471
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,500
um and uh you know as well as but and

1472
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,819
then we're also starting to see some

1473
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:35,099
vendors that will like I watch run times

1474
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:36,720
and say like hey yeah it's you you have

1475
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,980
that library but that never gets loaded

1476
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,540
in right or the scanning tools that say

1477
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,980
you have that library but you never

1478
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,260
touch the component that is or that the

1479
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,599
method that is vulnerable uh and but but

1480
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,619
the good news is like if you look at

1481
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,599
Cyclone DX and I forget I think it's ve

1482
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:52,140
or Vex v e x or ve uh vulnerability

1483
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,359
exploitability there is an extension or

1484
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,060
a component of cyclone DX that lets you

1485
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,520
characterize the s-bomb like hey yes

1486
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,140
this is definitely exploitable no this

1487
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,480
is not in use this is some questions and

1488
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,760
so as the tooling advances what we're

1489
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,500
also starting to see is the uh like the

1490
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,540
the standards Advance as well as the

1491
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,680
kind of the communication standards

1492
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,420
Advanced as well so that you can make a

1493
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,980
little more fine-grained or nuanced

1494
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,540
decisions about these things

1495
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,540
I'm sure

1496
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,859
I should probably make little bitly

1497
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:27,540
links like all the other

1498
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,300
nicer speakers here yep where do you see

1499
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,640
supply chain standards that are kind of

1500
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,980
emerging like salsa fitting in and how

1501
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,140
they can improve this whole picture

1502
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,119
right and so yeah so I've looked through

1503
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,880
salsa a little bit and I and I like it

1504
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,760
um and what I want to see like I'd like

1505
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,380
to see a little more

1506
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,240
that that kind of specificity about

1507
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,040
Community the the transparency of the

1508
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,960
communication right uh and what I like

1509
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,040
about salsa it's got like the different

1510
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,599
levels so it's not like hey you're doing

1511
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:56,099
this or you're not I think that's

1512
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,240
appropriate because then you can look

1513
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,319
and say well we've got you know for

1514
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,180
certain types of software or for a

1515
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,200
certain amount of time we can accept

1516
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,700
things at a lower level and then we want

1517
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,339
uh then we want some more what I'd like

1518
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:07,920
to see is that fit it fit better in with

1519
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,020
the the tooling that organizations are

1520
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,980
using but also uh more work on like how

1521
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,300
do we how do we communicate this

1522
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,640
transparency so that organizations can

1523
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,079
make the kind of nuanced decisions that

1524
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,420
this gentleman is is talking about

1525
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,160
and I think I'll be around if anybody

1526
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,420
has questions I want to not I don't want

1527
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,740
to run over

1528
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,320
[Music]

1529
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:33,269
