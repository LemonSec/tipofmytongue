1
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,080
foreign

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,280
so my name is Brad birkelen with Jay

3
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,239
scrambler

4
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,780
and I've been in appsec since about 2014

5
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,239
I've been in security since about 2000

6
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,640
uh pretty much I'm kind of a startup

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,060
Junkie uh for better or worse so I have

8
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,820
a lot of different different runs and

9
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,439
today we're going to focus on a

10
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,680
particular problem in web applications I

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,619
know the whole supply chain story is is

12
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,479
one of those kind of big areas right now

13
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,880
and we're going to look specifically

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,860
how that impacts your web applications

15
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,560
it's obviously been a massive shift over

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,659
the past few years and we're going to

17
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,220
get into all the problems you know

18
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,140
what's wrong with it of course and we're

19
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,060
going to keep piling them on but we are

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,920
going to get to some approaches that you

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,220
can take to to deal with this and so my

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,659
hope is that you leave

23
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,200
uh this afternoon uh more educated about

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,579
what some of the problems are some of

25
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,840
the approaches

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,960
and thank you all for braving coming

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,579
here instead of taking a nap right after

28
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,799
lunch

29
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,240
so

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,399
let's start in

31
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,840
and uh

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,220
to start let's do a little history

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,560
lesson here

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,540
so long ago

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,459
in a far away land

36
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,940
applications reside on a server

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,180
and the server was inside the perimeter

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,200
you had firewalls glass

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,280
protecting all that

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,780
sounds like a really great security

41
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,340
environment right

42
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,340
well kind of but what was on the servers

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,480
was junk

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,580
it wasn't really usable

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,000
and um people wanted to start marketing

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,860
people wanted to use those servers to

47
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,780
become more serious about driving

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,440
Revenue in the web apps

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,819
devops got pulled along to do things

50
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,239
faster so Along Comes JavaScript

51
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,580
JavaScript very feature Rich

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,599
and it exploded over the past 10 years

53
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,940
and one of the nice things about it not

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,000
only is it is a very feature-rich to

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,519
work with but over time a lot more

56
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,980
software libraries

57
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,980
um and tools emerged out there in the

58
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,620
third party Marketplace so people

59
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,239
started interacting with a lot of

60
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,659
third-party code in their code marketing

61
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,159
people are exciting remember a little

62
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,560
marketing guy or gal who you got to

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,260
ignore 10 years ago well now they have a

64
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,180
revenue person who tells security what

65
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,599
to do or more typically what not to do

66
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,300
and devops people are now you know

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,920
anybody have any friends and devops

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,500
anymore no

69
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,260
they don't want you around so

70
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,780
we are going to focus today

71
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,120
on what's going on here in the

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,819
production environment specifically

73
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,819
in the third third part code area what

74
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,220
that means the security teams what are

75
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,780
some of the new challenges and what are

76
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,760
the kind of approaches we can take to

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,239
deal with this

78
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,739
so um

79
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,140
sure you wear a mage cart web skimming

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,540
these sorts of things you may not know

81
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,840
the largest gdpr fine in history was a

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,879
meshkart attack

83
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,220
for 230 million dollars at British

84
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,480
Airways

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,540
and what happened in this case is four

86
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,500
weeks

87
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,519
uh web skimming attack was peeling data

88
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,400
off of the credit card page stealing

89
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,320
almost a half a million records

90
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,320
completely undetected until the breach

91
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,380
was discovered at which point it was

92
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,500
considered that you know British Airways

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,740
uh was it serious fault

94
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,320
now the interesting thing here was that

95
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
their code that had the problem no it

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,960
was a third party web application that

97
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,460
caused a problem what happened to those

98
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,020
guys I have no clue not a lot fault was

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,360
centered on British Airways so

100
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,340
regardless of the source of the code if

101
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,080
we have

102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
um any kind of transactions they're

103
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
doing online and we're using a third

104
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,100
party for processing the payment it's

105
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,900
still the fault of the person whose

106
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,540
website those transactions are happening

107
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,880
from so is that fair

108
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,240
not really but is it reality yes

109
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,040
and this isn't just British Airways

110
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,720
there's been a variety of others Delta

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,240
Best Buy chat room hack

112
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,639
um Live Nation this has really been kind

113
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,680
of a theme over the last two or three

114
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,800
years and it's been easy picking for the

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,620
bad guys to go in there and conduct

116
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,660
these attacks is my volume still okay by

117
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,740
the way

118
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,780
cool okay

119
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,820
so let's peel back

120
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,960
and get into the why this is happening

121
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,680
so one problem is again agile

122
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,039
environments code is being released

123
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,680
multiple times each month

124
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,840
some people as much as daily

125
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,479
and you know devops are getting really

126
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,460
good and again listening to the

127
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,400
marketing folks and releasing not lots

128
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,280
of new features lots of scripts are

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
coming and changing constantly but the

130
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,560
security team is still stuck

131
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,900
back in the you know one to maybe two

132
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,560
code review reviews per month and that's

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,720
a snapshot I'm sorry per year

134
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
and that's a snapshot in time of what's

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,240
going on well over here the web

136
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,580
applications are changing constantly so

137
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,740
there's really no real time code reviews

138
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,100
going on also a lot of that review is

139
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,160
your code you know pin testing is your

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,020
first party JavaScript code or whatever

141
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,759
you're running not third party

142
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,620
JavaScript code

143
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,680
so a lot of what's going on out there is

144
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
just happening without any supervision

145
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
whatsoever

146
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,620
so here's that's one problem

147
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,360
and there's more

148
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,400
so

149
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,740
modern day web applications now recent

150
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,860
statistics have well over half of all

151
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,060
the javascripts running on the

152
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,039
application on that web app are

153
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,900
third-party applications again there's

154
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,180
so many libraries and different tools

155
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,100
out there that it's just convenient you

156
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,020
can release things fast many of these

157
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,520
are very well known you know Google

158
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,560
Facebook

159
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,300
um you know Common well-known tools that

160
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,400
are constantly being used so they seem

161
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,620
they would be safe

162
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,479
um and on average a web application

163
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,780
might have 35 different third-party

164
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,860
components

165
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,919
so these people also call other

166
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,300
javascripts just like the web

167
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,880
applications calling third parties those

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,860
third parties are often calling fourth

169
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,500
parties and fifth parties so every time

170
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
you add a script it basically spirals

171
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,220
into a larger group of supply chain

172
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,259
vendors you're dealing with

173
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,259
and again no visibility What's Happening

174
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,080
Here and you know there's common you

175
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,020
know some examples on this page show

176
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,639
various analytics tools form validation

177
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,319
you've got a um

178
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,080
a chat bot over here you've got a video

179
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,699
player

180
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,039
um and you know what if for instance

181
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,080
somebody hacked into that video player

182
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,479
and started collecting login information

183
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,599
off that chat bot and that the hack has

184
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,819
happened in the past so these are the

185
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,979
kind of things that can run in the wild

186
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,300
without any supervision

187
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,080
so you might say at this point okay I'm

188
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,819
dealing with this it's you know to a

189
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,860
certain extent

190
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,140
first off I have a laugh

191
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,679
okay laugh is great at detecting

192
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,260
connections to the server and slopping

193
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,120
things like you know server-based SQL

194
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,740
injection attacks

195
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,420
not in the Dom

196
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,660
not at the browser so your WAFF is not

197
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,899
dealing with this new

198
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,779
um range of browser-based attacks that

199
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,640
are going on there

200
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,519
and you also might have a rasp a rasp is

201
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,959
really a

202
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,839
um a modern day laugh

203
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,300
there are also other approaches so

204
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,040
there's there's one

205
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,160
interesting native base protection among

206
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,019
our new browsers so there are security

207
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,060
features built into our new browsers

208
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,540
content security policy uh cell resource

209
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,980
Integrity I don't know if these are

210
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,000
familiar

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,180
Davey folks okay some of you so

212
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,760
uh deaf people can go and they can

213
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,500
update CSP

214
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,260
assuming they have the latest revision

215
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,459
every single build

216
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,620
and make sure that it's constantly

217
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,560
updated and they can catch a lot of

218
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,019
these threats

219
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,440
so is Dev want to inject security

220
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,140
into their practices

221
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,779
no a couple talks ago they talked about

222
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,720
that you got secops not Deb doing work

223
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,300
so CSP unfortunately it's just it's too

224
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,240
much work Google doesn't

225
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,000
and one or two other people that's it

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
they've got a massive team they can do

227
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,380
you know God bless them for that so the

228
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,420
rest of us are dealing with all these

229
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,760
scripts coming in all at the same power

230
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,920
so whatever page they're on they have

231
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,720
access to everything

232
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,420
they can collect whatever information

233
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,880
they want unless they're configured

234
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,080
correctly

235
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,660
they can send stuff out to external

236
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,899
domains and largely we don't know any of

237
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,120
that is going on

238
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,620
sound pretty

239
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,899
Rosy at this point

240
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,940
it gets worse

241
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,000
so the principle of least privilege

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,420
common security nomenclature here when

243
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,800
you're dealing with

244
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,540
um

245
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,940
access controls and so forth so many new

246
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,620
comes in they come in at the bottom with

247
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,480
the least amount of privileges

248
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,339
does this apply to third-party scripts

249
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,140
no

250
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,640
there's none

251
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,940
so take something like Facebook pixel

252
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,279
which is used by

253
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,040
a lot you know most websites they're

254
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,420
marketing people it's a it's a

255
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,640
well-known way to collect information

256
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,519
from ads and

257
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,980
tune your ads and collect user

258
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,459
statistics

259
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,459
you know well respected script well what

260
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,839
if you're a hospital

261
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,540
and Facebook pixel is running on a page

262
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,660
where you have patient information

263
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,800
are you going to feel good about that

264
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,360
are your compliance people are going to

265
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,579
feel good no

266
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,579
so here's a problem where any script

267
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,040
having access to everything even if it's

268
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,380
a respective script can do bad things

269
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,019
let alone if that script were hacked

270
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,760
thank you

271
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,480
now

272
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,579
let's say so the point here is it would

273
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,000
be nice to have some sort of way to make

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,740
sure that there's a fence around scripts

275
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,100
so they don't have access to everything

276
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,779
so let's say so we have a a particular

277
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:03,320
customer in our company who actually

278
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,459
configured a third-party script they're

279
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,399
using in their in their Dev team to

280
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,140
debug it real time it's an important

281
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,899
script for them and they initially when

282
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,579
they installed it configured it so that

283
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,200
it only had access to the appropriate

284
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,480
elements because it was on a credit card

285
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
processing page

286
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,320
so is that safe

287
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,540
sort of but over time no

288
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,120
so what happens is again they're

289
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,980
constantly doing new builds

290
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,079
and configurations can change

291
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,620
arbitrarily or the vendor of the script

292
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,740
in this case is constantly revving new

293
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,120
versions

294
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,760
at the browser so you're not even seeing

295
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,860
those new new versions in the

296
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,779
configuration changed

297
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,120
and then they had an environment where a

298
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,100
third party attempted to access

299
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,339
information on the credit card page and

300
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,860
send it off to a drop server

301
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,620
and again this was detected and stopped

302
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,380
but here's an example we've got a good

303
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,120
script doing the right things configured

304
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,579
correctly and over time that changed too

305
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,620
again the um

306
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,240
the bad guys out there always looking

307
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,399
for new approaches

308
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,860
um I even met a few at the at the dinner

309
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,920
last night for speakers

310
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,500
I am a proud owner of a new lock picking

311
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,899
kit I don't know how to use it I just

312
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,060
got instructions not to use it on a lock

313
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,820
that I would want to reuse

314
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,760
so as a first step

315
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,160
you want to have obviously some kind of

316
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,519
continuous monitoring in place and you

317
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,720
know first off

318
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,079
an inventory of what scripts are being

319
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,079
used on your website the known ones that

320
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,880
you purposefully use or you're whether

321
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
it's your marketing or whoever else as

322
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
well as the fourth and fifth party

323
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,180
scripts that are called up you know some

324
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,220
kind of

325
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,480
inventory so that you can as a security

326
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,139
team at least have visibility what's

327
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,700
going on in your environment

328
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,440
and then secondly

329
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,660
you want to see what's being added or

330
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,120
changed so when I

331
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,040
put up that slide showing an average of

332
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,639
35 strips and 31 fourth party scripts on

333
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,680
a on a web application if you take

334
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
snapshots each month those script counts

335
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,760
go up and down

336
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,339
because again your marketing folks are

337
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,920
constantly tuning the site to try new

338
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
things especially in e-commerce type

339
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,540
environment

340
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,040
and

341
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,320
you want to have some way to deal with

342
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,880
what happens when a script changes

343
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,639
Behavior it starts accessing information

344
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,000
it shouldn't or sending it somewhere it

345
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,560
shouldn't

346
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,660
and then finally what kind of measures

347
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,240
do you have to determine whether scripts

348
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,040
are trust really or not

349
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,839
and so these are some of the the

350
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,660
challenges of Security Professionals in

351
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,639
this environment where we're kind of

352
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,959
pushed out of band

353
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
you know leave us alone we got to work

354
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,480
quick but yet we need to support

355
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,000
that type environment

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,300
yeah how is uh when security can't do

357
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,339
things on the server to impact change

358
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,320
how is marketing getting code changes on

359
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,399
there so easily great point so um I

360
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,959
would argue that back in the old days

361
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,779
when I started off the CSO carried a

362
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,360
really big hammer and he he or she got

363
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,380
things done

364
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,260
well now the chief digital officer

365
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,019
carries that hammer and again especially

366
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,139
if you're a retail site or a banking

367
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:37,980
site

368
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,600
where

369
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,180
now a primary way that you get business

370
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,279
is on your web application

371
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,500
where you know 10 years ago or 15 years

372
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,600
ago it was secondary

373
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,920
or maybe it was just kind of

374
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,000
informational

375
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,220
we're announced primary so

376
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,920
you know revenue is King

377
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,740
and if you're slowing down my ability to

378
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,240
attract customers

379
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,639
and especially you know the way the

380
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,139
holiday seasons

381
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,760
um pop up and the

382
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,560
in the users go if you lose them once

383
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,899
you can lose them forever

384
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,600
and so that's and if someone else would

385
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,740
comment if you have a different

386
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,779
perspective on that

387
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,940
business wanting it as opposed to them

388
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,800
having a back door way to literally

389
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,680
allow the people work with put code on

390
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,240
the server I mean as engineering still

391
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,519
having to ultimately make changes on

392
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,380
their path or they find a way around

393
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,600
that too

394
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,459
my opinion

395
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,800
is that our job has gotten tougher

396
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,440
because we've been pushed out of band

397
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,139
a bit especially in web applications

398
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,440
by the business driving

399
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,199
the results I remember what 10 or 15

400
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,579
years ago

401
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,680
everyone decided that devops people

402
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,139
would learn security coding

403
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,720
in that they would Implement that you

404
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,699
know as best practice

405
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,480
and it hasn't happened why because they

406
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,579
don't have time for it

407
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,160
so you know agile means quicker quicker

408
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,179
quicker

409
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,859
more and more features again a lot of

410
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,020
these scripts that marketing are pushing

411
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,819
out are

412
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,679
um a lot of them are well known like

413
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,260
Google type scripts and so forth they're

414
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,179
trying some other ones

415
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,220
and um

416
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,099
yeah the fact is most security people

417
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,319
don't know what's running

418
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,540
on their web apps I don't know if anyone

419
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,059
would have a different answer

420
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:30,780
um

421
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,520
might be some different kind of thoughts

422
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,380
to that

423
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,600
okay I think I just went forward a bunch

424
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,039
oh no here we go

425
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,660
so

426
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,640
is a study

427
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,919
at a large retailer

428
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,480
of ours

429
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,059
last Black Friday

430
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,299
and we are they collected data over a 30

431
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,980
hour period

432
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,160
to see what was going on out there in

433
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,320
their in their third party scripts and

434
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,440
the results were astounding now they had

435
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
blocking in place so nothing actually

436
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,059
gotten got stolen here but they found

437
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,679
144

438
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,400
000

439
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,460
data records that third multiple third

440
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,240
parties had attempted to exfiltrate off

441
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,940
of their web application and a large

442
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,340
retailer or Black Friday 30 hour period

443
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,580
of which 9 000 contains sensitive data

444
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,860
that would have been harmful for them

445
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,740
and this number down here this is from a

446
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,960
2001 or 21 state of the web report by

447
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,460
IBM where they looked at average cost of

448
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,160
any sense of data record being stolen

449
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,620
180 dollars per record and this gets us

450
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,320
this 1.6 million dollar number in

451
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
savings that they determined that they

452
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
had from having controls in place

453
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,580
now the interesting thing here is

454
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,919
without visibility no one would have

455
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,480
known anything

456
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,240
so how often is this going on without

457
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,299
anyone knowing probably a lot

458
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,000
and more than just that record how many

459
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,940
of those customers might leave forever

460
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,559
again particularly if you're in some

461
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,720
kind of online Commerce you got you know

462
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
Amazon

463
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,140
um up there I know there's Amazon

464
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,700
speaker and we're in the Amazon room so

465
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,500
I don't wanna

466
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,559
there thank you but um

467
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,020
you know brick and mortars are

468
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,940
um going away this is this is important

469
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,419
that's the chief digital officer

470
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,760
um by the way I met a chief digital

471
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,460
officer at shop talk who did a talk and

472
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,679
I went up and introduced myself and

473
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,299
there was a line of sales people and the

474
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,919
person looked kind of annoyed

475
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,320
and I asked them

476
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,000
you know are you concerned with with

477
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,460
Revenue losing revenue from people

478
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,140
stealing information off your site or

479
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,080
redirect the users the person said yes

480
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,600
and I asked would you would you deal

481
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,240
with this and your team he goes no

482
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,559
here's my email I'll put you in touch

483
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,880
with our CSO

484
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,700
so that's a real shift in Dynamic from

485
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,520
again the old days where the CSO was was

486
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,799
kind of King of the Kingdom

487
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,580
um

488
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,039
so anyway very interesting results from

489
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,460
this uh from this study

490
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,940
so

491
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,679
now we get to the um

492
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,480
recommendations

493
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,220
and I'll start with kind of a long list

494
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,600
and then we'll peel it down into

495
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,860
specifics

496
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,900
but you know on the left

497
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,440
having first some way to again repeating

498
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,940
myself

499
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,160
an inventory and there's different tools

500
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,260
out there will provide an inventory of

501
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,600
third-party scripts so you just at least

502
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,640
know what you're dealing with

503
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,919
and then

504
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,980
uh second from the left

505
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,260
we really need to get more

506
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,419
exposure from the CSO

507
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,140
to get protection of web resources on

508
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,660
the csos risk register

509
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,520
just better articulating I know in

510
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,580
appsec we've always been

511
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,419
um

512
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,940
uh kind of fighting upward to get

513
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,160
attention because a lot of people really

514
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,960
don't understand what we do

515
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,539
but this is a big one and this is now

516
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,700
becoming Again part of the revenue

517
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,559
uh key the revenue for the organization

518
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,900
so we really need to get you know more

519
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,380
resources uh head count in the companies

520
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,299
you work at as well as you know their

521
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,640
third parties who can provide manage

522
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,820
type service resources for us

523
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,440
and then third

524
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,960
we need to consider this is a this is a

525
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,020
real-time problem we're dealing with so

526
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,179
just having

527
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,360
some way to look at scripts the actual

528
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,760
attacks are happening at the browser at

529
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,799
the user side you know outside our

530
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,020
perimeter in real time and we need to

531
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,140
have visibility you know 24x7 monitoring

532
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,480
to see what's what's really happening

533
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,919
again

534
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,780
you have a great snapshot Black Friday

535
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,000
comes and all the bad stuff happens and

536
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,500
we miss it

537
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,360
and then we've talked about this a few

538
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,559
times now

539
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,020
the agile environment is here to here to

540
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,620
stay and it's going to get faster

541
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,340
and

542
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,260
um we're not going to become better

543
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,980
friends and it get inserted in so how do

544
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,960
we work out a band effectively

545
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,780
that's really a key one what can we do

546
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,580
you know outside of the kind of critical

547
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,980
path of getting code released but still

548
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,360
have intelligence to provide to add

549
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,100
council that helps these people be

550
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,580
successful that's that's a key one

551
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,740
um fourth or fifth fifth are the

552
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,480
compliance requirements in your

553
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,460
organization

554
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,000
obviously these change by organization

555
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,600
um

556
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,640
they're getting more stringent

557
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,400
just to throw some more gasoline on the

558
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,840
Fire

559
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,260
um PCI DSS version four not sure if

560
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,320
you're aware this spring just came out

561
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,860
and said any site that has credit card

562
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,240
processing

563
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
on it that credit card processing page

564
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,120
you have to have monitoring and some

565
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,760
kind of control of all scripts on that

566
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,000
page by the start of 2025.

567
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,539
so which isn't too far away given all

568
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,000
the Dynamics working on organization so

569
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
there are things coming down the pipe

570
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,500
that are going to push us to address

571
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,260
this sooner than later

572
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,240
and then

573
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,120
um second to last

574
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,419
having some sort of way to mitigate or

575
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,720
prevent these breaches from occurring in

576
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,059
real time so we haven't really spoken

577
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,980
about blocking but some kind of

578
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,900
technology to address that

579
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,720
and then finally here's where we have

580
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,220
the nice rainbow

581
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,340
where we catch problems early you know

582
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,580
cso's happy we're happy

583
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,020
um you know we're playing more golf

584
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,960
we're surfing in my case

585
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,580
um last two probably won't happen

586
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,960
because there'll be other fires to put

587
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,679
out

588
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,100
but the thought is here is delete this

589
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,440
is a process to

590
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,900
um gain access to information and deal

591
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,380
with information in real time

592
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,299
so I want to look at some

593
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,640
approaches now to do this

594
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,919
and there are there are multiple tools

595
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,900
out there now that provide inventory

596
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,539
here's an example of one where you have

597
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,480
a look at the scripts

598
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,659
and there's ability to click on the

599
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,740
scripts to see more information

600
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,260
and you know this would be a first start

601
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,960
to at least getting some information you

602
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,000
know what these are you know the first

603
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,760
recommendation I would have is is you

604
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,799
know visibility

605
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,260
and then from here

606
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,000
there are some tools that allow you to

607
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,679
drill down a little deeper

608
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,020
so this particular one I know it's kind

609
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,460
of going back and forth but it's got a

610
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,780
list of scripts

611
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,059
on the left and then it's showing one

612
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,220
being clicked on and it's looking at

613
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,440
specific data fields I know it's kind of

614
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,860
small but there's personal data and

615
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,799
there's payment data and it's looking at

616
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,780
particular fields

617
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,679
in there and the ability to look at what

618
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,240
is what um

619
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,820
fields that script has access to

620
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,340
and what Fields they're exfiltrating

621
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,480
from

622
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,220
so here's something you could use to go

623
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,200
in if something looks suspicious

624
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,360
and really see what's happening in real

625
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,340
time

626
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,700
this is Jace Rambler yeah

627
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,340
a Shameless plug

628
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,299
um

629
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,940
and I would I would argue that um

630
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,799
from a compliance standpoint with the

631
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,120
organization

632
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,400
you probably want to make sure if you're

633
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
using a third party vendor they don't

634
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,240
see the actual sensitive data either

635
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,980
especially if they have a cloud type

636
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,080
service you don't want that stripped off

637
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,360
but be able to see the actual types of

638
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,580
fields that are being accessed

639
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,200
and then

640
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,059
here's where

641
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,220
it gets really interesting

642
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,440
and this will be adding controls to

643
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,380
fence what particular scripts have

644
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,880
access to

645
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,240
so in this example we have a chat bot

646
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,940
and these are all the different elements

647
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,340
on the field or in the page that chatbot

648
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,880
has access to and so first off there are

649
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,980
certain types of things like the Dom web

650
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,159
apis it needs to access in order to

651
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,779
function correctly

652
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,120
and then there so that be a case for you

653
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,179
to open up access to those completely

654
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,779
and then there's others like cookies or

655
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,480
other JavaScript code where they never

656
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,940
need access so there's a case where you

657
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,860
can just fence those off

658
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,140
but then there's a third set of elements

659
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,600
that are more conditional so for

660
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,340
instance with forms

661
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,640
bless you the um the chat bot you

662
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,900
probably don't have that have it

663
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,080
actually have access to the username in

664
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,159
their email

665
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,260
in order to have a a better

666
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,380
correspondence with that person but if

667
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,059
they have a login field

668
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,860
on that email form

669
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,900
you would not want the chat bot to have

670
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,240
access to that so there's a case where

671
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,000
you'd fence particular elements within a

672
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,960
form

673
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,940
now with this with these type of

674
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,140
controls

675
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,679
if the behavior of this script changed

676
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,980
let's say the script itself was hacked

677
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,900
from a third party standpoint which you

678
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,820
can't control it's outside your

679
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,820
environment and in a way that

680
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,480
it's now exfiltrating passwords off that

681
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,799
form field

682
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,260
then in the trades when the hack shows

683
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,900
up it would name the other people who

684
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,940
are at fault and your company wouldn't

685
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,260
be on that list

686
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,419
in fact you might even pointed out as

687
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,760
having controls in place that mitigated

688
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,320
that attack

689
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,179
which can become a competitive Advantage

690
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,720
when it comes to shopping alternatives

691
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,500
so this is a forum again that also can

692
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,539
be applied

693
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,460
if you play this to every single page

694
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,799
you're putting overload on your

695
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,900
environment but if you only go to the

696
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,419
system Pages anywhere where there's

697
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,640
let's say passwords

698
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,980
being inputted anywhere where there's

699
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,320
credit card information being put in the

700
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,700
place where there's you know login

701
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,419
information or payment data so it can

702
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,419
really be three or four pages per site

703
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,820
that you set up these these types of

704
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,200
rules for

705
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,779
now the bad guys in this case

706
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,080
if they're if they um

707
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,600
do something do a script on one of your

708
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,580
pages you don't you don't care about

709
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,539
they're not going to get anything

710
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,659
there's no sensitive data on that page

711
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:00,900
but if they try on one of your um

712
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,880
Pages again that has sensitive data they

713
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,760
would they would be prevented

714
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,880
so I want to go ahead and switch and go

715
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,900
into a demo at this point

716
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,100
and a little bit cheesy but we're gonna

717
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,980
we're gonna go with it here

718
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,960
so

719
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,580
oops

720
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,980
then we went away

721
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,399
okay this is why I don't do these

722
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,100
yeah I just closed it instead of

723
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,320
expanding it

724
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,539
okay so we're gonna go shopping for

725
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:37,879
shoes oops I am disconnected

726
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,380
see what happened

727
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,220
um

728
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,000
come back

729
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,600
should I pull it out and plug it back in

730
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,220
there

731
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,360
something's going on

732
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,940
okay awesome

733
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,460
okay so we're gonna go online

734
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,500
and we're gonna go

735
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,159
shoe shopping

736
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,360
so I'm

737
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,159
I want to buy some shoes which is kind

738
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,659
of funny because I usually just wear

739
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:22,980
flip-flops

740
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,159
but um I'm gonna give this a try so here

741
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,779
I am and I'm looking at things that are

742
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:30,240
ridiculously priced notice which I would

743
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,260
never do

744
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,220
flip flops cost like 20 30 bucks

745
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,899
it's a one pair of dress shoes I've had

746
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,940
for the last like five years

747
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,399
okay so I picked some out

748
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:42,899
and

749
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,080
the 375 dollars and for some reason I'm

750
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,179
buying two pairs which is 750 or maybe

751
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,419
that's 30 to 75 per shoe I'm not sure

752
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,760
but I'm going to go in here and I'm

753
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,380
going to fill out you know the

754
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,700
information you know pretty

755
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,000
straightforward stuff I've got my uh

756
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
uh

757
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,419
you know name and address and phone

758
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:04,980
number and that sort of thing

759
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,020
and then I go to payment page

760
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,000
and again the normal information we'd

761
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,500
see

762
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,120
um I mean you can copy the credit card

763
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,440
number and try it

764
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,600
uh

765
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,880
but I've been putting all this in and

766
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,799
I'm going to go to make a payment

767
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,899
and then I'll experience what you know

768
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,399
every user sees

769
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,640
which is confirmation so great I'm going

770
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,340
to get my shoes now I wouldn't expect I

771
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,140
wouldn't see this next screen but for

772
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,419
the purpose of the demo we've got attack

773
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:34,740
detected

774
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,600
and we're going to go in and look in

775
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,980
this tool and we're going to see this

776
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,260
red Spike something happened I know that

777
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,240
was kind of quick but we found this

778
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,159
particular script that we're zeroing in

779
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,480
on

780
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,419
um you know the red severity at High

781
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,240
and we find out that there's a problem

782
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,120
so we're going to go in and we're going

783
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,820
to look at inventory and

784
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,820
um just off the top we see there's 30

785
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,799
scripts on this site from 17 different

786
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,000
vendors

787
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,940
and we can scroll down and we can look

788
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,520
at the different scripts we can see how

789
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,799
many sections they're in

790
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,520
um

791
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,940
you can see which ones are active or not

792
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,580
um and you know various information this

793
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,899
is all kind of good here we can pick one

794
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,100
I think we're going to pick Microsoft

795
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,840
Clarity which is

796
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,140
a safe script and we can look at details

797
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,419
about this and we see there's two

798
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,240
scripts actually for Microsoft Clarity

799
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,760
that are that are running

800
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,159
we can get an overview of what these

801
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,360
scripts do

802
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,100
just because we're probably not going to

803
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,140
know we can see what sections they're in

804
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,159
the product there's two and product

805
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,860
pages you know payment so forth

806
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,380
and we can so now we're going to go into

807
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,360
this Express ad so this is a bad one we

808
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,200
found

809
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,539
and we're going to see that it's running

810
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,600
on a checkout page so that's not good

811
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,279
and um

812
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,320
so we know there's a problem there

813
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,179
and we're going to go now into a

814
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:04,980
different dashboard the sensitive data

815
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,820
dashboard

816
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,820
and again we have some just information

817
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,019
up top

818
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,760
but we're going to click on this Express

819
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,039
ads script and we're going to look over

820
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,620
here and see the different fields that

821
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,440
it has access to so basically just

822
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
validating

823
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,159
that um

824
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,620
you know in the payment side there are

825
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,940
some things that are grayed and some are

826
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,700
bold all those bold ones were payment

827
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,340
details we see here there's form data

828
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,620
access there's network transfer

829
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,120
and we're looking at all the specific

830
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,299
details now that this ad is accessing

831
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,620
you know it should have access to credit

832
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,480
card information and we're seeing it's

833
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,299
transferring it out off our website so

834
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,700
definitely not good

835
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,799
so we're going to block this

836
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,860
and in this case the vendor is providing

837
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,960
kind of pre

838
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,679
um

839
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,200
pre-built

840
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,760
policies and so all you would have to do

841
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,039
is just enable or disable

842
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,620
by Script and so we're blocking

843
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,418
essentially the ability for that script

844
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,480
to read or send out payment information

845
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,879
it could still do its other job

846
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,980
because that's not harmful so now I'm

847
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,480
going to go back in and I'm going to buy

848
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,280
more shoes

849
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,219
and I'm getting even more expensive ones

850
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,918
so I guess the last ones didn't cover I

851
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:26,699
don't know

852
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,280
but uh I got the same information I'm

853
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,719
putting in

854
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,760
and I'm even feeling bold and I'm going

855
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,440
to see if the same credit card details

856
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,820
work

857
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,280
and um

858
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,520
let me go back in and and see what what

859
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,040
happens this time now we're blocking

860
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,560
the nefarious part of the script from

861
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,320
executing which we've essentially fenced

862
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,700
so I'm going to hit make a payment

863
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,780
and now as a user I see the same exact

864
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,400
thing I saw before

865
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,560
from a user standpoint I didn't know

866
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,060
before my credit card details were

867
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,760
stolen but now I know they weren't and

868
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,560
we can go back in we can see that same

869
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,079
event we can see down here in this case

870
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,300
it was blocked

871
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,099
and we can go and look at the specific

872
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,560
details on that we can also see where in

873
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,140
the code it was injected and we can see

874
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,660
the specific code in red that it that

875
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,640
was injected so if we go to our third

876
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,640
party vendor we can say fix that

877
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,680
uh but in the meantime

878
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,040
even before they fixed it we blocked it

879
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,079
so the user experience is identical

880
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,000
they're the user is not experiencing

881
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,500
anything different than they did before

882
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,160
all that's happening is it's blocked and

883
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,800
this tool is providing the security team

884
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
with details about that block

885
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,839
so now you go back to your you made it

886
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,980
decide

887
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,260
that it's worth well probably the third

888
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,780
party vendor management team is going to

889
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,579
want to know but in this case it didn't

890
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:02,460
impact anything in your code so devops

891
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,200
may or may not want to know maybe

892
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,640
there's some way you can

893
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,220
uh changing to Future revision or not

894
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,380
but the key is that that you're running

895
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,680
safe

896
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,480
Okay so

897
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,619
one last slide

898
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,160
um

899
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,099
and basically what the heck oh yeah

900
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,180
sorry just

901
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,220
a brain problem here

902
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,859
user error

903
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,279
okay

904
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,259
one last try here tell you what

905
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,660
it's not pretty

906
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,480
why am I not

907
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,020
all right

908
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,359
not pretty oh there you go okay

909
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,240
so final thoughts summarize what we just

910
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,119
saw so we talked about modern day web

911
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,540
applications are truly a mishmash the

912
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,640
first and third party code

913
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,339
and by and large security teams just do

914
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,920
not have visibility they can't keep up

915
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,900
with the change of pace to what's going

916
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,480
on out there

917
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,980
um we talked about a little bit about

918
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,740
supply chain attacks base cart web

919
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,140
skimmers they're in the trades

920
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,220
constantly

921
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,740
and they're not going away you know so

922
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,079
it's wide open playing around for the

923
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,400
bad guys

924
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,460
we talked about common security tools

925
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,339
don't address this problem because it

926
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,260
occurs at the browser

927
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,359
and those requests are not coming back

928
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,599
to your server in most cases so you're

929
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,980
not going to see any of this stuff

930
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,480
that's going on

931
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,960
so forget the perimeter you know the

932
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,060
browser is is a perimeter

933
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,240
and we also mentioned there's a couple

934
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,579
browser-based tools CSP and SRI that can

935
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,380
do a lot of this work they'll require

936
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,520
just constantly vigilance and updating

937
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,839
in order to keep working and if they

938
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,480
aren't updated it could impact the user

939
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,180
experience as well

940
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,200
um

941
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,260
we talked about visibility control as a

942
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,520
key

943
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,740
and having

944
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,520
um

945
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,280
a policy in place to prepare for PCI DSS

946
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,900
version four

947
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,940
and we talked about rules-based

948
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,079
approaches to basically fencing scripts

949
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,339
so the idea and hope here is that these

950
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,079
problems have been demystified a little

951
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:37,980
bit

952
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,880
and we can look at succeeding in this

953
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,960
world

954
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,220
not trying to get back into devops and

955
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,640
insert ourselves into more of their

956
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,339
process but actually running

957
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,520
next to them in the next Lane over in

958
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,980
gathering intelligence and helping them

959
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,320
and being you know seen as more of a

960
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,380
service and also being able to scale as

961
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,020
they scale as they're moving faster we

962
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,060
can move faster

963
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,780
so that gets us to I'll be on time

964
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,720
oh I'm way well

965
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,980
yeah

966
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,839
so

967
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,560
dance

968
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,020
yeah so she asked a little about because

969
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,700
we're a third party how do we sandbox

970
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,980
this so there's two products we have

971
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,740
we've um we've been doing JavaScript

972
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,660
since the start of time

973
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,599
and our CTO Pedro Fortuna is one of the

974
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,119
known guys in the industry so we're very

975
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,220
good at obfuscating first party

976
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,560
JavaScript code first off we have like

977
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,960
50 000 clients

978
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,820
um this service has been around for

979
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,280
about three years so we essentially you

980
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,980
would load a um a widget

981
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,960
and and you don't want to load that

982
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,300
first and it's protected with our code

983
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,880
Integrity obfuscation uh products so

984
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,220
it's going to be extremely hard to break

985
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,280
and then from there we're we're not

986
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,800
sandboxing we're essentially looking at

987
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,020
what's occurring in the browser and

988
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,119
you're applying these these rules based

989
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,339
on those policies they've been set up so

990
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,880
it's very fast I know there's

991
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,040
there's concerns with performance with

992
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,079
some tools we're not going through that

993
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,400
sandboxing foreign

994
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,339
yeah so she asked if they could be local

995
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,880
or so normally it's

996
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,220
um served through the cloud

997
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,200
and we're not we don't have access again

998
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,420
any to any of that sensitive data per se

999
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,119
with some of our large Financial clients

1000
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,060
they want it local so we will set up an

1001
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,460
instance locally in that case it's a

1002
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,079
little more involved but we can do that

1003
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,079
that might be easier for the recording

1004
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,180
but I can speak up louder yeah so you

1005
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,240
talked about uh the devops I one way

1006
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,040
that you can go through and make it a

1007
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,359
little bit easier when they're doing

1008
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,900
their QA or uat you have co-op stack in

1009
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,079
there so the same type of uh synthetic

1010
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,420
scripts that they're using for that

1011
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,300
basically put in Jack so that they're

1012
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,240
not having to rewrite but zap can grab

1013
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,240
in okay there's selenium scripts and so

1014
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,339
you know using

1015
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:38,280
another OS Flagship product that makes

1016
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,040
it a little bit easier there and one

1017
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,320
thing that probably most people didn't

1018
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,740
pick up on at the very beginning one of

1019
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,800
your slides did have slash monitoring.js

1020
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,339
and if you're not aware of so you've got

1021
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,680
the Google analyx for marketing but then

1022
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,599
your APM application performance

1023
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,339
management team they're going to have

1024
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,800
those monitoring javascripts and

1025
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,800
depending on how that's configured that

1026
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,960
could be sending it back over to a SAS

1027
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,800
server and get that SAS server has open

1028
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,980
apis then that's another attack Vector

1029
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,680
where having that protection on the

1030
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,320
JavaScript side you're preventing the

1031
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,780
hacker the attacker from going to that

1032
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,079
vendor and using their open apis so

1033
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,599
that's another

1034
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:28,680
consideration when you're looking at

1035
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,540
JavaScript so I might have you respond

1036
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,200
to the next question

1037
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,300
that's good thank you

1038
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,320
any others

1039
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,579
you're talking about

1040
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:43,619
um the retail environment when I've

1041
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,480
worked in retail you know we had a

1042
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,220
moratorium on changes starting before

1043
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,440
Thanksgiving and through Christmas and

1044
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,780
then we had to have somebody who was

1045
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,579
relatively new volunteered to be on

1046
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,940
football during Christmas yeah for a few

1047
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,540
years and if if something had to be

1048
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,180
changed like during that shopping week

1049
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,339
that Precision you could not change that

1050
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:06,599
you're like do you want to kill

1051
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,060
Christmas

1052
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,619
no that's right I mean we're all going

1053
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,780
in that lockdown now

1054
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,099
um I didn't mention too you know what

1055
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,380
kind of web applications would you care

1056
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,300
about this with again if you have

1057
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,540
informational sites that really just um

1058
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,760
shares some information around the you

1059
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,040
know the company earnings reports what

1060
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,240
our products are

1061
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,760
well it's not you know it's no sensitive

1062
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,760
data so we really see this I talked

1063
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,859
about you know shopping a lot and

1064
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:37,140
financial those those the biggies also

1065
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,280
Health Care

1066
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,500
travel industry

1067
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,300
those are some of the ones you know

1068
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,020
there's

1069
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,480
again customer transactions or sensitive

1070
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,579
data that's being sent

1071
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,760
support mobile and extensions does this

1072
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,060
tool support mobile native applications

1073
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,920
so we have so on the obfuscation side

1074
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,720
so we're JavaScript Focus

1075
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,700
from our side

1076
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,980
we do a lot also on the protection of

1077
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,560
the first party code itself and our

1078
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,859
partner right here is Imperium is

1079
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,839
joining us they do the native side there

1080
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:21,900
so we work closely with them

1081
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,940
on an engineering level support level

1082
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,599
you can buy through either company

1083
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,680
on that side when you're talking about

1084
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,079
your own applications and the reason we

1085
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,900
do that is everybody tends to have both

1086
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,200
you know native mobile and web-based

1087
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,839
applications some company like Financial

1088
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,359
starts with the web-based and then they

1089
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,300
eventually get to Mobile

1090
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,579
others start the other way around so

1091
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,900
that's the guy right there

1092
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,280
okay

1093
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,400
so at the beginning

1094
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,099
and he said CSV is difficult not many

1095
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,380
folks implemented yeah how do you sell

1096
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,819
the product for folks that do have a

1097
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:11,160
strong CSV what are the advantages of

1098
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,140
your product in that case yeah

1099
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,200
so there's a few people out there so the

1100
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,359
advantages would be it's it's less of

1101
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:19,680
their time

1102
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,540
to be constantly updating it and

1103
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,780
changing it we do provide more richness

1104
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,520
around the visibility

1105
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,020
than CSP

1106
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,440
so some of the um the inventory

1107
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,180
information the sense of data

1108
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,240
information is more Rich the idea of a

1109
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,099
fencing Scripts

1110
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,500
is more evolved and then the ability to

1111
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,780
see you know specifically where the code

1112
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,140
is injected what changes it made in the

1113
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,540
code we're able to show more detail but

1114
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,460
if somebody

1115
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,839
um well for instance we're not going to

1116
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,839
sell to Google because they they are one

1117
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,460
of the inventors of CSP

1118
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,500
and they've got teams of people

1119
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,359
supporting it I mean they do a good job

1120
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:03,900
doing it so in some cases we can't

1121
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,500
um

1122
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,660
so before Joanie J Scrambler I was with

1123
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,819
the company called tall security for

1124
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:12,300
four years and our claim to fame was we

1125
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,960
automated CSP we did it for you and we

1126
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,300
emerged as kind of a leader in this

1127
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,380
space

1128
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,780
but we ran out of cash at the end of

1129
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,839
covid and then I went I liked the space

1130
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,460
I went and looked at who do I think as

1131
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,740
the best technology it was Jason Rambo

1132
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,060
that's why I came here

1133
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,540
but um it was somewhat more effective in

1134
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,660
an automated way but I don't see anybody

1135
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,720
really adopting it uh again just because

1136
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,300
of the pace of change in the agile

1137
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,720
process

1138
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,420
what do you see as best practice is you

1139
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,520
know to begin with right so so this is

1140
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,040
great if you've got bajillions of

1141
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,780
scripts out there but granted I'm

1142
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,359
playing on easy mode but we've got one

1143
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,000
production site and we know what scripts

1144
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,240
are there and we have CSP and that's

1145
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,440
documented

1146
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,280
but what can you do prior to use that

1147
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,900
connection as well increase to reduce

1148
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,760
your needs or something like this so

1149
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,980
it's a good question so I would say

1150
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,640
um

1151
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,980
first off how does this kind of fall in

1152
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,740
your whole risk risk register

1153
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,440
um if you're an online platform like an

1154
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,099
airline or or a site where all of your

1155
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,020
business is done

1156
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,180
um throw online transactions it's

1157
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,319
probably high

1158
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,200
so you want to go deeper it may not be

1159
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,119
the case so first is how you know how

1160
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,000
critical is this and then you mentioned

1161
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,980
the the visibility I would say is number

1162
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,819
two

1163
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:47,700
you know what scripts are running

1164
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,040
on my site and do I have a way to see

1165
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,920
which ones are changing and from a

1166
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,839
security standpoint I can go do my own

1167
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:59,040
research and look at how um how trusted

1168
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,500
those scripts are you know the Google

1169
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,780
ones are probably pretty good

1170
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,380
um

1171
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,020
and then again if you're if you're at a

1172
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,460
place where this is something that you

1173
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,800
need to put attention into that's where

1174
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,740
I'd go into the more

1175
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,020
advanced tools to allow you to see you

1176
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,240
know what are those scripts accessing

1177
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,740
and

1178
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,660
um you know put together measures to

1179
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,060
prevent those from from doing harm so

1180
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,579
I'd take a layered approach depending on

1181
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:30,060
on how critical the uh uh well what's

1182
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,020
the impact of loss

1183
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,780
all right well thank you I'll be around

1184
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,760
for a little bit afterwards is there any

1185
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,060
other questions
