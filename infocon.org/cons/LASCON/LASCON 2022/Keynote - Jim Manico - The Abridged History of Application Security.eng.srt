saying thank you to our Platinum

8
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,379
sponsors we couldn't do this without

9
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,600
them hey Jeff Williams a contrast thank

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,680
you for getting your checkbook out

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,080
Amazon and a prio thank you all for for

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,360
taking this conference seriously you put

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,040
money down you become a platinum sponsor

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,119
that means you're serious about

15
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,920
investing in application security I

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,780
appreciate you so this is going to be an

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,939
extremely Abridged take on application

18
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,280
security I'm going to stick to about 45

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,740
minutes or so in this talk so my name is

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,960
Jim manico and I bought one of the one

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,520
of your former board members of the open

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,159
web application security project my

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,500
blood bleeds blue I really love this

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,140
Foundation the staff the work that we do

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,880
as a community and applications security

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,579
owas means something to me and I'm glad

27
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,220
you're all here I'm the founder and CEO

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,020
of my own firm Mana code security I

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,460
teach developers how to write secure

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,040
code it's something I love to do and I

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
spend a lot of tier a lot of my time

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,079
volunteering for OAS as a lead of the

33
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,540
asvs standard the cheat sheet series a

34
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,460
couple Java utility projects and the

35
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,159
proactive controls I tried my best to

36
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,720
donate my knowledge back to the

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,820
foundation to help push application

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,540
security forward but where did we start

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,759
where did application security start and

40
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,818
it's debatable but in my world like I

41
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,879
look at the 1967 task force in the U.S

42
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,680
federal government doing the first

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,980
classified study asking the question hey

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,239
we're starting to build a lot of

45
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,940
software systems here how are we doing

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,540
how is the security of software that's

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,640
beginning to run the infrastructure of

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
the United States right that's and how

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
do you think that report went it was it

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,680
was uh done in 1967 it was published as

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,680
a private report in 1970 and we all got

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
to look at it in 75 when it got

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,420
Declassified what do you think this this

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,840
report this first major security audit

55
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,180
of a major government what do you think

56
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,640
this report said

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,940
what's that no it said that that bleep

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,860
is messed up my friend's the opposite of

59
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,739
that it's bad and the report basically

60
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,379
said we don't have Security in software

61
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,019
it's that bad so this is where we begin

62
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,480
and the reason I want to start here is

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,120
because I know a lot of you in the jobs

64
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,640
that you're doing is anybody here a

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,280
little stressed out frustrated or

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
burdened from the job that they do in

67
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,120
application security come on seriously

68
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,120
so there's a there is a lot of massive

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,819
stress and a feeling of frustration that

70
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,760
we're not moving forward especially when

71
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,280
you're zoomed into your job sitting

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,280
there reviewing like 500 fighting pen

73
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,459
test report or or security scan and

74
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,500
you're triaging it going what am I doing

75
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,900
with my life let's zoom out whoa whoa

76
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,879
whoa whoa let's zoom out a bit let's

77
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,459
look at the last 50 years and I want to

78
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,519
show you a different perspective

79
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,440
the real First Security testing tool

80
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,680
that I can find in history is 1938 this

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,799
is now like polish researchers and it

82
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,720
wasn't the English who were able to

83
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,519
crack Enigma it's actually a Polish

84
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,900
researcher who did that original

85
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,260
research that that um the various

86
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,120
English researchers took over and

87
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,700
expanded to help crack Enigma now this

88
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,819
testing tool the bomb what was it it was

89
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,459
it was a it was a cipher cracking tool

90
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,978
to crack early encryption do you know

91
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,798
how the bomb was built back in 38

92
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,779
it was built with the hammer and nail

93
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,540
and wire it was a physical device that

94
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,199
was constructed that was used to crack

95
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,060
ciphers that helped the Allies win World

96
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,300
War II we wouldn't that single security

97
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,300
testing tool Changed History like

98
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,960
nothing else and again Hammer Nails wire

99
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,540
wood is what that tool was made out of

100
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,120
that's where we started now there's a

101
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
big gap in security testing about

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,600
1965 what's going on in 65 William

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
Matthews finds a security bug and multic

104
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,340
ctss and we're going to come back to

105
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,199
that there's a couple interesting

106
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,800
findings around mutix ctss this is a

107
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,500
really early time sharing server at MIT

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,780
so we're gonna come back to that in just

109
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,000
a little bit

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
1972 a really famous security report the

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
Anderson report is published around the

112
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
same time as these other Federal reports

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
and they're all saying the same thing we

114
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,380
just don't have Security in modern

115
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,360
software where that's running the

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,940
country so in 74 the Air Force starts

117
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,000
doing real testing in 79 lent is

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,280
published the first early static

119
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,620
analysis tool it does barely any

120
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,199
security at all but it's the it's it's

121
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,479
the early Tech that drives static

122
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,340
analysis which is the heart of our

123
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,199
industry right now if you're not doing

124
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,060
static analysis you're negligent come on

125
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,300
run subsetic analysis people 1995 we

126
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,220
have the Security administrator tool for

127
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,139
analyzing networks this gets released

128
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,660
and this is epic this is the first time

129
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,539
a real Combat testing tool against

130
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,240
Windows is available to everyone I

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,500
remember this coming out we're

132
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,840
downloading it and we could suddenly own

133
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,240
everything overnight and this really

134
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,919
leveled the playing field in terms of

135
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,500
our ability to hack Modern systems as a

136
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,820
security industry we all were playing

137
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,880
with this and it was epic so 1998

138
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,820
Christmas Day crack magazine 54

139
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,520
rainforest puppy Jeff Forrestal coined

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,400
the term SQL injection for the first

141
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,319
time one of the biggest vulnerabilities

142
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,479
within our industry from that point on

143
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,720
for the next 20 years SQL injection is

144
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,280
the number one way we're attacking

145
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,340
websites or or assessing websites

146
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,900
depending on what your your uh

147
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,680
perspective is 1999 Microsoft coins the

148
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,300
term cross-site scripting for a first

149
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,600
time this is not that long ago and like

150
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
2001 we could we see webgo coming out

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,580
metasploits released SQL map gets

152
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,580
released in 2006 at this point all of us

153
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,520
who are testers or hackers have a mature

154
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,699
tool Suite to assess the security of web

155
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,400
software and just a few years before

156
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,919
that we were barely getting started look

157
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,979
back in 99 we see Gary McGraw John

158
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,800
villega and Brad Arkin forming the first

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,139
code review team for security they're

160
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,639
working at visa and all these big

161
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,160
companies who write a lot of code where

162
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,740
security matters so that industry

163
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,900
security who's doing security code

164
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,880
review is part of their work now in some

165
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,580
way like most of us in the room that

166
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,900
only started back in 99

167
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,060
Services Loft and a few others were

168
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,340
doing it too but this didn't start that

169
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,919
long ago and they were like 25 years

170
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,960
passed where it's a relatively mature

171
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,419
industry so web goats coming out now we

172
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,120
have this common website that we're all

173
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,340
talking about about how to hack certain

174
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,560
features that accelerated the

175
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,599
compensation of web security testing

176
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,520
like nothing else I saw in that era

177
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,979
Metasploit came out I could pop any

178
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,599
major corporation by hitting one button

179
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,639
go hack this Corporation Metasploit

180
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,160
wonderful tool to come out I had a sizzo

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,020
at a meeting once tell me this is not

182
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,259
right anyone can grab Metasploit and

183
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,660
easily own my whole Corporation and I'm

184
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,120
like I have an idea maybe you should

185
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,220
hire someone to run that tool and do it

186
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,680
for you and then fix those things he's

187
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,300
like yeah well you know that sounds like

188
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,860
a lot of work oh yeah it is a lot of

189
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,199
it's a lot of work buddy it is so what

190
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
else we have so devops who's doing

191
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,180
devops who's like oh yeah devops like

192
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,399
everywhere well the most in the room are

193
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,380
interacting with devops in some way

194
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,620
right that only really started in 2009

195
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,958
at Etsy this is a Lackey and Nick

196
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,020
Galbreath doing the first major major

197
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,540
devops program where they're now like

198
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,240
every developer's checking in PHP code

199
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,500
sorry um checking in PHP code right and

200
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,820
they're going through a whole battery of

201
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,880
security testing as early as 2009 that's

202
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
when devops really starts in my opinion

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,060
2010 is where spdx comes out the first

204
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,060
real s-bomb now everyone's s-bombing

205
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,339
this s bombing that by the way you get

206
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,560
an s-bomb that's great you gotta

207
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,420
actually update your freaking libraries

208
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,040
before you actually do security running

209
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,140
an s-bomb gives you zero security go

210
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,459
update your libraries then we'll talk

211
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,940
all right moving on 2013 defect Dojo

212
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,200
begins with the local Austin

213
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,540
professional this is an individual Dave

214
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,320
Anderson who builds out an entire

215
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,940
orchestration framework from scratch

216
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,160
he's a professional developer so we plug

217
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,959
in all the open source scanning tools of

218
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,700
the day you have the whole orchestration

219
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,000
framework it's open sourced at OAS back

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,540
in back in 2013 and we just passed 10

221
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,519
million downloads of this little OAS

222
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,040
project that's serious downloads at this

223
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,740
point so now we're at oh wasp pushing

224
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,380
out free infrastructure software to

225
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,560
handle devops workflows that was 2013

226
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,200
when this came out not that long ago

227
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,420
what else do we got here if you two more

228
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,000
things we have 2015 dependency check

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,480
this is uh Jeremy Long at Wells Fargo

230
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,200
one of the software composition analysis

231
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,700
vendors who I'm not going to mention

232
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,040
their name in public at least

233
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,200
went into Jeremy's office and quoted

234
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,080
them some astronomical number for their

235
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,580
tool like five million dollars well

236
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,320
you're a bank you can afford it he's

237
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,060
like I know your pricing you are like

238
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,620
tripling your price because i'm a bank

239
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,240
that's not right and they're like come

240
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,740
on you can afford it he's like get out

241
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,940
of my office and he kicked him out of

242
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,800
the building as this vendor was leaving

243
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,320
they were like go ahead Jeremy go build

244
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
it yourself good luck buddy guess what

245
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,399
Jeremy started doing the next day he

246
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,399
built the OAS dependency check tool

247
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,740
which the same vendor wrote about saying

248
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,240
oh you shouldn't use that because we're

249
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,500
better we're commercial they actually

250
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,560
had to counter his product open source I

251
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,959
love this story so Jeremy is a warrior

252
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,880
he's up every morning at five o'clock

253
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,160
with this vendor behind him saying go

254
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,779
ahead Jeremy build it yourself he's like

255
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,220
yeah I'll build it myself and he did

256
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,519
every morning 5 a.m cranking this out

257
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,579
it's now one of our Flagship projects a

258
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,680
real world tool to do software

259
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,200
composition analysis which every vendor

260
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,360
in this space looks at like oh yeah we

261
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,620
do something better than that it's a

262
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,140
good it's a Baseline for for this very

263
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,459
important part of our industry 2020

264
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,360
and we're now past 2020 we're hitting

265
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,940
Next Generation stuff 2020 we see the

266
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,640
threat modeling Manifesto announcing to

267
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
the world that this process this design

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,180
review process matters for software in

269
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,940
extremely big way up until that point I

270
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,440
would always talk trash about threat

271
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,540
modeling I don't like sitting in a room

272
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,240
talking about theoretical BS and just

273
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,300
but it's matured so much in the last

274
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,579
year when I read the manifesto that's

275
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,920
what changed my mind personally that

276
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,420
threat modeling does matter in our

277
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,240
industry I digress so where are we today

278
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,240
security testing is natively integrated

279
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,300
into GitHub the repo of the world

280
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,420
is the norm with static analysis Dynamic

281
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,339
analysis software composition analysis

282
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,279
and this is new category thing sorry

283
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,380
just kidding um contrast just kidding um

284
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,660
devsec Ops is now becoming the norm

285
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,300
quickly now pen test activities are

286
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,100
still expensive there's not enough

287
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,079
people out there so those of us who are

288
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,440
abstract professionals we have we have

289
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,240
our choice of where to work today so

290
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,800
keep that in mind you're doing

291
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,140
application security you're I don't mean

292
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,360
to say it just up to that your mom may

293
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,680
have told you that you really shouldn't

294
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,760
hear it's not too good for your

295
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,980
psychology psychology but those who do

296
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,519
an appsec you are special you are you

297
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,100
are very special you have your pick of

298
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,839
the litter of where you could work today

299
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,480
because we are in the highest demand of

300
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,160
almost any industry in the world right

301
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,680
now so pick well make sure you're happy

302
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,300
make sure you're finding a place where

303
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,279
you're getting what you want because

304
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,620
would a forever reason you're in this

305
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,380
industry your appsec pro and you are one

306
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,940
of the rock stars of the world right now

307
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,279
because we need so many of you so much

308
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,860
more of you to accomplish our goal of

309
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,440
managing the world security software so

310
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,860
we all something interesting OAS the um

311
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,279
the OAS testing guide is now being used

312
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,680
by compliance by some of the world's

313
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,420
largest software companies I don't know

314
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,160
if you know about this this project is

315
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,579
the OAS mobile testing security guide

316
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:31,560
this is amazing how well they've taken

317
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,839
our previous projects and matured it

318
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,079
into a really cutting-edge guide also

319
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,000
the mobile education security

320
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,339
verification standard it's run by a

321
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,600
different team than the main security

322
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,079
standard they are surgical with every

323
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,820
single word and every single requirement

324
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,279
I think it's useful this is why some of

325
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,079
the largest software companies in the

326
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,320
world have picked up the mobile asvs as

327
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,120
their standard when they're talking to

328
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,880
Regulators so anyone want to say oh oh

329
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,040
ask are they really influencing the

330
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,079
world you better believe it let me say

331
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,360
this again some of the world's largest

332
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,339
software developers have approached the

333
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,279
asvs teams and want to use our standard

334
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,139
for their standard for software

335
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,120
development when it comes to security so

336
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,399
they can convince Regulators get off

337
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,540
their butt and leave them alone that

338
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,100
they're following a neutral standard

339
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,100
that's how Olas is influencing the world

340
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,100
when it comes to security testing today

341
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,899
so here's let's do another history how

342
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,760
much how much time do I have conference

343
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,980
conference leaders time check how am I

344
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,100
doing

345
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,700
I have no idea what that means

346
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,920
I'm okay that's great let's talk about

347
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,380
the history of something technical let's

348
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,899
talk about https let's talk about

349
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,519
passwords and I'll get out of here so

350
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,959
https it starts back in 1994 where

351
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,380
Netscape Navigator Netscape creates the

352
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,959
initial version of https does anybody

353
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,880
know the story of how this was built

354
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,240
Moxie Marlin Spike of signal did a very

355
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,360
famous talk on on the original Engineers

356
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,260
built https so they built the original

357
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,180
protocol right combination of symmetric

358
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,160
and asymmetric crypto in transit put

359
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,459
together boom we have https what was

360
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,959
this uh sir tip why do we need a

361
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,820
certificate Authority in HTTPS all right

362
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,519
something technical why do we need a

363
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,320
certificate Authority for https anybody

364
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,399
what's that come on

365
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,779
but why what did they do what do they do

366
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,959
for us

367
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,399
they validate the identity of the public

368
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,220
certificate of of the of deliver of the

369
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,320
of the server delivering https Services

370
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,120
is one explanation of what that's about

371
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,820
now how this got created the engineer

372
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,000
who wrote the original version of SSL he

373
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,579
was like oh yeah that public key that

374
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,500
initial public key that could be

375
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,899
hijacked by an attacker so he built this

376
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,699
certificate Authority system as a hand

377
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,139
wave yeah I didn't realize it was gonna

378
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,220
be so important I kind of just like

379
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,019
threw it together at the end of the

380
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,180
protocol a couple sentences yeah you got

381
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,160
to validate that public key so the

382
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,399
entire certificate Authority system that

383
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,860
runs the pki of the world today was

384
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,740
built as a hand wave by an engineer and

385
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,740
and it shows sorry no offense no events

386
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,839
and shows it shows right okay let me let

387
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,260
me go so 1990 99 we got tls10 that was

388
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,660
it was super complicated they're like

389
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,480
okay let's take every possible thing we

390
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
can do in a transport protocol and throw

391
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,399
it into TLS one it's too complicated

392
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,940
ended up being crap but in 1999 it was

393
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,740
an outstanding improvement from the

394
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,339
dumpster fire that was SSL 3.0 the 2006

395
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,560
2008 now we see some really good stuff

396
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,040
2006 TLS 1.1 comes out it's problematic

397
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,680
but a lot better TLS one two comes out

398
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,740
it's complicated right I know a lot of

399
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,480
your Facebook status relationship status

400
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,459
what is it complicated I know it's okay

401
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,160
it's okay TLS one two it's super

402
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,839
complicated

403
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,859
but it's it's doing a lot right now I

404
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,299
don't run it on my server anymore we're

405
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,199
going to talk a little bit more about

406
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,819
tls13 but 2009 this researcher I've

407
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,339
enriched anyone know Ivan ristic he's

408
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,339
mad man he's why like Ivan ristic is

409
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,439
he's one of the people in an industry

410
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,500
who looks at a standard says I want to

411
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,640
understand this protocol

412
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,980
Sheen and he's not getting around he and

413
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,440
that kind of intellect that kind of

414
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,200
desire to understand application

415
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
security at the bit level is what his

416
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,200
brain put into SSL Labs now Ivan doesn't

417
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,480
work for qualis anymore but what he

418
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,080
wrote in SSL Labs is still today the de

419
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,440
facto standard of how we measure the TLs

420
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,419
web services and websites around the

421
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,059
world so I watch Ivan's career he went

422
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,980
he built his own product hard knives and

423
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,260
just whatever he does I'm very impressed

424
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,760
with I'm not saying this because I'm

425
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,500
affiliated with him in any way I'm

426
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,880
saying this because I want to highlight

427
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,299
someone who changed the world of TLS I

428
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,520
remember when he pushed out SSL labs in

429
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
2009 now when I was younger I was a

430
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,620
little a little less a little less a

431
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,240
little more Troublesome we'll say maybe

432
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,059
so I went on to Twitter and I tweeted

433
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,900
out the SSL Labs URL of every major app

434
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,840
set company and their grade like sigital

435
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,200
John Steven wherever you you are F and

436
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,900
like you know aspect security was not an

437
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,580
a you know so all these big companies

438
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,400
with very bad TLS scores because a

439
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,980
public engine just came out so a bunch

440
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,840
of folks from digital who are now my

441
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,059
friends good friends of mine start like

442
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,160
tweeting like well this is not anako

443
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,960
this is not right he's just he's just

444
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,520
playing games these grades don't

445
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,380
actually matter and they start like

446
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,299
attacking me because I was sending out

447
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,919
TLS links so this is getting like

448
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,419
Twitter Drama Oh My Favorite Twitter

449
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,720
application security drama my favorite

450
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,640
so Ivan jumps in it says one thing and

451
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,919
he's like all you companies giving Mr

452
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,900
maniko a hard time I got a suggestion

453
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,299
for you go fix your server and leave Jim

454
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,640
alone like yeah thank you Ivan thank you

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,059
anyways so SSL Labs was fun because it

456
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,799
leveled the playing field we can now

457
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,080
look at each other's website with an

458
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,260
extremely mature engine to see how well

459
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,720
we've well tuned https and that

460
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,299
radically started this exponential

461
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,960
growth of getting TLS and https right

462
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,720
and now we hit the modern era 2010

463
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,380
Chrome preloads starts preloading some

464
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,720
sites with strict Transport Security and

465
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,480
starts catching a lot of a lot of big

466
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,400
governments doing spying around the

467
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,160
world oh yes it's so when Chrome starts

468
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,960
to preload they can detect different

469
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,480
kinds of interception fire sheet comes

470
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,220
out in this era anyone play with fire

471
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,039
sheep or remember that

472
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,080
overnight I'm able to hijack anyone's

473
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,000
Gmail and Facebook account at the coffee

474
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,580
shop without any kind of real work that

475
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,940
Excel this was available what like oh

476
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,000
like 13 years ago I could in a trivial

477
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,280
way hijack people's account at a coffee

478
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,980
shop this is how far we've come that's

479
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,200
like a decade ago how are we doing today

480
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,820
we're about to see today is a much

481
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,480
different story 2011 Ford secrecy goes

482
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,120
live and again this is anti-spying kind

483
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,440
of kind of Transport Security 2013 TLS

484
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,440
one two it's complicated but like your

485
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,419
relation status it's live in modern

486
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,580
browsers and it's live everywhere and

487
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,559
very quickly becomes the more prominent

488
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,520
protocol 2015 let's encrypt shows up and

489
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,820
getting a good a good well-managed TLS

490
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,640
cert becomes free for everybody and by

491
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,880
2016 half of the web is https by 2017

492
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,260
like a certificate uh certificate

493
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Authority authorization certificate

494
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,179
Authority authentication one of those

495
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,299
one of those auth that that goes live so

496
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,940
this is a real public record of

497
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,700
everybody registering sites to make sure

498
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,220
that terrible certificate Authority

499
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,799
system is doing is doing a better job or

500
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,900
we at least have visibility into when

501
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,940
that system screws up which it does a

502
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,240
lot in 2018 let's encryptos wild card

503
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,679
that's epic TLS one three is now live in

504
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,860
Firefox and chrome as early as 2018 and

505
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,159
why is tls13 revolutionary

506
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,299
it is

507
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,600
this is such a amazing Improvement of

508
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,179
this critical protocol to our industry

509
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,760
so why does tls13 change everything

510
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,220
because we're simplifying it in a

511
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,580
radical way we see that the

512
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,260
configuration options drop to almost

513
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,600
nothing the number of ciphers it

514
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,120
supports is very low and this is one of

515
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,000
the most epic Transport Security

516
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,159
protocols in modern history it's

517
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,039
becoming the the the default across all

518
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,080
of our services and it's working it's

519
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,720
not just working it's working extremely

520
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,900
well and not just that what I I swear I

521
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,159
swear I actually shed a tear when I

522
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,520
heard about this in 2021

523
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,600
the first of all the pki Consortium was

524
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,720
formed in the From the Ashes of the casc

525
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,179
uh Consortium this is the a secret

526
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,000
browser cabal that would decide who was

527
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,919
going to be the authorities of this

528
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,900
current ERA for all the browsers that

529
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,580
can turn into a formal Consortium

530
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,980
recently and right about that time

531
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,799
Chrome 91 now defaults everything https

532
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,780
and that changes everything now when

533
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,419
your mom your grandma your your sister

534
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,760
when she goes and punches in a website

535
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,299
that defaults https and fact around the

536
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,840
same era Safari when you punch in an

537
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,140
HTTP link they'll check to see if https

538
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,720
is live first and go there instead

539
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,159
so

540
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,799
where have we come in a matter of like

541
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,880
94 2000 a matter of like like less than

542
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,340
30 years we went from having the

543
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,620
authority system being a hand wave

544
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,400
to being one of the most

545
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,440
authorities is what was one of the most

546
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,780
rigorous Transport Security protocols

547
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,260
that drives the secure web today

548
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,520
this work it works well and it took

549
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,400
hundreds of BR of brainiacs protocol

550
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,159
level it's similar to get us to where we

551
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,240
are today

552
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,360
again I want to go back and say

553
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,860
sometimes your job is difficult and

554
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,200
you're stressed out and you're triaging

555
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,419
a report it doesn't feel like you're

556
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,640
making any progress I ask you to zoom

557
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,460
out think of this story where we go from

558
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,880
this crap protocol that's a hand wave to

559
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,860
this protocol that is now something that

560
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,220
can defend the world from introspection

561
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,500
and and what is it confidentiality

562
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,720
integrity and authenticity we can

563
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,520
provide that now across the world in a

564
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,980
robust way in all of our services today

565
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,320
and that was not the case just a couple

566
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,360
decades ago that's where we've come

567
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,980
we've come a long way baby is what I'm

568
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,940
trying to say

569
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,559
how about time check how much time do I

570
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,000
got we got time for one more of these

571
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,679
history

572
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,419
we got this so Chrome 90 and 91 defaults

573
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,360
to https and this is where the the

574
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,179
previous era of Transport Security ends

575
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,520
and the modern era begins because the

576
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,740
error we're in we're going to see a

577
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,679
hundred percent of the web be https and

578
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,500
we're going to see HTTP go away in a

579
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,360
very short amount of time so here's

580
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,380
stats from this month right 96 of all

581
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,140
pages loaded by Chrome my Mac OS is

582
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,320
https and to take a look back to March

583
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,480
15 same era 2015 43

584
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,100
not too long ago

585
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,980
how far have we come in a short time it

586
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,380
amazes me when I think about the history

587
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,600
of what we're doing in this industry and

588
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,080
I gotta practice

589
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,360
I got CAA all configured and I hope you

590
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,299
do as well check your website fix your

591
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,000
configuration right let's move on one

592
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,260
more password history so 1961 this is

593
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,140
password and password storage history we

594
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,080
go back to Ferdinando carbato he's a

595
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,419
project leader and a brilliant leader

596
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,360
and a super sharp he's one of those guys

597
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,799
who like drinks like four cups of coffee

598
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,779
in the morning super energetic running

599
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,559
four or five teams and he's building MIT

600
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,760
ctss from scratch the first like

601
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,100
multi-user like robust computer in the

602
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,140
planet and he's like leading this team

603
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,960
now what he didn't realize is he is the

604
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,020
first engineer in the world to design a

605
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,480
password system he's got a master file

606
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,880
with the passwords in it that we you

607
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,500
need to verify against during the login

608
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,020
and his team as they built this they're

609
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,600
like certainly other people have thought

610
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,440
of this well Fernando no one had you're

611
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,360
the first engineer to come up with a

612
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,539
password strategy again that's mit's

613
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:34,200
ctss in 1961 we see the first password

614
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,440
system built to defend software now you

615
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,360
tell me what's next in this historical

616
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
view of passwords what's next someone

617
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,059
builds a first password system what does

618
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,380
the next person do

619
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,240
they hack it right

620
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,059
so I'm gonna give actually now there's

621
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,820
another professor in 65 who found a bug

622
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,220
that story is not nearly as fun so I'm

623
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,779
gonna I'm gonna boot him from from

624
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,460
history even though he belongs in the

625
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,919
pole position I'm gonna give Alan share

626
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,400
some cred here so he's a PhD student and

627
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,799
he knew that he knew how to get he was

628
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,480
he was already given privileged access

629
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,120
because he was a researcher working on

630
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,940
this operating system so he had root

631
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,299
access and everybody wanted access to

632
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,520
this computer this is brilliant multi

633
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,919
high-end computer of the era so because

634
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,600
he was a root user as one of the

635
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,059
researchers he would like give himself a

636
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,340
lot of extra time by modifying the

637
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,960
operating system code he was root access

638
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,840
that he would actually re delete the

639
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,480
time he was using from the timeshare so

640
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,700
he can use whenever he wanted to and for

641
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,100
years this researcher is hacking the

642
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,779
machine well not really he had Rude

643
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,940
access he's taking advantage of his root

644
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,000
access to literally modify the OS so

645
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,820
they wouldn't see the time he was using

646
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,919
so he can use more time to another Peach

647
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,600
student this is not very ethical by the

648
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,860
way

649
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,500
they did it and they and he finished the

650
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,559
research project at MIT and they removed

651
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,200
admin access from him and he's like I

652
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,539
need my admin access back what he

653
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,240
realizes is the print he's and this

654
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,640
guy's been looking at the code for years

655
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,760
now to maintain his own access so how

656
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,559
does he break in he figures out that the

657
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,720
mastered password file with the right

658
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,480
command is printable so he prints out

659
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,700
the mastered password list and he has

660
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,740
the passwords of the whole system so

661
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,900
that's what he privilege escalation an

662
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,539
unprotected file when he was not a root

663
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,120
user he could print out and he becomes

664
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,000
the first password hacker in history to

665
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,400
get more time on his machine to get his

666
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,279
PhD high five Alan share you are a part

667
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,640
of history now 1970 is when a real

668
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,100
password protection algorithm comes out

669
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,320
this is Crypt three now this released in

670
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,400
Unix but they grabbed this from the old

671
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,340
m209 code from World War II this is in

672
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,559
the units up to the sixth edition just

673
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,900
for the record

674
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,940
cryptography but it was the beginning of

675
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,880
modern password storage it came from

676
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,080
this

677
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,679
physical device that was used by the

678
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,419
Allies in World War II to protect our

679
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,080
our military communication right now

680
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,140
1978 Crypt is now based off of Des the

681
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,299
seventh edition but even though this is

682
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,700
a bad algorithm by today's standards we

683
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,559
see for the first time password

684
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,159
stretching password salting and a real

685
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,620
password policy enforced at the crypto

686
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,720
level this is a great start we jump

687
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,820
ahead in history to the 80s

688
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,120
and we see that Unix is finally

689
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,000
um limiting password database to root

690
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,600
users only so a nod to Alan share you're

691
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,399
like you're printing out root level

692
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,919
password you're you're printing out what

693
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,919
should be root level password files from

694
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,919
a multi-user machine in 66 and we didn't

695
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,600
really get around to fixing that into

696
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,940
the 80s high five to you out and share

697
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,960
wherever you are 1991 md5 comes out why

698
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,120
should I bring up md5 and password

699
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,520
storage history we shouldn't because you

700
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,200
shouldn't be using md5 for password

701
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,140
storage damn it but we spent like a

702
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,799
decade doing this to our own Chagrin I

703
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,500
still see systems from major companies

704
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
implementing password storage with md5

705
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,539
from scratch and it hurts me it does it

706
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:28,799
hurts me 1995 I'm sorry 1994 Crypt 3 is

707
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,020
increasing consideration count it has a

708
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,679
now 48 bit size salt to deduplicate

709
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,240
passwords in storage when and they're

710
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,419
the same we're getting good here and 97

711
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,899
Loft crack comes out this is epic right

712
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,140
Loft crack lets us up Windows passwords

713
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,419
pretty easily and it's the first

714
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:51,179
cracking tool that does dictionary

715
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,059
attacks that does brute force attacks

716
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,220
hybrid attacks and rainbow tables all in

717
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,480
one tool today's tool is Hash cat

718
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,220
hashcat does all of this and more it's

719
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,779
one of the most amazing password

720
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,000
cracking software programs on the planet

721
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,880
but hashcat came from the work of Loft

722
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,620
crack which started the password

723
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,159
cracking industry in my opinion now 99

724
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,140
we have the first of the good password

725
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,740
store algorithms coming out be Crypt be

726
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,559
Crypt today at a work Factor 10 is still

727
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,720
a reasonable algorithm and it came out

728
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,159
decades ago in 2000 we got pbk df2 if

729
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,140
you look at the OAS password storage

730
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,940
cheat sheet if you're building a fips

731
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,159
compliant system we give you exact

732
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,440
advice a and how to use this algorithm

733
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,260
also good today for U.S federal systems

734
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,880
in 2007 PHP has a built-in password

735
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,520
protection algorithm using beatcrypt if

736
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,399
it's available and by 2009 colon

737
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,380
Percival publishes s Crypt in 2015

738
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,799
argon2 we want to use to ID today wins

739
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,720
the password hashing competition and

740
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,520
these algorithms have stood the test of

741
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,299
time and are still good today

742
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,820
2016 is a famous day and password

743
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,179
protection History Dr akaway from

744
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,779
Dropbox brilliant brilliant architect he

745
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,159
publishes this article which in detail

746
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,960
explains the crypto that they're using

747
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,419
at Dropbox to protect their password

748
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,200
just take some cojones to literally

749
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,820
describe your protection strategy to the

750
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,820
world and among my fellow instructors we

751
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,460
refer to this as the canonical way to

752
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,340
store or a password for about a decade I

753
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,440
wouldn't use bcrypt anymore though I

754
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,960
don't think it's 72 byte limit is a node

755
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,820
is a deal breaker for me we'll just

756
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,980
pre-hash then I have bite problems we'll

757
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,860
just pay 64 in code then prehash then

758
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,779
use bcrypt I'm like okay I'm done I'm

759
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,220
done with that I'm I'm gonna use

760
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,020
something else at this point but he

761
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,539
publishes an article that gives us a

762
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,700
really good formula at one of the most

763
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,860
using one of the most common available

764
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,799
algorithms and it changes the world of

765
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,100
password storage from that point on

766
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,899
2019 is the end of modern password

very surgically give you advice so we

787
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,918
suggest if you're if you care more about

788
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,739
CPU and you want to minimize your CPU

789
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,800
use 37 Megs of memory one degree of

790

parallelism and one iteration count if

791
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,239
you're more concerned about RAM usage

792
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,760
then use 15 Megs of memory two degree

793
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,800
two iteration counts and one degree of

794

protect past systems you're building

800
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,839
we've come a long way in a very short

801
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,599
amount of time I'm going to I'm out of

802
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,339
time here I'm really proud of all the

803
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:48,960
owas projects we've seen throughout

804
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,839
history these have changed my life as a

805
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,580
professional they've changed the life of

806
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,159
my customers and we've done a great job

807
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,619
helping the world secure their software

808

809
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,099
that you've all done the work that we've

810
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,740
all done the flagship projects and our

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,760
is that you're doing education and

815
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,339
that's what we do we've taught thousands

816
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,020
and thousands of developers and other

817
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,300
professionals around the world how to do

818
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,940
application security for free to help

819
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,040
make the world a more secure place and I

820
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,619
do believe in this the history of xss is

821
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,180
also fascinating I'm going to say one

822
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,140
thing Robert Hanson I mean Robert Hanson

823
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,079
in 2004 he proposed the content

824
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,460
restriction standard in 2004 that became

825
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,400
content security policy in 2012. I don't

826
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,660
think a lot of people know this history

827
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,520
this is one of the most important

828
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,980
standards to block cross-site scripting

829
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,680
it works it works well this all came

830
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,560
from a local Austin boy named Robert

831
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,920
Hanson who who's like our snake one of

832
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,960
the original hackers in our industry so

833
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,780
wherever you are Robert Hansen Every

834
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,640
Time I Think of content security policy

835
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,500
I think of you I know I think history

836
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,900
forgets where the standard came from I

837
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,240
don't and I appreciate you also trusted

838
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,980
types from Kris Kristoff is changing the

839
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,300
world we we have Dom purify a focal

840
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,820
point library and exit test defense is

841
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,720
becoming a w3c standard it's so critical

842
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,240
appsec is now global we have 230

843
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,359
chapters around the world where Geeks

844
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,060
and nerds like us get together and talk

845
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,280
about how they can make the world a more

846
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
secure place and the work we do matters

847
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,040
